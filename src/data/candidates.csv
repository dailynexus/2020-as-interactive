Brieonni Johnson,max,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162704/brieonni-johnson.jpeg,,She/Her/Hers,2nd,Psychology and Brain Science,,,"I’m running to be a senator with the 73rd Senate because I want the 73rd A.S. to reflect and
represent its student body. My identities are not just part of who I am, but how I navigate the
world and how it perceives me. This includes my interactions in higher education such as
professors, students, and resources at my disposal. I do not see any other senators that represent
all of the intercommunal marginalized identities that I have such as being a black lesbian woman.
Though I do appreciate this unique experience, it also needs to be properly accounted for and
recognized to prevent silence or forgetting because issues that don’t necessarily affect everyone.
As someone that has gained experience in A.S. and has a valued interest in activism, I want to
represent a new underrepresented perspective that will bring more depth to the 73rd Senate. This
depth will not only be beneficial for the communities that I belong to but help unite all the
student communities! Not everyone is given equal resources and if we provide the same
opportunity and resources within our own education, Students of UCSB can properly align with
one another to have the best education possible. Bettering even the smallest of the communities
benefits all of us as a whole.","I have been involved in two different campus organizations in my second year of being a student at UC Santa Barbara. One of them is Zeta Sigma Nu Inc., a newly established sorority that is geared towards supporting marginalized students and giving them a “home away from home.” I
have worked as the Chief Justice for the Judicial Board, where I had to write the founding legal code with my judicial team that not only applies to our chapter but all future chapters. This has given me proper experience in the functioning of the formality of senate work. The other
component of my job is handling cases which has given me the opportunity to implement a neutral approach to situations and to properly apply justice when the situation needs it. The other organization is EVPSA Office or the Office of the External Vice President, which is dedicated to
helping all UC students and targeting as many ‘external’ issues. Under this office, I have workedas the Racial Justice Coordinator. This position has allowed me to be in A.S. spaces as a learner and fully understand the structure. With these experiences combined I believe I am prepared to
be a senator.","One resolution that I would like to introduce is a proposition standing with the San Marcos
Foothills. UC Santa Barbara is built on Chumash land and I believe a step towards reparations
would be to help preserve the last parts of Chumash land left. While our university can not buy
the land, the reselling of the land should be condemned by our university to stand in solidarity
with the Chumash people. Another resolution I would like to introduce is one standing in
solidarity with Asian students amidst the horrific hate crimes committed recently and advocating
for their safety at our institution. The last resolution that I would like to introduce is a
conversation concerning mental health and it’s intersectionalities, that the school’s resources
don’t properly fulfill but need to to support its student body.","I have wanted to be a senator since my freshman year and watching all the important work that our past senators have put into our associated body has been truly inspiring. I would like to not only continue their great work but to add to it. My focus is allocating the best resources for our student body that is not only in the best interest of the students but ultimately the entire school. Better resources will fuel better students and lead to a better school. I will work to achieve these goals by not only representing our fellow students in the senate, but multiple marginalized communities in our school that often feel unheard and ignored, and amplify their voices. Besides representation and resources, I want to make the Senate more accessible to everyone. Despite wanting to be a senator since freshman year, I didn’t feel like I had the proper knowledge to pursue that goal beforehand because A.S. felt like a complicated and separate world from the more casual organizations I had experienced, full of jargon and long legal documents that I had no prior experience with. My goal is to properly educate in a digestible manner the functions of A.S. to the common student so they do not have to feel intimidated. If students feel comfortable and confident, they will speak up and represent themselves properly which will allow senators to fully do their jobs for the students.","My platform for my senate campaign is centered around the mental wellbeing of our student body during remote instruction. This takes an embodiment in multiple forms and meanings for my platform. One of the campus resources I want to explore is better mental health resources, CAPS is a commonly known and recommended one for the general students. Even though it is a common resource, it is not very accessible and due to this a lot of students are neglected which negatively impacts not only their health but their education- which is ultimately our education. The best education that our community could possibly have is an education that is properly accessible and understood by all of its people. All of our students deserve a space where they can feel cared for and KNOW they’re cared for. My goal is to work on expanding the mental health resources so there are more therapists, therapists experienced in multiple or specific issues, and most importantly shorter access times. When students go seek these resources, it is often because they have exhausted all their other options. To tell a student that they must wait hours, days, or weeks to see someone when they need help at that moment is unacceptable for our students wellbeing.","While I hope remote instruction will not last for at least another year and a safe return to campus that will allow me to be more available to my peers than just through a zoom screen, remote instruction lasting for the next 2021-2022 year will need to be accounted for. I will make myself available to the student body by following the lead of some of the 72nd Senate members by having public media avenues (such as twitter or instagram) dedicated to my senate work, so the constituents can see all the work I’ve committed and can reach out with questions or statements. I also want to promote and share any resources or important information on not just my media, but have better contact with organizations on campus so information can access students more efficiently. By following these positive examples, I hope I can help foster an environment where students can trust and reach out to their student government despite us globally going through the darkest times.","What makes me the best candidate for this position is my concern for a better future and education at UC Santa Barbara for not only myself but all my fellow peers. Experience is impressive and admirable and I am proud of all of the knowledge I’ve gained through my work in Zeta Sigma Nu Inc. and EVPSA. Experience has helped me pursue this position but experience has nothing to do with character. Some people may not have intentions that center anyone in mind, such as wanting to be a senator to have a “more impressive” resume. There is nothing wrong with appreciating a potential perk, but I strongly believe this position is truly about serving the community and its best interest. This position, although limited, can bring so much positive growth or even just the push in the right direction but that is only if there is positive intention and action. Even if all I can do is push, there are other senators and senators after me if chosen wisely, will keep pushing. Someone who is truly passionate about human rights, advocates for UCSB students’ wellbeing and better education, and believes in the potential that our futures can have if pursued is what I will bring as a senator.",Left-leaning,"Very Good: The 72nd A.S. Senate has done a great job in learning to implement accountability, take action, and accessibility to students. The senators of this year’s senate have put in a lot of effort and work for our student body’s best interest despite this being the first year in remote instruction. That being said, despite all their work in addressing the needs of the student body, there is always room for improvement. An area I’d like to be targeted is the quality of remote learning for students.","Yes: There is no reason that A.S. UCSB shouldn’t vote in favor to divest in these companies, much less being the only undergraduate ASUC that hasn’t done so. A.S. can not be looking for the best intentions for their student body whilst supporting companies that profit off harming others.","Yes: I believe that UCSB should be tuition free because I believe in accessible and affordable education. It would be beneficial for not only low-income students but all students. This opportunity would breed a future where students come to higher education out of desire and not necessity, and stay in institutions out of passion and not financial obligation. A safe environment that unites students out of their common goals is what I believe is a core aspect of going to UC Santa Barbara and I would like to keep pushing towards that.","The mental health resources at UCSB are present and helpful but they are inadequate to accomodate for our entire student population and the multitudes of identities and experiences that could lead to them needing to access mental health help. To access the best resources and timely help, you need to have some sort of connection or an extremely dire situation. Even in the latter, I have heard of many students who needed immediate help and were pushed away by the long waiting periods or there was no help available for their issue. No student should ever be or feel denied to the proper help that they need. To address this issue, there needs to be more therapists in CAPS for the amount of students, but qualified therapists that properly reflect the student body and all experiences and identities that we hold. This would help but there is a deeper rooted issue with mental health in education that needs to be properly discussed with professors to not only keep in mind- but actually implement in their work and classes. Professors should have proper mental health training to accomodate for their students because especially with the difficult times we have suffered this past year, students deserve not words of sympathy from professors but actual guidance and respect for their situations.","I absolutely believe that the university could and should have handled the situation regarding
multiple allegations of large gatherings and parties by Greek life. Long, apologetic emails about
the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected such a large proportion of it’s student body and its
families but passively saying that students can report the parties was not appropriate. Our
university should be taking active action like enforcing the same party restrictions that are given
during Halloween or Deltopia that could have been used for the entirety of this pandemic. Even
if students can report, not everyone knows who’s partying, their name, or addresses. All we
know is that we see people partying and nothing be done about it in our knowledge. If there are
consequences, they are not harsh enough to actually stop anyone from partying, as we’ve seen
multiple allegations that are going to be “handled” but some of the same groups are still partying
and endangering themselves and the people of Isla Vista. For possibly risking the lives of other
people, I believe a suspension or expulsion should be the least the school could do.","I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its functions, it is a wonderful campus resource that has a lot of dedicated staff and working students that are fully designated to help students who may seek their resource for a very traumatic experience. Despite this resource, there is always more work to be done especially in terms of our university. An experience that sticks out to me is my freshman year, the fear I felt during multiple allegations of not just one but a couple of fraternities concerning sexual assault. So many students and survivors were justifiably angered by the news because not only the environment that they’re supposed to be protected in, they aren’t even safe in. There needs to be more from our university than saying they stand with survivors or education on consent, a complete lack of tolerance for these inexcusable actions is what we need. The university can not provide a safe space for their students if they do not take account when our safety is endangered and properly restore it.","I do not believe UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups as someone who is Black and LGBTQ+. I cannot speak for other identities as a member, but speaking as an ally, they are just as neglected by the university and deserve better. The Black population of UCSB students is 5%, which is an extreme underrepresentation of black students in the US. This issue isn’t necessarily fixed by just admitting more black students (although preferred) but allocating proper and stable resources for black students. There is no point in admitting communities with various issues if there is little to none to support them through their issues. My freshman year at UCSB, I lived in the Black Scholars Hall and although I enjoyed it, it was sad to realize that the 15-30 of us in Santa Rosa Hall was the largest amount that the Black Scholars Hall ever had. Worst of all, I had to not only experience but witness my friends experience microaggressions and racism on a daily basis from their peers. At times, experiences were so bad people felt compelled to leave this place that they were supposed to be welcomed in. Watching friends go because of things out of their control and fighting to advocate for myself in every space- whether an organization, classroom, or even to a professor- is what has inspired my platform centering on this university being a safe space for every student. No one deserves to go through what past or current marginalized students go through just to access a higher education that they earned their way into.",,"Even though I am someone running for the position as a senator, I am still an average student. As
mentioned frequently before, I have always taken in interest in A.S. Senate but like anyone new
to it, I was intimidated by the inaccessibility. I didn’t really understand the parties, their purpose,
what resolutions or bills were or what they actually did, legal code, or numerous other aspects of
the Senate that seemed so foreign. Luckily, there are already active steps being taken such as
active social medias by some senators that detail updates of their work as well as being a means
of communication to any student. Something I want to implement is an online accessible
presentation “A.S. Simplified”. I learned what A.S. was through an hour presentation my first
year and without it, I truly wouldn’t even know what A.S. is. Further steps that I want to take is a
more beginner-friendly website for A.S. that new students can go to learn more about their
student government and get any help that they need.","Unfortunately, with our current circumstances in this pandemic there is a large amount of
uncertainty of where our future will lead. With the large number of cases of not only COVID-19 but large group gatherings in Isla Vista as well as the vaccination just surfacing and thebeginning of rolling out to the general public, I can not safely predict anything due to just everything being sincerely unpredictable even though I would like to say we will return to ‘normal’ very soon. In the role of a senator, I would not want to give my student body any false promises. I will confidently say that I will do whatever deemed necessary of my position to fulfill the quickest and safest transition back to in-person instruction and in-person activity in Isla Vista. Ideally, this could begin with strict consequences on partying and levelling down on cases while the vaccination rates rise. This combined with weekly testing and daily questions, should at the very at least maintain stability and prevent an increase. This could gradually lead up to small in-person classes being open or small organizations being able to meet up on campus, then slowly increasing the sizes until we can fully return back to the in-person, full, and beautiful campus that we all miss.","I believe the university succeeded in certain aspects of our still ongoing coronavirus pandemic and remote instruction. Last spring quarter, during a boiling point of anti-black violence and  hostility, students were given optional finals and additional help. I believe that was very beneficial for Black students and very appropriate for the given events. UCSB also extended the Pass/No Pass deadline which was very helpful considering these unpredictable times. I believe the university failed in long-term addressing the issue and accountability. There is still a deadly virus pandemic, there are still people dying, and students struggling due to numerous reasons and students are still expected to perform to fullest capacity in remote instruction. Students are given words of, “Let me know how I can support you all during these difficult times...” but not remote instruction that properly accommodates for their given situations. Students are paying an expensive tuition for professors that have the OPTION to be empathetic to them and properly adjust during a global pandemic. Students are paying fees and dues for on-campus resources that won’t or can’t even access. This complete neglect of our environment and our well being has killed the inner student in so many great minds and that is the biggest failure.",,,,,,,
Caria Lee,max,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162711/caria-lee.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,2nd,Political Science and Sociology,,,"I am running to be an off-campus senator because I love UCSB and I want to create the best
college experience for both current and future students. This year has been extremely difficult
with both the pandemic and increasing political polarization. Personally, as a member of a
minority group, it has been hard to see the rising hate crimes and discrimination that so many are
facing today. If elected as a senator I would hope to focus on inclusion and acceptance by
advocating for and amplifying the voices of all marginalized communities. I believe that by
listening and working with the student body we can create a safe and welcoming environment for
all. I also believe that being a senator would allow me to directly make a difference as I am
passionate about many issues, such as increasing safety in Isla Vista, promoting sustainable
measures on campus, decreasing excessive policing, advocating for rent control, working to
eliminate rape culture at UCSB, and continuing to address food insecurity. It would be an honor
to represent UCSB students as a member of the AS Senate and work on issues to better our
campus and community as a whole. Overall, I truly want to work together and create the best
possible environment for everyone.","This is actually my first year being a part of Associated Students and I am currently a fellow in
the office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA). This quarter, I had the
pleasure to begin working with a team to increase accessibility to the A.S. Food Bank and better
address food insecurity in Isla Vista. Attending weekly office meetings has provided me with the
opportunity to hear from other coordinators who work on various issues such as food waste and
community safety. From this experience, I believe that I have a good understanding of different
problems that I would like to address during this upcoming school year. Besides being a Pearman
Fellow for A.S., I am also an active member of Phi Alpha Delta - the pre-law fraternity on
campus. We have recently established a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee. The purpose
of this committee is to remain educated on current issues and to make sure, as a fraternity, we do
our best to remain inclusive. I have been able to further learn about a variety of issues regarding
gender, sexuality, sexual assault, and harassment that I would like to further explore with the
A.S. Senators and make sure that we are doing our part to ensure our campus is welcoming and
inclusive.","As an off-campus senator, I believe it is my responsibility to advocate for safe and affordable
housing in Isla Vista for UCSB students. Students are paying too much for housing that is
undesirable and sometimes even unsafe. For this reason, I would like to discuss passing a
positional and directional resolution directing the five executive officers of the Associated
Students to lobby and advocate for rent control and a rent cap in Isla Vista to the County Board
of Supervisors. Second, I would like to address safety concerns in IV. There are a lot of
improvements necessary, but one solution I hope to introduce is a positional resolution
advocating for increased lighting in Isla Vista in the blocks further away from campus (67 and
68). I believe this would provide some more comfort to students who, like me, live on these
darker, less populated streets while walking in IV at night. Third, I would like to introduce a
positional resolution demanding the addition of anti-Indigenous, anti-Asian, anti- Latinx, and
anti-Black implicit bias training in Gaucho FYI. Oftentimes hate crimes in Isla Vista are not
discussed and I believe that these trainings are necessary to stir important conversations while
keeping the student body educated and inclusive.","There are many platforms that I am passionate about addressing, but put simply, I mainly want to advocate for safety and inclusivity. One of the biggest things that we must prepare for in consideration of the upcoming school year will be the potential transition to in-person classes, as well as the providing of safe environments for all students. In addition to safety regarding the virus, I also want to focus on general safety in Isla Vista. Recently, there has been a lot of safety concerns from students due to the attempted kidnapping in Goleta and other frightening events. Also, as I mentioned above, I ensure that I would listen to the voices of our student body and advocate for the support of all marginalized communities. Although there is a lot that I have to learn about regarding the struggles that different marginalized communities face, I would hope to collaborate with organizations representing these groups in order to listen to their needs and concerns to make sure that I am representing them to the best of my ability. I would also like to work towards defunding IV Foot Patrol and UCPD. In my opinion, their presence tends to make students feel more unsafe, especially members of the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ community. If they
are not promoting the safety of all students their presence is not only useless but
counterproductive as well. I believe a more inclusive and effective way to combat safety concerns would be to collaborate with community organizations instead of UCPD and IVFP.","There are many organizations I would hope to work with for my different platforms. Since one of the major tenants of my campaign is inclusivity, I would hope to work with organizations that represent underrepresented communities. Specifically, I would love to work with organizations such as the UCSB American Indian and Indigenous Student Association (AIISA) and UCSB Trans and Queer Commission. These are organizations I have begun following recently, however, I have a strong interest to learn from them about how I can better support these students at UCSB. I also am very passionate about advocating for safe and affordable housing in Isla Vista. As an off-campus senator, I feel as though this is a very important issue to tackle. I would hope to work with the Isla Vista Tenants Union to see how I can assist their mission and what I should be working towards as a senator. Another platform that I am extremely passionate about is promoting sustainability. I would love to work with the Environmental Justice Association (EJA) to see what sustainable measures could be implemented and what we should be trying to increase awareness of in Isla Vista. Lastly, I would love to work with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) to see how we can better support survivors and provide them a platform to share their stories. These are just a few of the organizations I hope to work with and learn from if I am elected as a senator.","If I am elected as a senator, I would hope to constantly update students about what the Senate is working on so that they remain aware and informed. I think one of the best ways to make myself available in a remote school year would be to utilize social media. I am very active on Instagram and as a senator, I would make a separate account where students could see exactly what I am working on. I would also actively promote my office hours on both my personal and senator accounts so that students could come to talk to me about any issues that they feel need to be addressed. If students would feel more comfortable discussing their questions over Facetime or by text messages instead of coming to office hours, I would have no problem organizing these meetings in order to be as welcoming as possible. In addition to office hours, I would ask for feedback from students through Instagram story functions such as polls or question boxes. I am also involved in a few on-campus organizations and I would do my best to make it known that I would be available to talk about any issues that they are interested in or concerned with. I would  hope that by doing this, the student body will be able to see how much I value their input and truly want to represent them to the best of my ability.","I believe that I am the best candidate to be an off-campus senator because I truly believe in the ability of the students to bring about change. I also understand what an honor it would be to represent the UCSB student body as a member of the A.S. Senate. For this reason, I recognize the importance of listening before acting. I would want the people who may better understand an issue, possibly due to their background and personal experiences, to speak first. I want to prioritize amplifying the voices of students who might not have a platform to speak for themselves. Thus, for this reason, I strive to make myself as approachable and accessible as possible. Moreover, I am a quick learner and love collaborating with a team to reach an important goal. I am bold and have no qualms in standing up for what I believe in and in what students need. I am passionate about making a difference in students’ lives and hope to continue educating myself on the various issues that affect our campus and community. I know that I have the dedication that it takes to be a senator representing UCSB students and the drive to serve our community to the best of my ability.",Left-leaning,"Excellent: The 71st Senate was forced to work with truly unprecedented circumstances. Despite this difficulty, I believe they did the best that they could, especially working on Covid Relief Grants. Additionally, after speaking with a former senator, I realized how dedicated they were to serving students to the best of their ability. For example, when there was a military coup in Myanmar, the Senate members acted quickly, writing a bill that very night to help students as soon as possible. I admire their dedication to the UCSB student body, despite the less-than-ideal circumstances.",Yes: I would like to discuss a resolution divesting from these companies because I do not support human rights violations.,"Yes: I actually believe that all universities should be tuition-free. In my opinion, there shouldn’t be a cost that limits individuals from pursuing higher education. A.S. has advocated for a tuition-free university in the past and supported solutions such as the 48$ fix. I would like to continue these efforts if I am elected.","I think that UCSB has put in effort into making its mental health services well-known. This is great and shows that they care about students’ well-being. However, I have spoken to friends about the university’s mental health services, such as CAPS, and there are a number of things that could be improved upon. First, many have felt that their conversations with CAPS counselors were basic and not solution-based. This led to them wondering about what the meeting had achieved and if it was worth it. Second, the distance between appointments is around 2 weeks and it can be difficult to even book one. A few friends of mine actually stopped using CAPS because of how infrequent the meetings were. They felt as though there was not enough being accomplished to continue attending. I feel that improvements are necessary, especially after the loss of a student earlier this year. I would advocate for increasing the number of staff members to increase availability or even providing more solution-based training. While these changes are only possible with increased funding, I personally feel that this is necessary in order to better support our student body and to ensure that they receive the support that they need.","I definitely think that the response to partying definitely could have been handled better by the
university. To be completely honest, I don’t think there is adequate enforcement of rules at all
and it took a long time for the university to act. Despite social media accounts such as
@ucsb.party that are dedicated to bringing awareness to the parties in IV, there are almost no
repercussions for students engaging in these acts. And unfortunately, many of the individuals
engaging in partying have ties to greek life. The organizations are not holding their members
accountable because the school is not holding these organizations accountable. Additionally,
many law enforcement officers who are supposed to be stopping these acts refuse to wear masks
and follow social distancing orders themselves. This combination has led to leniency and an
ineffective system of dealing with this issue. I think punishments would differ depending on the
situation, but individuals should be held accountable for their actions. Personally, I think that
people throwing parties should be fined as the law says and that organizations breaking these
rules should be put on probation. This may seem harsh, but I believe that it is necessary in order
to end these public health violations and protect students. Safety should be the number one
priority; allowing these events to go unchecked is the exact opposite of what we should be doing.
Students want to return to normal, in-person activity, but this can only happen if we decrease the
number of cases, and to do that large gatherings need to be stopped.","Title IX is a very complicated office, but after a bit of research, it appears that its main goal is to report the number of sexual assaults that occur at UCSB. In my opinion, the Title IX office is more concerned about making UCSB appear as a safe school rather than providing a platform for survivors of sexual assault to share their stories. Being sexually assaulted is an extremely traumatic experience and I could not even begin to fathom the toll that would take on one’s mental health. It is already so hard for survivors to come forward and report due to the stigma and fear of backlash. In fact, 99% of sexual assaults go unreported and there are even more barriers to report for students who are part of the BIPOC or LGBTQ+ communities. I believe that UCSB should be more focused on supporting survivors and holding perpetrators accountable rather than maintaining a reputation. I would push for the university to work on addressing and solving this problem of sexual assault - especially at parties - rather than acting like it doesn’t exist. I am very passionate about this issue and would like to work on solutions with organizations while putting pressure on the university to take action.","I believe UCSB has improved in serving historically underrepresented groups over the years, but in my opinion, they are still not doing enough. I don’t believe that they make their institutions that support underrepresented groups, such as the Asian Resource Center (ARC), well known enough. Additionally, they are very quick to show their support in the form of a few emails with colorful graphics after a hateful event occurs, but they don’t take preventative measures before. And in my opinion, the support they offer is very performative, containing little to no active solutions. I first noticed this during the Black Lives Matter movement during quarantine and again, recently, with the increasing Asian hate crimes due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Since I am not a member of the Black community, but I would hope to listen to how these students felt then and now, and how they personally think the school can do a better job of supporting them. The same goes for Indigenous, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ students. There are other problems that need to be addressed such as the hate crimes that occur in Isla Vista that UCSB refuses to address as well as the higher dropout rates for BIPOC students. As a senator, I would advocate for these communities and make sure that the university is actively improving its efforts to support underrepresented groups.","As I mentioned above, if elected to serve on the A.S. Senate, the first bill/resolution I would
hope to author would be related to housing in Isla Vista. It is so incredibly difficult to find
affordable and safe housing close to campus. Oftentimes, if you are able to find a cheaper house
or apartment it may have mold, rust, or other atrocious conditions. Landlords in Isla Vista take
advantage of young college students who need a place to stay by charging thousands of dollars
for a glorified shack. As an off-campus senator, I feel it is my responsibility to advocate for
affordable and safe housing in Isla Vista on behalf of the student body. I would first propose
passing a positional and directional resolution directing the five executive officers of the
Associated Students to lobby and advocate for rent control and a rent cap in Isla Vista to the
County Board of Supervisors. I hope that this would put pressure on the Isla Vista landlords who
are willing to scam students to make some extra money.","Unfortunately, I feel like a majority of students either know nothing about AS or feel that AS has
nothing to do with them. Since this is my first year being a part of AS, I had almost no
knowledge of the institution my first year at UCSB. Had I not applied to be a fellow this year, I
would have never known how much AS does to help the community and how many resources
they have. I think one of the best ways to keep the student body informed is by posting more on
social media about what the AS Senate is working on and why. I believe that increasing social
media presence is necessary because many students don’t go out of their way to research AS
meetings. Putting more of this information on social media would increase awareness and
provide easily accessible, concise information. Beyond posting, I feel that one of the best things
to do is to get more students involved in AS. We can do this by making it more known about the
various introductory positions available in Associated Students through bulk emails that keep
students informed. I found the Pearman Fellowship on Handshake, but not all students utilize
that platform. By promoting positions on social media and through emails, I believe that there
will be more engagement from students and more interest in AS as an entity. On top of that, I
would also hope to make individual changes. I would encourage students to reach out to talk
about my position and how they can get involved. I believe that these changes together can
increase awareness and information for the UCSB student body.","If we return to in-person instruction next year, there is a lot to be done. As a senator, I would
hope to aid this transition by first, making all information well-known and accessible as possible. I would do this by posting information on social media about the latest guidelines/expectations from the CDC, vaccines, and other updates regarding the virus. This information changes constantly so it is important to keep the student body informed. Additionally, since the safety of the student body would be my main priority, I would advocate for students to continue wearing masks in classrooms and to social distance if they are not vaccinated. I would also work towards establishing more sanitation stations and promote handwashing as much as possible to reduce the spread of infection. In addition to safety, I would hope that all students feel welcomed and heard, especially first-year students. The Class of 2024 also had a completely online year so it would be an adjustment for them as well. I would hope to work with members of these classes to see how I can better assist them in adjusting to in-person activity and provide information about all the resources they have access to.","I think that UCSB was very quick to act once they realized how serious a threat COVID 19 was back in the Winter of 2020. They were accommodating with finals and professors were very quick to adjust to an online learning environment for Spring Quarter. However,  there were definitely situations that could have been handled better. The first one that comes to mind is the fact that tuition costs were not substantially lowered despite a majority of students not being on campus. Students were also upset about the university’s lack of transparency regarding tuition costs. I think that the university definitely could have been more understanding about these costs considering the unprecedented circumstances COVID brought about. A.S. had to issue COVID Relief Grants because the university was not acting. Second, as I mentioned above, I believe they also could have better handled violations of public health guidelines (parties) with stricter punishments. Their leniency on the issue has only encouraged more students to participate in these large gatherings. Because of this, COVID cases continue to rise in IV, which is not only unsafe, but also makes it difficult for a transition back onto campus and life to return to normal. Third, I believe that professors need to be more understanding of student situations. After the initial quarter online, professors have been piling on work and refusing to acknowledge that we are still in the midst of a pandemic. Lastly, the university did not comment on anti-Asian sentiment or offer support until recently, despite the fact that this had been going on for much longer. Overall, the university did handle some situations well, but there is much to be improved upon.",,,,,,,
Luisa Ramirez,max,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162848/luisa-ramirez.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,2nd,Global Studies,,,"I am running to be an off-campus senator because I care about my community and I care about
holding the university accountable to serve at the most transparent and equitable ability it can. I
am running because as a first generation, Hispanic, woman I felt I could understand and
empathize with many other students on their own experiences to provide a more enriching
experience at the university. Coming from a low income background, I understand what it means
to navigate in these spaces with a different perspective and how to target issues that affect other
like minded students. One of my main efforts is to provide the vocalization of students’ needs
who feel as though they do not have a voice in what happens at the university. I want to be able
to leave the university in better conditions than how I entered it by creating an equitable
environment for other students to flourish. As a student already involved in some areas of the
university, I wanted to take the next step to be more involved with the university through direct
action. A.S. Senate serves as a perfect stepping stone to advocate for the topics that interest not
only me but other students for the better.","As a first year student, I was a pearman fellow in Associated Students which allowed me to
become involved with a firsthand experience on how different sectors of student government
interact with one another at UCSB. As a second year student, I am currently involved with the
External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office as the Community Service District
Coordinator (CSD). Being the CSD in the EVPLA office has allowed me to attend the bi-weekly
Isla Vista Community Service District Meetings (IVCSD). These meetings have been extremely
beneficial in understanding what happens in Isla Vista and how our community interacts with
neighboring Santa Barbara. As well as giving me new perspectives on how our community can
continually improve, whether it be environmentally or socially. Therefore, I believe in myself to
create a better community through the ability to listen and understand different perspectives of
our community members but ultimately act upon the best outcomes for the community. I am
hoping my skills will initiate positive change in the university and encourage other students to
not only participate but also take part by taking up space and finding positions that suit their
interests as well. My unique experiences in, and out of, the office will bring new perspectives to
different situations I may face, if elected, as off-campus senator.","While in office, I would like to tackle some of my platform initiatives prior to expanding my
efforts, although I am willing and able to act on whatever needs would provide for a more
equitable campus for the students. The first resolution I would like to endorse is California senate
bill 16, as a positional resolution to hold UCPD accountable for previous incidents in recent
years. Some of the issues which have affected our community members negatively in the past
include the conflict with the amount of maskless officers in Isla Vista and many accounts of
minor infractions. With the support of this resolution I would pursue an eventual positional
resolution to call for the defunding of UCPD. Another resolution I would like to introduce would
be a positional resolution to advocate on behalf of students in Isla Vista for their need of safer
housing conditions that are affected by black mold or asbestos in student’s homes. This issue is
important to me because I am running for off-campus senator and one of my greatest concerns is
the safety of students' health which is affected by negative housing concerns. The third resolution
I would like to introduce while in office would be a financial resolution investing AS funds on
already existing resources to better aid students in their mental health and wellbeing or financial
resources for students affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is imperative that students feel
comfortable and are prepared for the return to campus whether it be through financial relief or
mental health resources to create a safer and comfortable transition to in person classes.","My platforms include, but are not limited to, reducing law enforcement in the surrounding areas of Isla Vista, advocating for the reduction of minor infractions for our community members, publicizing student fees and recaps of senate meetings, preserving safe spaces for marginalized students, and advocating for the best interest of off campus students. Ways in which I plan to execute the reduction of law enforcement is through the increased support of external outlets not often thought of when there is an infraction such as mental health resources or social services experts. I also plan on advocating for community reliance and wellness checks instead of law enforcement. As for publicizing student fees and recaps of senate meetings, I would advocate for the meetings to be formatted in an easily accessible manner and be posted somewhere students could easily find to provide for more transparency from the senate. Currently, meetings are open to students but may often be difficult to navigate if they are not already involved in AS. Advocating safe spaces for students is extremely important to my platforms because with the transition from virtual learning to physical spaces, students may have trouble navigating a campus they have been away from or never stepped foot in. If elected I would continue to listen to my peers and access their needs to navigate their housing concerns.","I hope to work with marginalized communities and organizations to serve the students who are often overlooked best. Some groups I personally hope to help promote and work closely with include, Mujeres Unidas por Justicia, Educacion y Revolucion (MUJER), Survivors of Sexual Assault (SASA), Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), and Gauchos 4 Transparency (G4T). Many of these organizations I have personally been following since my first year at UCSB and I am always encouraged and amazed by all the amazing work these organizations provide for the students. IVTU is one of the organizations I plan on working with heavily to allow for their input on what students need or are being voiced to through their organization. G4T is also another organization that I have seen grow from the very beginning of their creation last year and have been extremely astounded by all the hard work they put in to provide and voice transparency for our peers. Their coverage of multiple different organizations and accessible platforms have been inspiring to observe. I hope to work closely with G4T to allow for the same accountability and transparency as they provide because I am truly inspired by their efforts. MUJER and SASA are also two other organizations I have been closely following and am incredibly motivated by their distinct efforts to allow for student growth and safety. MUJER is an organization that I hope to work with due to their focus on justice and education. I also hope to work with SASA to destigmatize receiving help with sexual assault on our campus. I also hope working with SASA would allow for marginalized students to feel they are not alone in their journey to taking up space on our campus by receiving the help from organizations they can trust. Overall, these organizations are all wonderful in their unique approach to allowing students transparency and equity on our campus.","If remote instruction continues in the 2021-2022 school year I plan on creating and advertising multiple different social media outlets and creating widely publicized zoom meeting office hours to be easily accessible to students. I would promote a separate social media exclusively for my off campus senator position and publicize all of the platforms and organizations I support. Additionally, I would be extremely flexible with managing my personal zoom meetings if my traditional hours result in a conflict with the student’s own. I understand and empathize with everyone struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic and believe that everyone deserves kindness when dealing with multiple different tasks. This is one of the reasons why I would not mind creating different accessible platforms, if I were to serve it would be for the people at accessible times for them. The last thing I would ever want to do is create limited hours to deny someone access to knowledge they have every right to question and learn. If I ever do not have a sufficient answer for my constituent, I would do my best to contact someone who knows the subject in greater depth than I do or I would find the answer myself as quickly as I can to relay the
information.","I believe I am the best candidate for Off Campus senator because I am approachable and have had experience with the community through my attendance of IVCSD meetings. I have learned many invaluable skills on the proper way to address community concerns and am actively working on sharing any information that may benefit our community members. As the current CSD in the EVPLA office, I have gained a greater understanding of how to deal with the different perspectives from our residents in Isla Vista and the multiple projects that benefit them. I am always eager to learn about different programs and opportunities that benefit our community members and provide other students with my information. I already know how to manage zoom office hours and am eager to respond to any questions on my position or regarding the office I am involved in. I am also extremely friendly and willing to help other students with any questions or concerns they may have. I believe my prior experience as a Pearman fellow and being a liaison in an AS space I can manage the extensive tasks being an off campus senator may hold. As an intersectional and marginalized student I offer different perspectives that will aid senate meetings by offering a new perspective to issues that other students also face.",Left-leaning,Excellent: I believe the 72nd Senate did the best they could under the circumstances and I applaud their actions on acting as swiftly as possible to provide the assistance necessary for all students. I understand the unique circumstances held various struggles in their own ways and the Senate acted as best they could. An example of addressing student needs was displayed through quarterly Covid Relief Grants.,"Yes: I am in favor of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement because I am against human rights violations. As a global citizen and human rights activist I do not support acts of violence.","Yes: I believe that tuition should be free because an increase in education always benefits the community and state that allows it. In fact, California has already attempted the possibility of paid tuition through the $48 fix plan of 2017 and counties such as Riverside county offer free tuition for community college students.","I believe the mental health services at UCSB do address many needs of students, although there are some areas that could be improved. One of the biggest concerns I often find permeating social media from other students is the need for more mental health counselors. I also find students commentary on long wait times to receive any type of assistance or guidance to be one of the most popular issues students face. Something that could be done would be the increased amount of university funding for mental health services on campus to create less barriers for students who face long wait times and the possibility of not receiving the assistance they need. From the short research of accessing the UCSB CAPS website, it is noted that a two week minimum wait time is the average for students to receive any assistance for their mental health and wellness, I would advocate for more assistance so CAPS and similar services could get back to students in a shorter amount of time. CARE is another source for mental health services students praise often the only issue is the lack of funding it receives. I would strongly advocate for increased funding in CARE and CAPS to better suit the needs of students.","I believe the response to partying in Isla Vista could have definitely been handled better by the
university and Greek life. The university should have made clear protocols and have better
handled the media coverage putting the university in a negative light. Members of Greek life
who participated in partying were a danger to the health and wellness of the families and
community members of Isla Vista. The university should have acted faster and taken more
precautions on the parties in Isla Vista. There should have been more punitive measures to assure
our residents safety such as monetary fines or suspension on the universities behalf. One of the
most vocal concerns by students online was the lack of accountability the university took
compared to the amount of efforts in recent years to limit the partying of Halloween and
Deltopia. The county did address accountability by enforcing monetary fines but these only
rolled out very recently, at around the end of fall quarter in 2020, yet the amount of recorded
party incidents were apparent very early on at the end of the 2019 school year. Additionally, the
amount of fines issued are far less than the amount of reported incidents took place. The
university should have acted quicker to protect its students' health.","With the knowledge I have, the university’s Title IX office serves mainly as a statistical reporting of sexual assault on our campus. I understand why it is an important resource, but students often feel quantified by these spaces rather than aided in mental health resources for them. While I do believe spaces such as Title IX should be less stigmatized on our campus, not all students feel comfortable in this space. Marginalized students often feel scrutinized in these spaces and benefit from the resources on campus such as CARE. Entities on campus such as this should be endorsed by the university to become less stigmatized and be more accessible for all students who are survivors. I would advocate for more funding from AS to improve the resources already available that already help students facing these struggles on our campus. I believe the university has so many different ways to address sexual assault on campus, yet there seems to be a lack of accountability when the topic comes up. The university could promote solidarity with survivors on campus through emails, posts, formal legislation on maintaining a safe campus, yet there seems to be a lack of accountability. Additionally, there could be formal trainings mandatory for all students at UCSB to attend to promote the safety of others on what is deemed sexual assault and what resources are available if a student has undergone an incident. These simple yet impactful mandatory courses would help ease the difficult journey of addressing what sexual assault is and how to navigate the spaces necessary for help. These courses would also decrease
stigma on how survivors navigate the university to gain the help necessary to deal with their
unique circumstance.","I believe UCSB is currently serving historically underrepresented groups, although I find there is
always room for improvement. Many notable commissions on campus serve as amazing
resources for marginalized students but they often lack funding to provide even more financial or
social support students would benefit from. If elected, I would advocate for the investment of
financial resources to grant aid for these commissions and boards to increase their budgets to
help even more students who either have not heard or used the resources available to them
because of a lack of understanding of how to navigate these spaces. One of my platforms focuses
on increasing the visibility of marginalized spaces to provide for a safer environment once the
return to on campus learning becomes available. As a marginalized student who has often used
some of the resources on campus I am pleased at the different resources available, but I am also
aware of different places or organizations that would benefit from receiving more funding or
visibility to reach a wider audience.","If elected to serve on the A.S. Senate I would plan to author a resolution advocating for my
platform goals first. The first resolution would be an endorsement of California senate bill 16, as
a positional resolution to hold UCPD accountable and allow for full transparency to the student
body. One of the concerns I began noticing in Isla Vista was the students not being comfortable
or able to voice their concerns in front of law enforcement. Many marginalized communities
have negative experiences with law enforcement and do not feel safe around officers on campus.
The resolution I plan to author would be a stepping stone to remove, gradually, officers from the
university’s campus to allow for students to feel more comfortable on campus. With this
resolution I envision a safer and more accessible campus where our diverse communities of
students can begin to work in a safer environment. One of the biggest concerns for students in
the past year has been officers in Isla Vista working without masks essentially not following the
state mandates. One of the other concerns students have had is the amount of minor infractions
students receive on campus, which I would also advocate for reducing on our campus.","As a senator, one of the main components I would strive for is the accessibility of Associated
Students. I would promote my office hours on social media and keep my social media open to
communication for students to reach me whenever or however they feel most comfortable. I
would also promote the engagement and active participation in senate meetings. One of my
platforms emphasizes the transparency of senate meetings and accessibility for students who are
not involved with Associated Students. I would consistently endorse different organizations on
multiple platforms to demonstrate various resources for students to use and benefit from. I would
also allow students to set meetings up individually with me if my office hours do not meet their
time constraints. Associated Students can often seem like a large and daunting organization and
especially with all the new students who will be stepping on campus for the first time, different
organizations can seem confusing and difficult to navigate. I would advocate for students to ask
questions with me and other senators to help guide them back to on campus learning. I would
definitely endorse AS to send weekly recaps in the forms of newsletters for students to access or
provide graphics on social media to allow for transparency. Different forms of communication
that are not currently found or accessible would allow for a broader audience of students to
receive information they otherwise would not have received. Often, many students only know
AS from one niche and are not aware of the various other resources available. I would like to
change that for the constituents of the university.","As a senator I would do my best to present graphics to promote safe practices to encourage students health and wellness. I would promote the usage of masks in large classroom settings, with or without a California mandate, due to the effectiveness of mask usage. I would also promote hand washing and hand sanitizing to prevent the spread of infections on campus. I would advocate for an increased hand sanitizing stations and encourage students to continue safe practices . I would also advocate for an increase in Covid relief grants for students struggling with unique circumstances perpetuated or personified by the pandemic. I believe the transition to off campus and off campus housing from both previously enrolled students and new students will be a difficult transition in terms of navigating the campus. I would like to be able to ease this difficult transition by promoting different resources and increasing awareness to all the organizations that serve students to help them become more comfortable on campus. I would also advocate for food security and mental health resources for the students new to on or off campus housing. Many of these resources would significantly reduce the stress of returning to campus. In addition I would promote my office hours to personally help students who need extra assistance or would like to have me guide them through different organizations as a support system to encourage them and make them feel more comfortable with a peer.","The university failed in providing transparency in where the tuition of our students was being
distributed to. Many students were vocally upset and demanding a reduction of their tuition from
the university on various social media platforms. I understand that many university workers were
still operating on campus in different sectors to keep the university well maintained throughout
the vacancy, but I cannot account for the rest of the funding as it was not transparent or discussed
in a system wide email. A system wide email discussing the relocation of the funding would
have been a small step in transparency but the university did not decide to act on this idea or
other similar forms of demonstrating graphics. I empathize with the students who were
incredibly disheartened by the lack of vocalization of their tuition funds and who struggled with
the transition to virtual learning. The university was successful in its ability to provide Covid
relief grants and technology grants to aid students in the virtual transition. Although these grants
were extremely beneficial, many students still faced an increasing uncertainty in their new
realities at home and online. Virtual learning was also not monitored by the university and held
varying challenges depending on the course taken by students. Many students were vocal about
the lack of majors at UCSB joining other universities in allowing for pass, no pass classes due to
the difficulties presented for each student's new reality. Overall, I do believe that the university
handled many different aspects of the pandemic well since it was an extremely rare
circumstance, but there were many different opportunities to act on injustices that negatively
affected the students the university is supposed to serve.",,,,,,,

happier campus. As a transfer student from UCSD, I have seen multiple perspectives involving
the UC system. The problems at UCSD seem to be present at UCSB as well. Because of these
issues I’ve seen, I want to make a change to create a better university experience for everyone. I
want to make sure people feel safe off campus and everyone is provided with the resources to
feel safe. I also plan to provide resources for people’s mental health while attending university.
Mental health is often pushed under the rug and I want to make sure it is a topic of discussion. I
also hope to provide affordable housing to those who come from lower income families or who
are struggling to make enough money to survive. Lastly, I want to continue to prioritize
COVID-19 and make sure everyone is getting the vaccine. I am very passionate about creating
change at this university. I have struggled with feeling safe and secure within Isla Vista. And
while college can be a great experience, it can often be lonely and take a toll on people’s mental
health. My hope is to create a healthier, safer environment for the entire community.","I am currently Vice President of the Sociology Association. I created this association due to the
lack of opportunities for undergraduates within the sociology department. I wanted to make a
community of sociology majors where we can discuss career opportunities, find internship and
research opportunities, and learn more about grad school. The association has become a hit and
we have so many people interested in joining! This association has proved to me that I can do
whatever I put my mind to. I am not afraid of putting myself out there, even if it seems to be a
far-fetched task at hand. I consider myself to be a leader and I enjoy taking on leadership roles
for issues I am passionate about. Furthermore, I am in Gamma Phi Beta. This sorority has
become a home to me. Every single girl is so unique and offers something new to the chapter. If I
need anything, I know I can count on them to help me. This sorority has become my rock and
has prepared me to become a senator because all of these amazing women push me to the best
version of myself that I can be. I have become a more confident role model to those around me
and I am not afraid to fight for what I believe in.","The first resolution I would like to introduce while in office is advocating for safety by working
with Campus Safety in order to provide 24 hour services for students. If anyone is walking home
and feels unsafe, they can call this number and the people can stay on the phone with them while
they walk home or can come pick them up if needed. I think this needs to be implemented ASAP
due to the upsetting amount of sexual assaults and harassment that have occured in this
university. Next, I would like to work with the AS Commission on Student Well-Being to
increase mental-health awareness by providing yoga and meditation courses for students. My
hope is that these courses will provide a safe space for students to focus and let go of the issues
that have been upsetting them. Furthermore, I want to spread the resources available for those
struggling with their mental-health. While these need some work, we do have some amazing
resources present and I think they need to become more well-known. My last resolution I would
introduce involves establishing a connection with the Affordable Housing unit of Santa Barbara
county. I know many students cannot afford the current cost of living because of the outrageous
prices. I hope to alleviate this burden by providing affordable housing to those who need it.","The first resolution I would like to introduce while in office is advocating for safety by working

With their help I hope to implement the 24 hour call services and hand out keychain alarms to all UCSB students. I would also like to work with the Isla Vista Tenants Union to ensure that they work to get rid of popcorn ceilings that can contain asbestos and be harmful to student’s health. I hope that will be cooperative in helping me obtain this goal and help me work with the Affordable Housing unit of SB county in order to obtain housing for low-income families. All of the housing in IV and SB is outrageously costly and something should be done to mitigate the stress it causes many individuals. Furthermore, I plan to work with the AS Commission on Well-Being to increase the resources available for those struggling with their mental health. I have read up on what the ASCWB works to do and they are truly working to provide everyone a healthy experience. I plan to work with Student Health as COVID-19 comes to an end. I hope we can work to get everyone vaccinated and healthy so school can begin to reopen.","I will make myself available to everyone no matter the circumstances next year. I plan to hold office hours weekly for those who would like to come and talk with me. If people cannot make my office hours, I plan to have appointments available for everyone to come talk with me. I want to make it a safe place for people to come talk to me and help them in any possible way that I can. I want to make sure everyone’s voices are heard and allow everyone who wants to talk to me the space to do so.

I have witnessed the issues of safety,
housing problems, and mental health issues that the universities have failed to acknowledge. I have also had my own share of problems with my mental health declining, and I was not aware of where to go to get help. Or, I felt very unsafe a few times walking home late at night from a class and I didn’t know what to do or who to call. The housing situation is also not ideal for many individuals and I have lived in super cramped, tight quarter my freshman year because they accepted more students than they had housing available for. I was forced to live in a triple that was made to be a double. Because of these issues I have personally experienced, I plan to create a safer environment for everyone here living in Isla Vista. I am a determined, preserving, and strong individual who is willing to go the extra mile to create this change within the university. I will do whatever it takes to make sure people feel safe, happy, and welcomed in their community.",Left-leaning,"Very Good: I believe that with the present circumstances at hand the 72nd A.S. Senate to the best they could to address the needs to students during the COVID-19 pandemic. While they were not completely prepared, they adjusted as well as they could to provide online accessibility for students' needs.","No answer: I do not believe I am currently educated enough on the matter to provide my input. However, I plan to learn more about this resolution in the future and see what the best way to handle this movement would be.","Yes: I believe UCSB should be tuition-free. Everyone should be entitled to an education and with the current cost of attendance, many are not able to afford it. If all colleges and universities became tuition-free, we could provide education to everyone. If we have more educated individuals within our society, the world would become a better, brighter place.","I believe that the mental health services at UCSB are really good, however, people do not know about them. Mental health resources should be more well-known and one way to do that is to advertise them more often and consistently. Due to the transition to online schooling, the university has not done a good job reminding students of the resources available to them. I believe there should be a tab on GOLD that provides information about these resources so students can access them anywhere and anytime. Also, students will then be reminded of these resources on a daily basis. The constant reminder should help students realize that they can reach out to those resources and look into it on their own time. Because mental health issues still have a negative stigma surrounding them, I believe that allowing people to do their own research will have many more people utilizing the resources. Of course, there needs to also be a shift towards normalizing talking about mental health as well, and maybe letting individuals approach this subject themselves and become comfortable with it will create a more positive stigma. I also plan to work with CAPS and the AS Commission on Student Well-Being to make these ideas a reality.","I believe that the university could have handled the partying allegations better at the beginning of
the pandemic. From my understanding, there were many parties going on and nothing was being
done to stop it. This was putting many people’s lives at risk because of how easily they could
spread it to other people living in IV. Unfortunately, this is still an ongoing issue and was seen
during Deltopia this past weekend when a bunch of people were partying. We all need to abide
by CDC guidelines if we ever want the pandemic to come to a stop. Furthermore, I do believe the
sororities and fraternities should be fined for their partying. I am currently part of Gamma Phi
Beta and while I love my sorority, I am aware of the ongoing problems currently present within
Greek Life due to the partying. If people from a sorority or fraternity are seen partying, I think
that their chapter should be fined or the individuals should be put on academic probation. The
fraternities and sororities who continue to party during this pandemic are continuing to give
Greek Life a bad reputation, which is not fair to the chapters who are abiding by CDC
guidelines.","I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its functions. Due to the COVID-19
pandemic, they are currently only responding to individuals through email. I do not think this is adequate in addressing the needs of sexual assault suriviors. Unfortunately, I know a few individuals who have been sexually assaulted, and I do not think the office has done a good
enough job in addressing the needs and concerns of the survivors. For example, during the
pandemic, they have failed to be on top of their cases. Pandemic or not, sexual assault surviors deserve a fair trial and their needs met immediately after the incident. Some people’s needs, however, are not being met until months after the incident and the attacker is allowed to walk freely and maybe even continue assaulting others who are too afraid to speak up. It is such a scary thing to go through, and those survivors should feel that telling their side of the story is not going to cause harm to them. Something needs to be done to mitigate the process of filing a sexual assault report because it is too draining on the survivors who have already been through too much.","I believe UCSB has done an okay job at effectively serving historically underrepresented groups,
however, there is a lot of room for improvement. I believe that there should be more resources
and organizations available to members of the Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+
communities. They need to be more represented throughout the school. For example, having
more underrepresented groups voices heard in the AS Senate would provide a great opportunity
for representation. This should be a top priority because these groups need to be heard and
represented throughout the university. Furthermore, with online learning, I feel it is even harder
to find a place within the community currently. There should be resources available online to
those who are underrepresented. The more resources available to those underrepresented groups,
the more included they will begin to feel. At UCSD, for example, they had many resource
centers available for many underrepresented groups such as the LGBTQ+ and Black
communities. I believe more of those should be implemented on and off campus for
underrepresented groups to feel more comfortable and welcomed. If I become one of the
Off-Campus Senators, I plan to make underrepresented groups a priority and give them the
resources they need to feel welcome within our community. I will work with each group because
all groups deserve their voices to be heard.","The first resolution I plan to author is implementing the 24 hour on duty staff within Campus
Safety. People should feel safe in their own community and safety for me is my number one
priority. I want every member of UCSB to feel safe. No one should feel scared walking home by
themselves or feel the need to hold their keys up to their chest in fear someone will attack them.
Because of this, I want to provide these 24 hour call services. They should be used anytime
anyone feels unsafe, whether they are walking home late at night, during the day, etc. It does not
matter. These are to be used anytime anyone needs them. Someone will stay on the phone with
you during this walk home and if anything is to happen, they can call 911 for you. If you feel too
unsafe to walk, they will come give you a ride back to your apartment. Due to the upsetting
amount of sexual assaults and harassment this campus has seen, there needs to be something
done to mitigate the issues at hand. I also plan to make keychain alarms accessible to every
UCSB student. These alarms will serve as a way to alert any nearby person if you are being
attacked. Something needs to be done about the ongoing safety issues in IV.","As a Senator, I would work to involve the student body more and keep them informed by
allowing them to come talk with me whenever they would like to! For those who want to be
involved and have ideas they would like to share with me, I will give them my email address and
we can also set up zoom meetings, one-on-one appointments, and more. Whatever form of
communication works best for everyone is the one I am willing to do. I also plan to post things
on social media to tell the student body what is happening within the Senate. It is my job as a
senator to inform the student body of the issues we are planning to address. I want to make sure I
am accessible to all students because they are the reason I am running to be a senator.
Communication is so important and needs to be available to all students. I want to give all
students an opportunity to allow their voices to be heard. My goal is to form a connection with
my students because they have needs of their own that need to be addressed. I am very adamant
on forming connections with my students to address their needs, wants, and concerns as best as I
can.","This transition is not going to be an easy one. I plan to help aid the transition back to in-person instruction and in-person activity in Isla Vista by first making sure the ability to become vaccinated is accessible to all students. Once we get the majority of the students vaccinated, many people should feel more comfortable and safe participating in in-person classes and in-person activities present within the IV community. I want to also make sure everyone is educated about the vaccine. The people who are unsure of receiving it are often the ones who do not know enough about the vaccine to make a valid decision. My next step of action would be to see who feels comfortable going back to in-person classes and communities, and who does not. For those who do, I hope to make the transition as smooth as possible by providing the resources necessary to do so. For those who still want to stay online, I plan to make sure they are allowed to do so and are provided the same amount of resources as those who go back in person. I want everyone to feel comfortable and safe as we begin to transition back to in-person. It is not going to be easy, but I will try and make it as smooth and seamless as possible.","The university failed in handling the COVID-19 pandemic and remote learning by not telling the
students about what was going on. The transition online was a mess, which would have been
okay had they communicated with the students. The professors didn’t know what to do, so I feel
like we lost a quarter while we began to transfer to remote learning. Not to mention, they should
have been more lenient with the transition as it was such a shock for everyone. Some people
didn’t have a place to go and were unsure of what was going to happen next. Because of this,
they should have allowed students to drop classes if needed without any repercussions. They also
tried to continue implementing synchronous classes online which was not feasible considering
the differing circumstances for every single student attending the university. The university
succeeded in handling the COVID-19 pandemic by creating asynchronous classes. These classes
allowed for the utmost flexibility for students who have work and other commitments that
conflict with their class schedules. I hope the university will continue to offer some of these
asynchronous classes for years to come as they are extremely reasonable and helpful for students
who might need to go home, have work at the time of their classes, and do better with online
learning.",,,,,,,

created an extra layer of stress that fell upon students. I hope to untangle this chaos by making
local advocacy a priority in order to ease the stress that comes with off-campus living. Coming
in as a first year, I was denied access to campus housing which was offered on a differential
basis. Like everyone else, I had to learn to adapt to constant unpredictability. Similarly, as a
woman and child of immigrants the variability in how I’m recieved has been constant. Fulfilling
this role and representing my community is the best opportunity for me to amplify marginalized
voices that deserve to be heard.","I started at UCSB in the middle of the pandemic and internalized a lot of the uncertainty that
followed. I’ve tried getting involved by joining different clubs like CalPirg and the Persian
Student Group as well as the Engaging Humanities program. But I still felt stuck until I found
this opportunity with the Isla Vista Party to channel my mix of frustration and inspiration into
action. This senate position would allow me to apply my urge for advocacy at a level where we
can all see change materialize--ultimately to serve you as a constituent and our community as a
whole. I hope to lend my skills, existing connections, and evergrowing capabilities to connect
AS to established initiatives in need of support. Organizing collective action to make AS more
inclusive and representative of the student population and its off-campus constituents is critical
in my eyes.","- Positional resolution denouncing the heavy policing and racial profiling in IV
- Resolution directing the association to coordinate with IV foot patrol and UCPD to maintain
oversight over these entities and to work towards eliminating implicit baises
-A positional resolution to advocate on behalf of students of Isla Vista and their need for safer
housing conditions black mold and asbestos","As students, if we don’t have our basic needs guaranteed, it’s going to be difficult to realize our true potential. As your off-campus senator I hope to tackle the toxic mold in off campus housing and advocate for livable rent prices. I also hope to work to reduce policing and amplify underrepresented voices in IV. That’s why in addition, I want to make CAPS (counseling and psychological services) more accessible. This includes working with survivors to foster a physically and emotionally safe atmosphere at UCSB and creating a panel geared towards specificity. My platform is as follows:
To eliminate the normalized toxic mold issue in off-campus housing by collaborating with the EVPLA (external vice president for local affairs) office. To advocate for livable rent prices across the board and hold property managers accountable for taking advantage of students To amplify underrepresented voices by holding regular forums and opportunities for community members to get involved. To reduce policing in IV and the threat/fear that accompanies heavily policed minor infractions. To expand accessibility to CAPS (counseling and psychological services) to ensure students’ basic needs are met. To create a safe atmosphere, both physically and emotionally, by fostering an environment that prioritizes working with survivors.","I hope to collaborate with the EVPLA office and Isla Vista Tenants Union for housing related issues. Eliminating toxic mold and asbestos will be a priority as well as reinstating balanced tenant-landlord relationships that have a legal stronghold advocating for students. To amplify underrepresented voices and advocate for survivors I will be utilizing CAPS and CARE. Paired with the AS Student Commission on Racial Equality and the AS Legal Resource Center will be an ideal outlet for expanding student representation for minorities and underrepresented community members. Working with these recognized organizations and initiatives will ensure that with AS support, funding, and resource allocation that impactful change can be observed at a local level.","I plan to hold virtual office hours via zoom as well as posting updates and maintaining open digital channels for conversations. I really want to hold a space for people to voice their concerns and be active constituents because your demands deserve to be heard. While transitioning back to an in person state of school functioning, hopefully I’ll be avialble in a public space for discusison. Outdoor, socially distanced opportunities for conversation will certainly be applicable in this sense.","As an individual I am someone who is verbal and communicative of issues. At the same time, my empathetic nature makes it so my independent drive translates to public service causes. I hold a transformative vision as a leader and harness my emotional cognizance to make change happen. Living off campus as a freshman during this unique time period has opened my eyes to the mutlitde of issues and the university’s shortcomings that have become unveiled.",Left-leaning,Very Good: They have held effective meetings and helped advocate for students immensely during this period of transformative change in the way our campus and student body has been forced to function. But there’s still room to improve by promoting inclusivity and ensuring open channels of communication for constituents to get involved.,Yes: We need to put our money where our mouth is when it comes to being responsible global citizens. Divesting from these companies is a vital next step to harness the collective power that lies in a boycott.,"Yes: Ideally all UC campuses can transition towards a model such as this, but in this current climate it makes the most sense to maintain tuition but provide online school options that would be paired with a tuition reduction for the reduction in quality of education during this time. 48 dollar fix was almost achieved in California and some cities such as San Fransisco has begun enacting this tuition free model UCSB should strive towards.","The existence of mental health services is not effective in itself. Outreach programs need to be restructured in order to aid students constructively. I hope to increase access to CAPS by expanding its range of therapists available and improving the outreach program that would make it easier for people to seek help. In addition, expanding CARE and student involvement within similar programs to allow for a demand for such investment of services.","Fines and penalties that were promoted during this time ultimately failed as a deterrent for
students breaking social distancing protocols. Organizaitons backing these events should face
consequences but the root cause of the issue is the lack of individuals’ intrinsic motivation to
keep the community safe. A collective effort is necessary to overcome this, which is why an
organized call to action to vaccinate students as soon as possible is going to be necessary moving
forward. Before we know it, we’re going to be transitioning into a post-covid world and
understanding how to navigate it is going to be critical.",The university must hold perpetrators accountable for their actions whether that means pushing for disciplinary action or removing them from whatever position they hold. I stand with survivors and want to ensure there’s a community of advocates providing resources and a safe space to be heard. Title IX is there to quantify statistics and showcase the school’s response to sexual assault. Consequently it means underreporting and supression of those who come forward. The university needs to actively stand up for survivors and enact consequences for perpetrators. .,"I think UCSB is beginning to acknowledge its shortcomings and problematic history in this area
which is a sign of progress but there is still a long way to go from here. Greater intersectional
representation and more leadership positions held by BIPOC and LGBTQ+ community members
will in turn validate the traditionally marginalized and historically underrepresented groups seen
at the university and societal levels.","A positional resolution to advocate on behalf of students of Isla Vista and their need for safer
housing conditions black mold and asbestos will be my first course of action.
I hope to work with my constituents and fellow senators to author this resolution and restore a
healthy balance to landlord-tenant dynamics. It’s worth recognizing that in order to ensure
protection from rent spikes and liabilities such as mold, property management companies have
manipulated the housing circumstances of students for too long and action must be taken.","Regular updates on social media and across various platforms are necessary to keep students
informed. I would utilize Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and website based outlets and even
journalistic avenues to ensure every student has the ability to know what is happening in the
Senate. In addition, promoting involvement for the different committees and groups that are
affiliated with A.S. will be critical to target people’s specific interests and concerns.","To aid the transition back to in-person activity, advocating at the university level to supply
financial and academic security is paramount. Just aseverything was shaken up at the start of the pandemic, the upcoming shift to our new ‘normal’ is going to take a great deal of effort and foresight. Nevertheless, I am prepared to take on this task. My creativity and open-mindedness are helpful traits for this unique situation where we must be receptive to various courses of action to get us from one point to another.","The university failed in priotizing the needs of undergraduate students while simultaneously
stripping graduate stuednts of their gaurdenteed source of income. TAs and graduate students
were visibly exploited during this online school. And undergraduates were immensely
underserved. The lack of steady off-campus housing options is a big issue that was illuminated
by the pandemic which was worsened by the large gatherings that were largerly ignored.",,,,,,,

However, we have
to realize, Isla Vista has always been recognized as a party location, so not too excessive fines to

I will also construct a virtual platform (like a website) for students to digitally post their opinions on bills

tangible change among the UCSB community. Seeing the response of the COVID-19
pandemic, I have realized the ways it had affected those who had lived in University
Housing. Being one of those students who hasn’t seen campus in over a year I
realized that once everything returns to normal, there needs to be action taken to
create a safer environment following the COVID-19 pandemic.","During my course at UCSB I have participated with numerous on campus projects
that I believe prepared me for the senator position. My first year I was the
recognition chair of the San Miguel Residence Hall Council. This position
introduced me to the National Residence Hall Honorary which takes pride in
making the living of students in residence halls much easier. My second year I was a
part of the Residential Housing Association as the San Miguel Representative at
Large. This position introduced me to procedures that reign similarities to that of
Associated Students. This year I am one of the Directors of Student Life and
Campus Communication for the Office of the Student Advocate General as well as a
Student Representative for the Pardall Center.",One resolution/ bill I would like to introduce to the Senate is to create a permanent senate liaison seat for the Student Apartment Community Council. I believe creating a bridge between this group and Associated Students allows for there to be more communication and allows for future senators and myself to assess issues pertaining to these students directly. Another resolution/bill I would introduce would to address university owned housing in the scenario of another quarter of remote instruction or even hybrid instruction. This resolution/bill would assess the needs of student housing to open more spots for housing in the residence halls rather than just the university apartments. A third resolution/ bill I would bring up is to provide free menstrual products in all university owned housing. This allows for there to be more accessibility for such resources in public spaces and living quarters.,One part of my platform focuses on creating greater communication between residents and Associated Students. Being that residents of the University Owned Apartments are my main audience I would immediately focus on creating a bridge between the community who lives in the apartments. Associated Students in order to assess any needs these residents have. Another platform that I would like to focus on is providing more on campus resources to the University apartments and making those that already exist become more accessible to residents. Another platform I would like to address is the solidarity for Resident Assistants and the addressing of the cancelled contracts due to the Covid-19 pandemic before fall quarter had begun.,"In order to provide the communication between residents and Associated Students, I would contact the Student Apartment Community Council as well as the Residential Housing Association to properly communicate with the representatives of the students living in university housing. This type of communication allows for there to be direct action to be taken in order for the Senate to address any resolution/bills that need to be written in regards to residents. Speaking of the Residential Housing Association, once more residents start living in housing again, I would collaborate with them to extend their Period Pantry to the University apartments in order to keep a resource such as menstrual products accessible. In order to represent Resident Assistants voices in Associated Students I will personally reach out to Resident Assistants in order to see the needs of them and properly represent them.","I will make myself available to my constituents during the term by allowing for there to be an open door policy through my email and social media. This position differs from others in the
Senate as there is only one University Owned Senator so there is no other person who these
constituents can go to if they need someone for this position. Social Media is the main form of communication during this election season and I will make it a point if remote instruction
continues that I will try my hardest to remain active on these modes of communication in case one needs anything from me. I will also advertise my office hours on social media in order to provide a solid and set time for any students to meet with me and also stress that I can be available outside those hours if need be.","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I have the experience of being a representative for students' needs in a larger setting. Being a part of RHA allowed me to experience what it means to amplify students' voices to larger organizations and bring tangible change for the students. My experience in resident based organizations extends my knowledge of what actions need to be taken in order to create any change as well as know where to look to garner students' voices. In my time at UCSB I have developed a passion for creating a safer, much healthier environment for residents and will make it my mission to do so if elected.",Left-leaning ,Very Good: I believe that I am able to provide above average work for the 73rd Senate as I do have the capabilities and experience to do so. I do wish to dedicate a large amount of my time to the senate if elected in order to try my hardest in this position.,"Yes: Seeing that we are the only ASUC that has not passed a
resolution to divest shows how there needs to have change happen in this area. Though there are
arguments from both sides, I do see more ways why UCSB should divest from these companies
as this year's long conversation has done more harm than good among our community.","No: Though I do vouch for the decrease for tuition, making the school
tuition free would make it more difficult for organizations that are run by student fees to stay
afloat.",,"I believe that the response of the constant gatherings by Greek Life in the midst of a pandemic could have been handled much better because of how deadly COVID-19 truly is. Seeing how students put it into their own hands to call out many of those breaking social distancing only presents how the response could have been better. I believe that fines and harsher punishments
should have been given for the risk of lives.","I am slightly familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its functions, mainly with basic information. Through word of mouth I believe there can be more done to have solidarity and accessibility to survivors. Taking the reports of sexual assault more seriously and providing more resources to different parts of Isla Vista and to housing can be a start
to make reporting and support much easier to survivors.","I do think that the school can do better in serving historically underrepresented groups. Though the school has been making an effort in creating resources in order to help such groups, I believe such resources can grow and blossom to serve underrepresented groups. Being Latina myself, I can see how there can be more done to help students such as myself in order to ensure success and safety on campus.",The first bill/ resolution I wish to author is to create a permanent senate liaison position on the Student Apartment Community Council. This permanent senate liaison position allows for there to be greater communication to be had between AS and residents of the University apartments.,"The use of social media is a greater force than people realize nowadays. Creating a senator page for myself on multiple platforms and posting the bills/resolutions that are passed within senate will allow for there to be greater communication between the student body at large and
Associated Students. This form of transparency allows for those students interested in knowing what is happening within Associated Students and are able to always be able to access it since it will be open to the public.","In my role as a senator, I will try to pass resolutions that I or any other senator authors in the aid of transitions to in person instruction. I will also sense what actions need to be done on my end in order to help other students in what needs to be done. In terms of Isla Vista, I will try to collaborate with other senators to assess the needs of students and try to be more involved in such actions.","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented numerous students with uncertainty of the future of their academic career. Numerous students have also taken on responsibilities that they wouldn’t have when on campus, such as those of familial and work related. I believe that because of this the university could have handled the decrease of student fees much better
since a majority of students could have used such money for emergency services and for their own savings during this time. The university could have also handled the cancelling of Resident Assistant contracts much better as well, since a majority of these students had lost their source of housing and income for the year in such a short amount of time with no compensation for their time.",,,,,,,

Because I am running for a collegiate senate position for the Letters & Science college, I am aware of how large my constituency is, and what that means regarding being a voice for students who do not feel heard. To me, this means considering resolutions and bills that will expand resources available that while they might not pertain to me specifically, could help other students at UCSB in ways that I will never need. For example, one of the main reasons I would like to run to be a senator would be to ensure the diversification of CAPs therapists and practitioners on campus, which will help cultivate a safe space for students in the LGBTQ+ community, and other historically underrepresented groups, such as students who are Black, Latinx, Asian American, Indigenous, etc. Understanding how intersectionality plays a role in the identity of students on campus is also something of high value to me and my platform. This can be seen in other aspects of my platform as well, as I hope to work to systematically eliminate the gender and racial prejudice in classrooms by creating mandatory workshops for TA’s and professors to deconstruct their implicit biases. Furthermore, I am running to be an L&S senator for this year's race because I believe that collegiate senators should be present for issues concerning the academic senate, functioning as a voice for the students they represent. I believe that my platform showcases a high priority for increasing equitable opportunities for students who might be struggling with the pandemic, and are concerned about the difficulties that will follow during the transition to in-person learning. I feel extremely connected to the student body at UCSB through my involvements on campus and I hope I can use my voice to run under a platform that is dedicated to ensuring all students have equitable opportunities for academic success. I believe that my platform showcases how I not only value changes that will alleviate pressure from students at UCSB during such a turbulent time, but I also value prioritizing services that will help ensure
marginalized groups on campus feel as though they have a voice under my position as a senator.","I have been involved on campus with the office of the external vice president of local affairs
(EVPLA) as Resident & Housing Director as well as being involved in my sorority as the
Director of Finance. Taking the position of the Resident and Housing director for the EVPLA
office has given me the opportunity to collaborate on projects that are continuing to help students
in Isla Vista. Recently, this has been through the collaboration and creation of a Mold survey sent
out to students at UCSB who are experiencing unsafe living conditions regarding the presence of
mold in their homes. With this survey, we hope to bring about tangible change to students who
are tenants in Isla Vista and feel as though landlords take advantage of them. Advocating for
students’ rights as tenants is something extremely important to me and this position has taught
me the importance of responsibility towards the community. Furthermore, this position has given
me the invaluable experience of working as a liaison to the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU).
Going to weekly meetings for both entities has prepared me with the experience of
communication and accountability for the time commitments that are associated with a senate
position for A.S. Furthermore, working as a liaison for IVTU has given me the opportunity to go
to formal board meetings and understand the processes behind student organizations.
Furthermore, my position as Director of Finance for Alpha Phi has given me the experience of
understanding the importance of budgets and how to allocate money to certain places,
prioritizing services or events that will be beneficial for an entire community. Holding this
position in my chapter has also taught me the importance of transparency and compassion in
regard to finances. I believe that these are qualities that would make me a reliable member of the
senate board for AS. Ultimately, however, these positions have given me the opportunity to
expand my leadership skills while in college.","I would like to pass a positional resolution that emphasizes the importance that the
university and CAPs hire additional therapists and practitioners to assist marginalized
communities on campus. I believe that passing a resolution to diversity the types of therapists
UCSB has to offer will help foster a safe space for underrepresented students. Moreover,
bringing on more therapists to CAPs will help eliminate the wait times that discourage many
students from seeking help in the first place. This is a goal in my platform as a senator as well
and by passing this resolution I believe that our school will be able to progress towards an
institution that clearly supports equity and diversion. Moreover, this resolution has the potential
to be extremely beneficial to survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence because it will act
as a resource for these students to have readily available therapists of all different backgrounds
and experiences.
Secondly, I hope to pass a positional statement that demands departments to allow the
current week 10 pass no pass grading policy to be extended for the remainder of the pandemic,
and during the transition to in-person learning. Because many students are concerned about how
the change from remote to in-person learning will affect their success, it is imperative to
maintain this grading policy to ensure the success of students during such a turbulent time.
Third, I hope to pass a bill amending the bylaws of L&S senators to require
communication to the academic senate in order to increase the students’ academic presence in
their governing. I believe that making this a requirement will help hold collegiate senators like
the L&S to vouch for their constituents and ensure that students' rights concerning our education
are being advocated for.","My platform is based upon ensuring advocacy for all students in our community to cultivate a
space of equity, accountability, and safety.
I hope to expand the number of departments that allow P/NP grading for major classes as well as to maintain the week 10 grading change deadline during the transition to in-person learning. As mentioned in question 3, I hope to achieve this goal by passing a positional statement demanding this extension. I also hope to prioritize increasing the hours of essential services on campus when reopening the
university. This includes the AS food bank, printing services, and the AS book bank. I will try to achieve this goal by advocating to fund the expansion of such services.
I have made it a goal to begin the development of adding new majors and minors that would be more applicable to the interests of students and the careers they wish to pursue. By fostering a connection to the academic senate, highlighted in my hopes to pass a bill amending the bylaws of L&S senators to require communication to this entity will bring this vision to life. Working towards eliminating gender and racial prejudice in the classroom by creating workshops for TAs and professors to acknowledge and understand their implicit biases that can lead to subjective grading policies, or in spaces that can make marginalized communities of students feel discriminated against is also something that is very important to my platform and I hope to achieve this goal by directing funding towards services such as this. As alluded to in question three, I also am making it a goal to increase and diversify the types of therapists and counselors that the university and CAPs have through the passage of a positional resolution.
Working to expand internship opportunities for students such as through the creation of a local internship fair is also something that I believe is crucial to my platform as a senator as well. By working with the Office of the EVPLA I hope to get the ground rolling on events such as this, especially during the transition to in-person learning.
Moreover, I hope to foster a sense of community for new and returning students who do not feel connected to campus at UCSB. By working with other AS entities, like the EVPLA office, I hope to begin this process.","With prior experience in the EVPLA office as well as in my panhellenic sorority at ucsb, I hope
to work with these organizations to achieve the goals in my platform. First, I hope to work
collaboratively with the EVPLA office. I believe that, as stated above, my experience in this
entity of A.S has given me the opportunity to understand how this office can positively impact
the students who I will represent. Two of my goals in working with this office are to, one:
expand internship opportunities and, two: work to foster a sense of community for students, both
new and returning. While these are just two of my goals in collaborating with the EVPLA office,
I hope to work together with this office to ensure other goals in the future as well that will
cultivate a positive atmosphere among the community of students here at UCSB. Moreover, as a
member of Greek life myself, I hope to work with Panhellenic and IFC boards to hold our
community accountable to ensure the safe reopening of campus next school year. By working
together on this goal, I hope to ensure members of organizations like mine are being responsible
and reflecting the values that many of these chapters represent.","I will make myself available to my constituents during my term if remote instruction continues in
the 2021-2022 school year by having available office hours every week. This will showcase my
availability to students who would like to voice their concerns and desires as a student to me.
Because it is a goal in my platform to represent all students, especially marginalized groups who
are typically unrepresented, I believe that holding office hours over zoom will ensure that every
student will have access to equitably voice what changes they would like to see. For students
who wish to stay anonymous in their concerns for whatever reason that may be, I also believe
that having an anonymous google document form where students can submit changes they would
like to see would be extremely beneficial. Furthermore, giving students the opportunity to
communicate with me via email is something I would like to institute in my term if elected in
another remotely instructed school year. As we have all seen through remote learning, it is
difficult to ensure equitable access to communication when students are learning in various parts
of the world, or are in living situations unfit for their academic endeavors. This is why I would
like to have at least these three options to give to my constituents during my term.","I believe that my strong work ethic and determination to enact tangible changes on campus make
me the best candidate for this position. I believe that these qualities can be seen in my
experiences on campus through my sorority and through my involvement in A.S. Within my
position as Director of Finance in my sorority, I have gained extremely important attributes that
will help me succeed as a senator in the next senate office. Also, my time working for the
EVPLA showcases the fact that I have had prior experience working with an A.S entity and will
be fully prepared for the necessary requirements of a senator. Furthermore, I had the experience
of holding a job while being a student full time which has given me the opportunity to
understand the time management needed to balance time-consuming commitments. Because I am
running on a platform of advocacy for all students, I believe that I am a good candidate for the
position because I will work diligently to effectively bring to life the visions I am building my
platform on. Additionally, I believe my dedication to transparency and openness as a senator is
something that makes me the best candidate for this position.",Other: Leftist,"Poor: I believe that the A.S senate as a whole has not done a great job of ensuring tangible change on
campus and that this needs to be changed. However, I believe that when looking at Esme,
Manny, and Anusikha’s records as senators, they have worked diligently to bring positive
changes to our campus.","Yes: The companies allegedly profiting from human rights
violations in Israel should be held accountable for their actions. Human rights violation
prevention should not be a controversial topic, and it is important to be cognizant of the fact that
regardless of who commits them, being complicit in the face of such allegations does not uphold
values of transparency or justice. While I do believe that they should be held accountable for the
abuses of human rights that they have allegedly committed, I do not believe that this is a
justification to allow for Anti-Semitic rhetoric towards the Israeli government.","Yes: I do not think that higher education should be something
inaccessible to students due to financial limitations as it cultivates an elitist mindset when
considering learning and growth. Making UCSB tuition-free would also allow students to focus
better on their educational studies as they would be less susceptible to the added stress and
pressure than worrying about how to pay for tuition puts on them.","I do not believe that the mental health services at UCSB are adequate. I think that they
lack the diversity that is needed to foster a safe environment for marginalized communities and
survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. The lack of diversity among therapists
provided by the school makes it hard for many students to feel comfortable coming to them with
their mental health issues. Students in the LGBTQ+ community and students who are Asian
American, Latinx, Black, or Indigenous deserve to have therapists that make them feel
understood and safe in such a vulnerable setting. UCSB needs to improve its multicultural
awareness in its mental health services to become an inclusive place for all students. By
diversifying the types of therapists available, it will serve as a catalyst for change that many
students wish for. Furthermore, with respect to survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence,
diversifying the types of therapists available will also be beneficial to these students because it
will help make clear that the healing process for assault and violence is not a one-size-fits-all. I
also believe that increasing the number of therapists available to students will decrease the wait
times that often discourage people from receiving help in the first place.","As a member of a Panhellenic chapter myself (Alpha Phi), I am also disappointed by the way
that people in the greek life community have behaved throughout the pandemic, and I believe
that with the position we carry as members of a larger community, people in greek life represent
not only themselves as individuals, but the chapter they are in, and the larger body of UCSB as a
whole. Having people in my family become so personally affected by the pandemic, I understand
and can see the necessity of working together to maintain social distancing protocols and ensure
large gatherings are not held. For this reason, I believe that the response to partying in Isla Vista
should have been handled better by ensuring accountability for the students who broke
guidelines. Instituting required workshops and having guest speakers come to (remotely) discuss
the importance of social distancing guidelines is one solution that I believe has the potential to
positively impact UCSB’s community. Educating people on the importance of COVID-19 safety
is one way that the university can work to mend the damage that partying in Isla Vista has
created for Santa Barbara County. I also believe that because Santa Barbara has an older
demographic of people living in the county, students should be diligent about the effects that
their decisions have on a community that is very much at risk.","I believe that in order to demonstrate support for survivors of sexual assault, the university
should be held accountable to offer an increased and diversified amount of CAPs therapists. As
alluded to in prior questions, I genuinely believe that by diversifying the types of therapists
available to students, the university can begin to foster an environment that helps survivors feel
more comfortable getting the help they need to heal. Further, I believe that diversifying the
practitioners on campus at student health marginalized communities and survivors will feel safe
getting the assistance they need after abuse. This is why I am making it a goal in my platform to
a positional resolution that emphasizes the importance that the university and CAPs hire
additional therapists and practitioners to assist marginalized communities on campus. As
mentioned in question number 3, I would like to introduce and author a positional resolution that
emphasizes the importance that the university and CAPs hire additional therapists and
practitioners to assist marginalized communities on campus. Because I believe the university can
do more with the resources it has to support survivors of sexual assault, the introduction of such
a positional resolution will act as a step forward in bringing about additional resources for
survivors of sexual assault as well as domestic violence.","I do not believe that UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups
including members of the Black, Latinx, Indigenous, LGBTQ+ community, and others. One of
the ways that UCSB proves ineffective at assisting these marginalized communities is through
the lack of diversity apparent within CAPs therapists. Having a diverse group of therapists and
counselors available for minority group students will showcase an awareness of the different
backgrounds that students come from. Further, I believe that the European Traditions
requirement on campus represents an inherently discriminatory and biased general education
base. For the Letters and Science GE requirements, only one ethnicity class is necessary for
graduation, yet the school requires an entire course dedicated to European traditions, a clear
sense of prejudice is still prevalent in our education system. By requiring only one ethnicity
requirement despite the various ethnic classes UCSB has to offer, it is clear that change is
necessary to serve these historically underrepresented groups. By requiring classes for students
to understand Asian American, black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, these students will
feel more represented and acknowledged in the curriculum. Another way to remedy this situation
would be to include the European traditions requirement as a satisfactory class within the
ethnicity requirement, rather than making it an independent requirement on its own.","If I am elected to serve on the AS Senate, the first bill or resolution that I plan on
authoring would be a positional statement that demands departments to allow the current week
10 pass no pass grading policy to be extended for the remainder of the pandemic, and during the
transition to in-person learning. This is something that I had mentioned in question three above.
The necessity of this statement is based upon the fact that many students are concerned about
how the change from remote to in-person learning will affect their success, it is imperative to
maintain this grading policy to ensure the success of students during such a turbulent time. I
believe that this positional statement highlights something that the entirety of my constituency
would benefit from. Moreover, within this statement, I would like to demand the inclusion of
other departments to allow such a grading policy for their major requirements. Majors like
Communication, Political Science, Sociology, and more do not allow students to change the
grading of their major courses to P/NP and I believe that by expanding the number of
departments that allows this grading policy within this positional statement would be extremely
helpful to the student body.","I believe that as a senator I would work to involve the student body more and keep them
informed about what the senate is doing by posting on social media a weekly recap of all events
that occurred during the A.S senate meeting that week. I have seen various other senators such as
Esme post informational graphics such as a quarterly review of what has been enacted in her
office and as a senator, I hope to also advocate for a high level of transparency between me and
my constituency if I am voted into office after the election. Furthermore, as I mentioned in a
prior question, I would like to hold weekly office hours where I am available for students to
come and ask questions about the work that I will be doing as a senator. I believe that by opening
up my availability for the students that vote for me, I will be able to foster an environment where
the average student feels like they have equitable access to become aware of the work that
Associated Students (A.S) does. Working within the office of the EVPLA, this is a requirement
for my current position as well, which is why I believe it is a great way to allow students to feel
more informed on what the senate is doing.","Having the personal experience of being forced to leave campus as a freshman in the wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic, to return to campus as a junior in the fall (hopefully, at least) I understand
how frustrating it is to feel as though our tuition money is going towards nothing, or that the
services we pay for are not helping us a clear way. Within my platform, I hope to advocate for
the increased hours of operation of many of the services on campus by directing funding to those
entities. I believe that increasing the hours that many of the essential services that UCSB has to
offer will act as a catalyst for fully opening back the school when it is safe for students.
Furthermore, as a senator, I plan on working closely with the EVPLA office to aid the transition
back to in-person instruction and in-person activity in Isla Vista. This will hopefully take a
tangible effect through cultivating events that will allow students to build a sense of community
with each other on campus and in Isla Vista.
However, as touched upon briefly already, because I have also experienced how detrimental
COVID-19 can be on immuno-compromised students, I understand that the transition back to
in-person learning should take the form of a hybrid solution to ensure that students who are
immuno-compromised, or international students who might face restrictions coming back to
school will get the help they need. Offering hybrid classes for students who cannot attend
in-person classes whether that be for health or other reasons is important.","I believe that the university failed in handling the coronavirus pandemic and remote instruction
by not offering enough resources for students who are struggling. In the wake of the pandemic,
the university has left many students disillusioned by the way they handled transitioning towards
a remote learning environment. I believe that the school should have required TAs and Professors
to attend workshops to help ensure that students living in situations unfit for learning would still
have had access to resources to cultivate equitable learning. Furthermore, I strongly believe it
was unfair for UCSB to not lower the price of tuition despite not giving its students the same
resources that were available when school was in person, prior to the pandemic. Regarding the
sense of community that is lacking among UCSB, I also believe that the school should have
hosted remote mixers to ensure that students who do not feel connected to campus do actually
have a feeling of belonging despite remote learning. I also believe that the university has failed
in reassuring international and immuno-compromised students the solace they need regarding the
transition to in-person learning as well. However, I am also appreciative of the fact that USCB
free has held testing sites for its students throughout the pandemic. These testing sites have given
many students, such as myself, opportunities to get tested for covid-19 in a fast, effective and
safe manner and I think it is important to acknowledge the privilege that students living close to
campus have had in access to these sites.",,,,,,,
Vincent Tran,kat ,L&S Senator,Isla Vista Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162546/vincent-tran.jpg,,He/Him/His,2nd,Chemistry,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 73rd Senate because I would like to enact beneficial
changes that were not previously seen within the previous Senate. While serving within the
Office of the Student Advocate, I was able to connect with different organizations across
campus, and really listen to the needs of the student body and how AS has previously served—or
failed to serve—ALL communities here at UCSB. Being a current 2nd year, my first year on
campus was cut very short, alongside all current first years not being able to step foot on the
university grounds. I am running to be a senator within the 73rd senate because I want to assist in
the transition from online to in-person instruction. This will be an unprecedented task, but I plan
to advocate and work alongside CLAS and department heads to ease the transition, and to remind
professors that it is NOT suitable to resume curriculum as if the pandemic never happened. We
as a senate and as a community must move as one, taking one step at a time, in order to ensure
there is student success across all aspects of not only the College of Letters and Science, but
within the entire UCSB community.","During my first year at UCSB, I served as a Cultural Aspect Coordinator for the 29th Annual
Pilipino Cultural Night within Kaptirang Pilipino (KP) on campus. Even though this was a
leadership position centered around dance and performing arts, this was a great segway for me to
transition into higher education leadership. With KP being the largest AAPI organization on
campus, this role prepared me in public speaking, time management, and conflict administration.
This further pushed me to pursue more leadership roles, where I currently serve as the Retention
Director for KP’s high school retention program: FIERCE. While spearheading the retention
department, I was tasked with overseeing and creating the five pillars which drive FIERCE as a
whole, and give the organization a new sense of direction. Alongside this, I currently serve
within the Executive Office of the Student Advocate General, as the Director of Student Life and
Campus Communications. As stated before, I interacted with different parts of the campus
community, and really strove to find problems UCSB organizations are facing, and find solutions

that we as an office can provide. The OSA office was super beneficial to me, in terms of getting
to experience how an AS entity operates, and open the doors to so many different resources that I
wish I had known when I was an incoming freshman.","The first bill I would like to bring forward is to reallocate funding on campus to better
serve all aspects of the campus. The fact that student tuition remained the same in the midst of
the pandemic was absolutely mind-blowing; we have more than enough money to spend, but
rather these funds are all being put in the wrong places. I want to move these funds to proper
aspects of the campus, such as cultural & LGBTQ+ sections of the Student Resource Building,
or an increase in funding for CAPS in discussion Black and other BIPOC trauma.
Furthermore, I would like to push for a resolution in discussing a fair meal plan on
campus. We are one of the few UC’s on campus who do NOT allow students to use their own
swipes for their peers, or take meals to go. When asked about this, administration states this is to
curb ‘wasting food’, but rather what are we as a community doing to ‘curb’ food insecurity
amongst college students? It is not controversial for someone who can afford a higher meal plan,
to use one of their few swipes for one of their peers. Students should NOT have to go hungry
because of their socio-economic meal plan.
I also would like to introduce a resolution to revamp funding for free testing materials
across the University. It is already extremely expensive enough to attend these institutions, and
now students are expected to purchase more materials in order to take a required exam for a
class. While some may argue “10 cents isn’t even anything,” take those 10 cents for biweekly
exams for four years, and see what students can do with those funds. There is already an
organization working on this on campus, but I would like to revitalize this resource and make it
accessible to everyone on campus, and not just those who know about it within AS.","Within my platform, I plan to address different needs of the College of Letters and Science, and
the overall needs of the UCSB community. First off, my platform includes addressing the lack of
support from the university towards students of color, and the need for resources to promote
anti-Blackness and overall mental health resources for addressing trauma. I plan to work towards
this by proposing a bill to reallocate funds to CAPS and other cultural spheres to work towards a
campus culture of inclusivity and diversity. I also would like to address food insecurity within
the UCSB community, and it’s impact on students. In working towards this, I would like to cover
meal plan policies as well as promote the UCSB pantry. Food insecurity is prominent within so
many communities, and yet there is little being done to address this. Furthermore, I plan on
advocating for all student and university workers within this institution. UCSB4COLA has done
extensive work, and it is our job to fight alongside them against an exploitative system. I plan to
promote UCSB4COLA on all platforms, and to see how I can use my position if elected to best
provide a voice within the senate. They have fought for our future, and now it’s time for us to
stand with them. Moreover, I would like to work to create a better relationship between cultural
organizations and A.S. by continuing to work alongside the OSA office in connecting with
community members. Overall, I want to fight for the well-being of the student body, whether that
be as a constituent or as a senator.","The first organization I also would like to work with CAPS and Acacia in order to make the
resources a lot more accessible to students. When the pandemic hit, my mental health was
affected pretty severely, but the only resources at the time that I could afford was CAPS. The
only problem was that there was at least a month waitlist in order to get a consultation from the
program. While the influx of students isn’t CAPS’ direct fault, I would like to work with them
and with the 73rd Senate to provide more funding and training, in hopes of expanding CAPS
resources for all students, specifically students of color. Another organization I hope to work
with is UCSB4COLA, in bringing awareness to the social inequities that are concurrent across so
many UC campuses. UCSB4COLA, the grassroots organization that stood in solidarity with UC
Santa Cruz, was extremely prominent during the winter quarter of 2020. However, once the
pandemic hit, the organization was then brushed to the side as we navigated through that period
of time. Even though the in-person rallies and strikes were pushed ‘under a rug’, the social
inequities are still prominent and affect thousands of students within the UC system.
UCSB4COLA continues to do great work, especially with their Cops off Campus campaign, and
I hope to further work with them in advocating a fair cost of living adjustment, and a safer
campus where IV Foot Patrol’s reign of power is gone.","I would like to make myself accessible and available to my constituents during the term, by not
only holding office hours, but also virtually attending meetings and events held by community
organizations. I know for certain that within these general meetings, many students find a sense
of community, getting to interact with their peers while also gaining networking skills at the
same time. I want to fully invest myself into the community, and share all the highs and lows
with my constituents. Remote instruction has already hit organizational retention hard this year,
thus I would like to keep advertising for all organizations in terms of social media posts as well
as general outreach. In being able to attend these events and getting to interact with all these
general members, I will then fully understand what problems students face that I wouldn’t be
able to see through my own lense. Furthermore, I would also work alongside board members and
utilize my position as a senator, to fully advocate for the communities that do not have a voice
within the institution. I have started to do feedback outreach within my current position, but I
plan to adopt this into a routine in order to gain feedback and offer as much support as I can,
within a pandemic that has already isolated so many of us.","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position due to my extensive work in and out of
UCSB, regardless of the small time frame I have spent within this institution. With the work I
have done within a smaller organizational sphere to the work I have accomplished within an
executive office, I believe that I am capable of putting in the work to outreach and really listen to
my constituents if elected to this office. On a professional scale, I previously served as a
Programming Intern for Alexander Hamilton Scholars, a nationwide non-profit aimed towards
assisting low-income first generation students, which has helped me gain awareness in terms of
budgeting and networking. Regardless of these positions and titles, I believe that I am the best
candidate for this position because of my compassion for this community. I am a first generation
student, navigating through higher education on my own just like so many students across the
board. I have felt the highs of attending this institution, while also experiencing the neglect this
school has shown towards my community. I am prepared to diligently work to serve the
underserved, and to fully invest myself into making beneficial impacts, with or without a
position.",Left-leaning ,"Good: While I do congratulate the 72nd A.S. Senate on their term
in serving the student body, I have given a good rating due to them being able to accomplish the
things they did in the midst of a pandemic. However, I am an avid believer of there always being
room for improvement, and thus I feel like there could have been more communication with
cultural organizations and such on campus.","This is an issue I do not understand enough about, and thus
I cannot state a vote at this time.","Yes: No one should be deprived of obtaining higher education due to
their socio-economic background. Education needs to be a human right.","While I do believe UCSB mental health resources are beneficial, I do not believe they are
adequate. As previously stated, mental health resources are constantly overlooked and
underfunded. Professionals within CAPS are working towards addressing as many students as
they can, at the current budget being allocated to them. We must work towards providing more
funding for mental health resources for BIPOC, AAPI, and other communities of color. With the
horrors that have been brought to light in the recent year, these communities need the mental
health resources in addressing these traumas. Increased funding will support these programs, and
assist in expanding CAPS as a whole. I also believe the university must strike a deal with Acacia,
in order to further expand other types of resources on campus. In speaking with many
community members, many students benefit from Acacia in comparison to CAPS, due to its
privatized funding and such. We must make mental health affordable to all, and to ensure that

regardless of your wealth or class, or what type of insurance you own, mental health resources
are available to all.","The response to partying could have 100% been handled better by all affiliated groups. It is quite
unbelievable that fines for partying were only applied recently to Isla Vista residents. Though I
agree that some sort of punishment is needed against those partying, I do not believe ONLY a
fine will solve this problem. I support placing sanctions on organizations that choose to party in
terms of AS funding. Some might argue that this is too extreme, but what’s extreme is that
marginalized communities within Isla Vista are paying the price for the selfish decisions of party
goers. The university should be embarrassed that this institution CONTINUES to hold the title of
a “party school” during a global pandemic. In terms of individual punishments, I believe this
should be handled as seriously as academic dishonesty within the Judiciary branch. When
discussing community problems while serving in the OSA, this institution continued to focus on
punishing students for academic dishonesty, while turning a blind eye to federal health violations
within the community. We also must hold IV Foot Patrol accountable for their failure to protect
the community during these times. While living in IV, I would often see police officers walk past
parties and do absolutely nothing in addressing these violations at hand.","I am familiar with the University’s Title IX office, and it’s mission in making UCSB a sexual
harassment and discrimination free zone. I believe the university must always believe survivors
instead of invalidating them. We must hold people accountable, and to show that we as a
university stand against sexual assault and harassment. While I do support it is important to hold
those accountable, the university can support survivors by providing more funding for resources
to best help survivors on their path of healing. As a survivor myself, I found that it can be an
extremely lonely path, and at times it was difficult to confide in mental health resources on
campus. There simply is not enough funding to properly train staff in handling sexual assault
matters. I also believe that these resources can be made more transparent to students. When I
entered the university, I had no idea what the Title IX office was, and yet it wasn’t until my 2nd
year that I was able to utilize the office. Accessible resources must be transparent to the entire
student body. I know that when I entered the university, I never expected to be a victim of sexual
assault, and yet here I stand as a survivor. I want to work with the university in expanding
resources to not only hold attackers accountable, but to do as much as I can to assist survivors in
their path of healing.","UCSB has not effectively served historically represented groups. On this campus, there is little
being done to support any of these groups, and provide basic resources and spaces. In terms of
supporting Black students, it was extremely embarrassing and inconsiderate for the university to
do absolutely nothing after the death of George Floyd, and instead direct students to consult the
Black Student Union. Black students were already facing trauma, and yet now the university is
placing another burden on them by directing community members to them. The university also
failed to protect the Indigenous community, when they were arrested, and still continues to
support building on top of sacred land (Mauna Kea). Furthermore, there is little to no resources
and spaces for Latinx community members, and yet this institution champions being a school of
diversity. While UCSB has provided some resources to underrepresented students in our campus
community, such as EOP, ONDAS, the Women’s Center and RCSGD, there is still work to be
done in facilitating longevity and stability for these modes of community support. These
resources offered by the institutions, as well as the network of cultural and student-led
organizations on campus, dedicate themselves to serving the needs of their respective
communities, and AS should continue to offer them organizational and financial support.","If I am elected to serve on the A.S. Senate, the first resolution I plan to author, is a directional
resolution that would be a proposal to administration about the possibility of a COVID vaccine
pop up within Isla Vista. While student health is doing what they can to vaccinate as many
student workers, we must continue to vaccinate everyone in order to reach herd immunity. I plan
to work with local communities and alongside administration in contacting the health department
for the possibility of this pop up. I also would like to include vaccine informational workshops
and such within this legislation, in order to further inform the community about the types of
vaccines available, and what is the best choice for each individual. This COVID vaccine pop up
will not only benefit the student body, but also the marginalized communities that also reside
within Isla Vista with us. Immigrants are more likely to not get vaccinated, due to
misinformation being spread about citizenship requirements, and thus I would like to push for
these clinics to better serve and vaccinate those communities that were hit the hardest during the
pandemic. In vaccinating all parts of Isla Vista, things brings the transmission rates down, which works to the benefit of the UCSB community. ","As a senator, I plan to keep the student body informed and involved by releasing monthly
progress reports on social media. I believe that constituents are entitled to senate meeting
minutes, and to fully understand what is being voted on. Alongside these progress reports, I also
plan on hosting open forums, where students can voice concerns and needs to be brought to the
senate floor. Whether that be virtual or in person, I hope to gain feedback and to update my
constituents on the resolutions and bills that are being voted on. These positions are voted on by
the student body, and thus it is a senator’s duty to inform constituents, and ensure that they are
voting based on the best interests of the community. In terms of social media, I also would
promote engagements, in terms of polling and weekly posts, such as those being done by the
EVPLA office this year.","As a senator, I plan to meet with department heads in order to coordinate the transition from
virtual to in-person instruction. We must remind professors that we can’t just jump straight into
in-person lectures, and expect results that were present during pre-pandemic times. Professors
can not just use an in-person exam from 10 years ago, and expect students to properly soak in the
course material. I would also work with CLAS to expand their resources, and to allocate funding
to provide resources for all students. CLAS and CAPS will be seeing an influx of students, and
thus it is important for them to receive the support needed. In terms of in-person activity in Isla
Vista, I plan to contact local health departments, to see what is allowed in terms of COVID-19
safety, and in accordance with Santa Barbara County guidelines. It is super important that we
don’t rush into a fast and irresponsible reopening, and risk making Isla Vista into another
COVID-19 hotspot. I would also like to work alongside administration, to reopen the mask
project, in administering masks across the community. Though with the vaccine here, we must
continue to act with caution, and to protect each other as community members.","I believe the university failed in handling the pandemic by not reprimanding reckless students.
While I understand that UCSB is not responsible for the actions done by residents in IV, there
should have been more consequences for students creating a dangerous learning environment.
Many students broke social distancing and quarantine guidelines, as well as orders to wear
masks. UCSB should be a safe environment for all students and they should have done more to
make sure students were being held accountable for their actions.
I also believe that the university’s professors failed to recognize the gravity of the coronavirus
pandemic. While mental health workshops and resources are good, the school should have done
more to get to the ROOT of what’s causing student mental distress - heavy academic workloads.
Many professors I had throughout this school year had no empathy when it came to students
being distressed by the pandemic. They held their classes as if everything was normal, even
though it is much more difficult and mentally draining to do remote school work. I feel that the
school should have made P/NP an option for ALL classes, instead of leaving it up to the
department to decide.",,,,,,,
Hannah Lee,asumi,Transfer Senator,Isla Vista Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162813/hannah-lee.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,3rd,Political Science,,,"I’m running for Senate because I believe that I can make a difference for transfer students not only on campus but also off. Transfer students offer a unique perspective to UCSB because we have been able to see how other schools operate and what works for them and what doesn’t. That is why I want to run as the Transfer senator, to offer a new set of eyes on the issues that affect all of us. I personally believe that I am able to bring a refreshing change with thisto UCSB that includes but is not limited to fighting for issues such as sexual assault on campus, housing stability, food security, all problems that affect our students in some way shape, or form. I know that this past year has not been easy especially when it comes to online learning for that reason I want to expand resources and programs that aim to provide transfers with clarity and ease. This is why I want to run, I want to run to be the Transfer Senator because I want to make sure every voice is heard, acknowledged, and represented. Being a first-gen student has taught me a lot about myself, it has taught me that I am capable of much more than I would have ever thought with that being said, I am compassionate, hardworking, and excited to embark on this journey with all of you. ","Prior to UCSB, I transferred from SBCC, I worked alongside an organization called the SBCC Ambassadors. During my time at CC, I worked with international students to create an easier and smoother transition to a community college. Because of this, I was able to learn a great deal not only about local students but also students from abroad and what they need to help them through college. Not only did I work for hands-on with students but I also worked particularly in the human resources committee which aimed at creating and helping those with the application process of joining the ambassador program. I also worked at getting more students involved in extracurriculars. As an ambassador, I aimed to increase cultural awareness on campus and in Santa Barbara. Being an ambassador has prepared me for the senate because it has allowed me to see what students need and how to help with their transition. It has also allowed me to be an ally
and understand the concerns of minority groups on campus. I know that many SBCC students transfer into UCSB. That is why I feel even more confident in taking on the role of transfer senator because I have seen what it takes to help prepare students for transitioning to college and providing relief and assistance for those in need. ","As the transfer senator one resolution I would like to introduce is adding workshops aimed at allowing transfer to get comfortable and informed with the websites that UCSB offers. Personally, when I transferred in from SBCC we had been using Canvas however, I found myself lost when it came to using GOLD and Gauchospace. That is why I would propose creating online workshops that help students get comfortable with the online formats. Additionally, I would propose adding a tab for transfers to access on GOLD with an in-depth list of resources/people to contact within the transfer community. Next, I would propose reopening the Pardall Center, SAFELY! We need a place within Isla Vista that not only transfer students but students, in general, can go for help with school or everyday life. This pandemic has been rough on all of us and that is why keeping our mental health as a top priority should be everyone’s goal, with that being said, reopening the Pardall Center creates a safe place for people to decompress and find the resources that they need. Another thing I would like to propose is guaranteed housing for transfer students throughout their journey at UCSB. School should be the top priority for our students, it shouldn’t be worrying where you're going to live. ","My platform is to strive for the success of all transfer students! Specifically, I aim to bridge the gap between transfers and non-transfer students. I wish to add a tab in GOLD specifically for transfer students to access with a complete list of resources they may need, whether it be contact information, emails, names, you name it. I want to create a healthier and more sustainable environment on campus. I aim to revitalize and reopen the Pardall Center, creating not only a safe place to go but more importantly a resource for those in need. I will form coalitions/committees that work to collaborate with one another on the issues that we are all passionate about, fighting against sexual assault, food security, and housing stability. Like myself, I will help first-generation students who may be feeling a sense of unease with this transition to online learning. I plan to achieve my goals by working hands-on with other transfer students, listening to your concerns, and aiding in any way I can. Where there is power there are numbers, that is why we will achieve these goals with the help of one another. I will further achieve these goals by working with other senators who are as passionate as I am about the student body's concerns.","There are such great organizations on campus, specifically for me, I want to work with organizations whose utmost important goal is to better the lives of our student body. For example, I hope to work right alongside the Transfer Student Alliance, in creating a more inclusive community of transfer students. Working with the TSA will help me better understand and be more connected to transfers. I know that adding a tab in Gold for transfer students to go to have a list of resources is not going to be easy, however, working with the TSA together will make it easier for us to fight for the needs of one another. I hope to work with CALPIRG, an organization aimed at providing a better more sustainable environment not only for our generation but the generations to come. I personally love what CALPIRG stands for, offering services and support to fight hunger, create 100% renewable energy on campus, help eliminate plastic waste in our oceans. With that in mind, I also hope to work with Students Against Sexual Assault, an organization dedicated to ending all sexual assault and sexual harassment on campus and off. It’s about time that we stopped fearing the consequences of speaking up and instead tell our story. "," will make myself available no matter the circumstances that may head our way in the 2021-2022 school year. I will hold weekly office hours for those who can come by, I will do my best to deliver any help that I can whether that be for school or life in general. If my office hours don’t work I will also make myself available for appointments. I want to provide transparency for our transfer students, for that very reason, I will hold myself accountable to provide the best assistance that I can for you. I will also do my best at holding myself accountable and reaching out to you guys. I completely understand that not all of us have the accessibility to wifi so if office hours don’t work we can figure out setting up some sort of phone call. Additionally, you can always reach me through social media. I want to help the transfer community in any way possible that is why I want to get to know every single one of you. I will do my absolute best at providing any assistance that I can, my emails are always open! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, or concerns at Hannahnlee@ucsb.edu. ","What makes me the best candidate for this position is the fact that I am determined to provide as much relief and assistance as possible that I can for transfer students. I am passionate about creating a more diverse and inclusive environment. I want to dedicate my life to politics as it is and that is why I am so driven to be your next transfer senator. Being a first-gen student myself, I am new to all of this however, I think that’s a trait that helps me stand out because I am eager to make UCSB a better and safer place. I am still learning every day about myself and how I can be a better student leader. I think with compassion, a good heart, and drive anything is possible, for that reason, I know that I am the best candidate for this position because I will work for the needs of the transfers and the student body as a collective whole. I don’t claim to have all the answers or be the smartest person in this race but I am inspired by those running with and against me for that reason no matter if you voted for me or not I will continue to fight for you and your needs.",Left-leaning,"Very Good: I believe that the 72nd A.S. Senate did the best job that they could given the circumstances, however, I don’t believe that they were prepared enough to handle the transition to online learning. With that being said, however, no one was prepared for Covid-19 so in my opinion, they did the best that they could. ","At this current time I do not feel like I am educated enough on either side of this debate to formally articulate whether or not I support these efforts. Moving forward, I will look more into this resolution and discuss with my peers the best way to handle this movement.","Yes: 100% I believe tuition should be free. College is incredibly expensive which makes it hard for minority students to be able to afford it. Higher education should not have a price tag, wanting to learn more and investing in your future should not come down to if you can afford it or not. UCSB is a multi-million dollar institution, they should be able to handle a tuition-free learning experience. 
","I think there are amazing mental health services at UCSB however I believe that we need to make them more accessible to students especially now. With everything that we have been through this year, our mental health is a top priority, that is why we need to make mental health services more equitable for our students. I am aware of students in the past having a hard time making appointments to see counselors on campus. There has been a huge backlog of students seeking mental health services, which is not okay. To further prevent this from happening we need to expand and better account for the needs of the students, whether that is adding more licensed professionals to cut down on the long wait times that our students face when seeking mental health services. I also believe dedicating more time to research regarding what stresses our students in this very day and age is incredibly important. If we can figure out what makes our students stressed especially during this time of uncertainty I believe it will help our community as a whole. Nonetheless, I will make it a priority of mine to help students facilitate their needs and create a healthier environment not only on campus but off, even virtually. 
","I do believe that the university could have handled the beginning of the pandemic much better. I believe they failed us when it came to addressing the partying within IV. There is no justification for holding gatherings that are not abiding by the CDC guidelines. I get the fact that students don’t want to be stuck inside their house however, it was what had to be done at that time and for those who didn’t follow the rules there should have been harsher punishments. For example, whether that be being fined or for those who have been caught in multiple discrepancies academic probation. We need to hold each other accountable, the organizations, greek life, and individuals themselves should be doing everything in their power to work together and end the spread of Covid-19. It is incredibly irresponsible to continue to host large gatherings no matter the circumstances. In my opinion, the university did not step up like it should have to address the concerns and safety of those living in Isla Vista. There should have been a more accessible way for us students to report incidents in IV that we felt were unsafe and quite frankly unjustifiable. Personally, the school did not make it easy for me to feel safe and protected against Covid-19 living in Isla Vista. 
","I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and I am also aware of the fact that the office is currently closed and only responding to those through email. The university needs to do a better job at making its office more accessible for its students. There needs to be better communication and commitment when it comes to addressing and showing support for survivors of sexual assault. I believe the university can make itself more available for survivors of sexual assault, filing a report online is not enough. Holding the parties responsible and accountable for sexual assault violations is just scraping the surface of being enough. We need to make our campus and environment around us better and safer, this does not mean increasing policing but instead having the university listen to what we students want. The process of filing a report can cause severe PTSD for the victim and can be a months-long process. That is not fair to the victim of sexual assault who so bravely filed the complaint in the first place. There needs to be a better allocation of resources for the victims of sexual assault to be heard and acknowledged not only on campus but also off. ","I believe UCSB as an institution does a decent job when it comes to serving historically underrepresented groups, however, there can always be room for improvement! Adding more minority voices within AS to represent those that are normally underrepresented should be a top priority for UCSB. Since UCSB is a minority-serving institution and was the first to be recognized as a Hispanic serving institution, the recognition and dedication should be able and accessible to all students that come from minority backgrounds. I want to stress the importance of giving every person a voice on campus alongside a place to be heard. It is time for those who have been underrepresented in the past to no longer feel that weight on their shoulders. I don’t want to discredit the work that AS has put in and the organizations put in place, for example, EOP, La Familia de Colores, Queer Commissions, and the many other organizations whose top priority is to provide assistance and relief for those on and off campus. However, like I stated before there can always be room for improvement. Moving forward, I will make it a priority of mine to serve as a transfer senator for every historically underrepresented group on campus. 
","If I were lucky enough to serve as your transfer senator I would enact my first bill for my constituents. Transfer students face an increased mental health concern as well as feeling distressed academically due to the rapid pace of the quarter system that many of us are not used to. That is why my first bill would be to allocate more resources for transfers to feel at ease in their transition to the more stiff and academically challenging university. I found myself incredibly lost when I first transferred into UCSB, navigating the courses, Gauchospace, and gold brought me an extreme amount of stress that was not necessary. For that very reason, making these sites more accessible and providing workshops on how to navigate the sites will be a part of my resolution. I believe TSA does a great job in representing the transfer community however, I feel like in these unprecedented times we should be having more resources rather than not enough resources for our transfer students. Making it a top priority of mine to provide resources aimed at allowing transfer students to understand course websites before school even starts. Personally, I would like to provide workshops that are geared towards transferring students in their transition to a more rigorous institution. ","As a senator, I would work alongside the transfer community, committed to providing myself as a resource for those who wish to get more involved in the information happening in A.S.. By working alongside transfer students and the committees that have been formed will help me better understand what it is that our students want and need. I will make myself available for those who wish to be informed and involved in the things that the Senate is doing as well as being an aid for detailing to the student body their needs and concerns. I would take the necessary steps with helping bridge the gap between transfer and their needs as individuals. I want to be not only an ally but a representative resource for those wishing to understand what is happening in the senate. I wish to make the senate more transparent and accessible to students, adding in more media outlets that cover what the senate is up to is vastly important for allowing students to feel more aware of the decisions regarding their student body. Communication has to be a top priority especially in times like these when everything is really uncertain and up in the
air. A.S. needs to dedicate more time to communicate with the student body and vice versa, the student body should feel safe and empowered to express their concerns and their ideas for the future and betterment of the university. ","Moreover, I want to make the transition back to in-person instruction and in-person activity within Isla Vista and on-campus as smooth, safe, and accessible as possible. I believe adding more vaccine availability within the community should be a top priority for UCSB students and administration, this is because gathering herd immunity will alleviate the stress and concerns of Covid and the safety of reopening our school. Additionally, having more resources available to educate students on the vaccine is also important and I believe will help ease some students who may be apprehensive about receiving the vaccine. I would aid in contracting more transparency within our student body and accessing the needs of our students and community first, we are all in this together. For one thing, that is why I find these unprecedented times a learning experience for us and further allows us to really access what was missing within our school and community even before Covid. I will aid in being not only a resource to our community but I will personally make sure that when we reopen we will be following the CDC guidelines and taking every possible safety precaution to ensure the wellbeing of our students and faculty. ","First of all, speaking from a personal transfer perspective, I believe the university failed in preparing us for transfers for online learning. The resources out there are not enough, they're hard to find and even harder to navigate. I understand that a worldwide pandemic was not on many of our radars however the university should have been more communicative with us in not only addressing us but also our concerns about the safety and wellbeing of our community and students. I think the university succeeded eventually in providing us students with testing options for Covid. Overall, this should be a learning experience for the university in the years to come in regards to online instruction. Moving forward, I believe the university should hold itself accountable for any stress and concerns that it gave to the student body during this challenging time. With this in mind, I also believe that the university could have done a better job in preparing the faculty for online learning. In addition, I know online learning is hard for all of us but we must remember that our professor’s worked around the clock to provide us with the best learning environment possible. Moving forward, the university should reward professors and students for hanging in there and doing the best possible job we could have.",,,,,,,
April Zhang,asumi,International Senator,Isla Vista Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162650/april-zhang.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,1st ,Sociology,,,"It is the first year with positions of international senators. This is a position my fellow international peers fought hard to get, and I definitely want to use this position to facilitate more connections, resources, and opportunities for the UCSB international student community. An international student from China, this is my fifth year living and studying in the United States. I fully resonate with all my international peers’ struggles of living thousands of miles away from home, studying and speaking in our non-native language. Arriving at a new set of political systems and beliefs at age 14, I had barely any idea about politics, let alone public policies and global relations. Throughout the years, however, I have witnessed the growingly tense relationship between the two countries that have both affected and shaped my ideals and beliefs, the increasing difficulty being an international student in the U.S., and heartbreaking humanitarian, societal, and civil crises that took place in both countries. Curious and frustrated by all of this, I was inspired to not only advocate for the international student community, but also work to better connect international and American students. Despite my position and work, I have dedicated the vast majority of my extracurricular activities and time to inspiring further mutual understanding across cultures and countries. I hope to use my platform to represent and advocate for ALL international students, and create a more organized, sophisticated, and personalized support system. With my previous leadership and organizational experiences in high school international student organization and my everlasting passion about international student support and community building, I want to set a successful and efficient precedent for all future international senators to come.","Though a first-year, I am very actively involved in the UCSB and Isla Vista communities. Being the Administrative Chair at A.S. Commission for Marginalized Genders, I am responsible for the administrative and community outreach aspects of the commission, as well as organizational support to projects and events proposed by the board members. As a fellow in the Office of the President, my current projects include the campus-wide Mental Health Town Hall, the development and implementation of the Mental Health/Wellness GE course, and the support of minority student organizations on proposals and policies. Through these positions I gained a better understanding of UCSB Associated Students and the UC system, and improved on my communicational and organizational skills. I have also been serving as a Federal Policy Analyst in A.S. External Affairs Committee. I research specific policies pertaining to human rights and international relations, analyze their impacts on global and campus levels, and compile related information into weekly policy briefs. I have developed and enhanced my knowledge and ability in researching policies and analyzing their effectiveness pertaining to the particular situation at hand. I am experienced and skilled in synthesizing my research through written and oral communication, collaborating with others and presenting my ideas in writing, formal speeches, and discussions. Additionally, I am one of the co-coordinators of Eco Vista Community, a community organization that aims to transform Isla Vista into an eco-village in upcoming decades through various student-led community projects. I have organized a working group regarding the Isla Vista Community Plan; we have been and will continue attending meetings with Isla Vista Community Services District (IVCSD) and other community entities regarding the plan, and outlining our visions for a potential new plan. I am also actively working to increase the influence and scope of the organization by having a campus club as its UCSB chapter and turning the community group into a nonprofit organization, both of which will enable greater funding, name recognition, and influence. Through these positions I not only improved on my abilities in communication, organization, and advocacy, but also gained sufficient experiences and understanding of the structure of UCSB Associated Students and the overall campus. All above experiences have effectively prepared me for the work I will be responsible for if selected to serve on the 73rd Senate. ","One of the first bills I’d like to introduce while in office is to provide accommodations for international students. Academically, I want to ensure that those who are unable to return to the U.S. just yet still have sufficient remote classes to choose from. These classes should mostly be asynchronous, with limited synchronous components, deriving from the understanding that many are living in vastly different time zones that are often more than 10 hours apart from California. Additionally, I want to work with the Office of International Students & Scholars to provide timely updates for visa support and other services alike. Another urgent bill will be establishing COVID conscious guidelines for the partial or complete reopening of campus in the future. Included in the bill are the required threshold of students vaccinated in order to reopen safely, the continued accessibility of daily COVID testing resources, as well as the implementation and enforcement of safety guidelines in indoor environments such as dorms and lecture halls. In the bill, I will make sure to clarify international students’ self-isolation and vaccination requirements, in consideration of the potential side effects of receiving vaccines from different countries. I also hope to implement international student positions in A.S. Senate through bills or resolutions. There are limited positions in A.S. designated to serve the international student community, largely contributing to the disconnection between international and American students at UCSB. I want to establish positions in various AS entities and offices, focused on better serving and connecting with international students. This brings in more opportunities for cultural and international student organizations to collaborate with A.S. on organizing events, launching programs, and similar opportunities. In addition, I want to work to create internship opportunities at the broader community and to open some existing resources to international students, who are currently ineligible for the vast majority of grants. These combined measures shall grant international students more voices and adequate representation in Associated Students, resolving the commonly felt disconnect between A.S. and the student body, in particular international students. ","First and foremost, I plan to ensure international students’ safe and efficient return to campus. I will also work to ensure that there is a sufficient amount of remote classes opening in future quarters for those who are unable to return yet. I will work with the Office of International Students and Scholars to assist and support international students in reentering the U.S. and returning to campus. This will be delivered by providing frequent email updates on the visa application process, vaccination requirements, and tips for living in Santa Barbara, considering many students might have never stepped foot on campus before. I will also work with the Academic Senate and other A.S. resources to ensure that a sufficient number of remote classes continue to open in the fall and future quarters, to accommodate those who are unable to return to in-person instructions yet. 
I will also work to establish a one-on-one mentorship program for international students, establishing an international Gaucho quarterly survey system, creating new and opening new opportunities for international students, and personalizing academic, mental health, career, and legal resources to international Gauchos’ needs and backgrounds. These will be done by meeting with related organizations and offices and by introducing and drafting bills and resolutions. More
details about these platforms and my steps taken will be addressed in my responses to the following questions. 
Lastly, I plan to organize workshops and events on topics such as visa renewal and sexual assault with A.S. Global Gaucho Commission and related campus organizations. ","As I wish to ensure international students a smooth transition to the next academic year, either remotely or in-person, I will start meeting with the Office of International Students & Scholars, International Student Advisory Board, AS Global Gaucho Commission, and international student organizations. I will work with these offices and other related campus organizations to organize workshops and events on topics that international students need to be—yet are often not—familiar with. 
To create and launch the one-on-one mentorship program, I will also collaborate with the above entities, Student Engagement & Leadership, Office of Student Life, and Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life. Together, we can also finalize the details on creating positions and internships and opening existing opportunities, to international students. To provide more inclusion to the international LGBTQ+ community, I want to work particularly with organizations such as Commission for Marginalized Genders and Trans and Queer Commission on establishing positions and creating events geared toward international students. In regards to my aimed reform for academic, mental health, career, and legal resources on campus, I will work with CAPS, CARE, Career Services, and A.S. Legal Resources Center to discuss their current training and system, as well as potential future actions. In addition, I will meet with the Academic Senate to ensure there are accommodations in place for international Gauchos who are unable to return to campus. I will also discuss the quarterly survey system I plan to implement with international student organizations and offices, and will ensure the logistics with IT professionals at the university. ","Aside from the instagram account, AS email, and other social media platforms where my constituents can reach me, I will also publicize my WeChat account. WeChat is a social network widely used by Chinese international students, and I hope that doing so will establish a more personal relationship with my international peers, as well as a more efficient method of communication. I will also work to establish a quarterly survey system online. The system will collect international students’ concerns, comments and questions about anything related to UCSB and will close by the end of every quarter. The feedback received will serve as guidelines for my future plans and action items as an international senator, learning how to best satisfy the needs and concerns of my constituents. I will work to make sure that this system maintains after my term and remains available and efficient for future international senators and international students. This feedback system will be hyperlinked on all senate-related social media platforms, to allow for the greatest amount of access. In fact, I also have plans to open a public official account on WeChat, where I can more efficiently share my work in A.S. Senate, my visions for the international student community, and the survey system. ","I have a lot of previous experiences working in international student organizations, advocating and planning events for international students. In high school, I served as the Activities Officer for Diffusion, the international student organization in high school. I hosted the annual Diffusion-themed, school-wide assemblies and monthly members meetings. I have also created the Mentorship and Tutoring program for incoming foreign students, which provided information sessions about high school and college life in the U.S. and implemented international upperclassmen as one-on-one mentors and tutors. These events and programs I implemented elicited popular responses among my peers, were very popular among my international high school peers, and have effectively gaged a better relationship between international and American student community, allowing for more possibilities of collaborative cultural events in the future. With these experiences in mind, I hope to implement similar measures to support international Gauchos and help them better adapt to the campus community. I have been very actively involved in AS Boards, Committees, Units, as well as Executive Offices. Throughout this school year, I have been serving in the A.S. Office of the President, Commission for Marginalized Genders, and External Affairs Committee for various positions. The various positions I am undertaking have granted me more than sufficient knowledge about the A.S. structure, and how the different branches of ASUCSB function in conjunction with one another. Additionally, my communications and leadership experiences allow me to synthesize my research and problems encountered into tangible ideas, and to communicate and deliver them confidently in front of people. Entering the Senate with these understanding in mind, I can confidently see myself putting out ideas, actively communicating and collaborating with those within and out of A.S. Senate, and making visible changes to the future of UCSB and Gauchos. I
believe I am the best candidate for the position of International Senator, and ask that you put the same faith in me throughout the election season. ",Left-leaning,"Good: This year has been a difficult time for all. As such, I think the student body expected more actions from A.S. Senate than it has actually done. While this is also a challenging time for the senators, there should be more done in terms of stopping large gatherings, reducing racial discriminations, and implementing some form of punishment for students who have taken said actions. A.S. Senate already has a name for being distant from students and their actual needs, and that will definitely be one of my core focuses if I become a part of the upcoming Senate. 
","Yes: I would definitely vote in favor of a resolution to divest. Such alignment brings a negative light to the Associated Students, even to UCSB as a whole, and shall be definitely opposed. A.S. should be in active communication with other UC’s student associations if there is any help or support needed, as they have exemplified great precedents for us. ","No: Tuition-free would be ideal, but is not feasible at the current moment. We should fight to lower tuition and fight against all and any form of tuition hikes in the upcoming academic year as we transition back to more in-person college experiences. I am particularly passionate about lowering tuition and other school-related fees for international students, first-generation college students, and low-income students. ","Their services cover various aspects and are relatively adequate, but they can definitely be improved, and I definitely plan to do so. I want to personalize mental health, legal, and other campus resources to students’ backgrounds and struggles. Especially for international students, these resources that are meant to support all students shouldn’t barge on their language and cultural barriers. I also want to talk to the directors at the services regarding their training and hiring process. As the international senator, I want to ensure that there is sufficient cross-cultural training so that the professional and peer advisors can best serve students with a global background. If such training is not in place or is not sufficient, I will work with the directors and other resources to implement necessary training components and materials. While I do not want to interfere excessively with their hiring process, I do wish to ensure that the backgrounds from which international students come from are relatively adequately represented across the professionals and peer advisors, so that the students can always talk to people who share their cultures and thus understand their thoughts and struggles. Ideally, there should be at least one advisor or staff speaking the native language of the international student.","The response to the constant partying and mass gathering incidents in Isla Vista definitely could have been handled better by the university, as well as the country and Greek life, as the vast majority of students partying are attending UCSB. The university and Greek life should meet to agree on similar terms in regards to punishments to such health violations. Upon such agreements, there shall be bills and resolutions passed to have concrete policies and guidelines in place. The bill or resolution should also detail methods to report and punishable consequences. Students should be able to report incidents of partying to Associated Students and/or an Executive Office, such as the Student Advocate General; the student(s) shall then be contacted and the incident be researched, to ensure the validity of such report. At their first attempt of large gathering and/or partying, the student reported shall be removed from their Greek life and any A.S. entities and offices that they are a part of. At their second attempt, they shall be facing academic consequences as well, such as academic probation. If the student continues to hold or attend large gatherings, they shall face further punishments and measures from Associated Students. ","I am relatively familiar with the Title IX office, but I think it should definitely be more advertised. Overall, it is not well known to the general student body, and thus limits their abilities to help and protect our students. As I work to reform various resources offered to students, including mental health resources, I also want to work to ensure the university’s Title IX office and its functions be more frequently brought up in various conversations.
","Though there are good things being done by the university to serve historically underrepresented groups on its campus, it is definitely not enough, and much more can be done in such regard. Taking, for example, the ongoing anti-Asian sentiments seen not only across the country but also
in the university: while there are statements published expressing the administration’s deepest condolences and calling for more unity and inclusivity, there is no tangible being done. These statements grant nice and supportive sentiments to the campus, yet in reality offer no actual impact on the situation. In essence, it doesn’t do anything. There are no punishable consequences for the discriminatory actions, and there is no complete system to report such incidents. Of course, there are amazing actions being done as this statement is being written. However, most of these actions are done by only a small fraction of students within A.S. Once I enter into the incoming Senate, I hope to work more closely with school administrations on passing tangible resolutions that not only offer a sense of support but also truly make an impact on the situation at hand. I also want to support international LGBTQ+ folks in particular, as they feel isolated in the LGBTQ+ community as well as the international community. While part of my platforms is to organize events and personalize resources, I will always keep them in mind as I work to better resources and opportunities on campus, so that they may feel more at home being a student at UCSB. ","Before all else, I’d like to introduce a bill or resolution in the Senate titled Stop Asian Hate. And this bill will do what its name implies: to stop Asian hate in the overall campus and surrounding community. This bill will protect Asian and Asian-heritaged students against hate crimes and discriminatory actions. Students shall be able to report such matters to Associated Students and/or one of its entities, who should then evaluate the received allegations, and the students reported shall be facing punishable consequences for their actions. UCSB is not the best in supporting its Asian and international students, and this bill aims to fulfill part of the lack of resources granted to these communities over the past years. International students, the majority of whom are Asian, will greatly benefit from the bill, as they are also frequently targeted and blamed for the pandemic. 
While this bill or resolution will primarily focus on protecting students of Asian and related backgrounds, I also want to protect all underrepresented students against any form of hate crimes and discriminations. Once this initial, and the most urgent, bill is passed, I will work diligently with my fellow senators to propose more legislations aiming for the same measures for all students. ","As the international senator, I will start by publicizing my WeChat account. WeChat is a social media platform very popular among Chinese international students, and by doing so I hope to make myself more available to my constituents. I plan to create a WeChat public account, which allows me to post articles about important Senate updates. After setting these accounts on WeChat. I also plan to launch a quarterly survey system. The system will collect international students’ concerns, comments, and questions about anything related to UCSB. All responses will be available to the international senators, and can be disclosed to other offices related to international students, as the situation pertains. The feedback system will be linked and accessible on all my Senate-related social media platforms, including my to-be-created WeChat public account. The feedback received will serve as guidelines for my future plans and action items as an international senator, learning how to best satisfy the needs and concerns of my constituents. I will work to make sure that this system maintains after my term and remains available and efficient for future international senators and international students. If possible, I also hope to implement this system for the rest of Senate and Associated Students. As my work in the Senate progresses, I will work with the Office of International Students & Scholars to include important Senate updates in emails sent to all international Gauchos. In the long term, I also plan to establish a one-on-one mentorship program. Incoming international Gauchos will take a survey, and the data in the survey will be used to match them with an international upperclassman as their mentor. The interested upperclassmen will receive necessary training before becoming a mentor, and should be considered a part of A.S. once they become a mentor in the program. They will meet with their mentees every two weeks in the fall quarter, and should remain available for all questions. ","In the gradually starting transition back to in-person instructions and more in-person activities, the school needs to enforce guidelines with punishable results to students on UCSB campus and Isla Vista. As a senator, I will work with school administrations to ensure and establish the details of necessary policies for a safe environment. These include and are not limited to: the threshold of students vaccinated in order to reopen safely; COVID guidelines in dorms, lecture halls, and other indoor settings, which need to be strictly enforced in the beginning of quarters; the means to support international students’ vaccination, considering the potential side effects of receiving two types of vaccines from different countries. There are additional barriers for international students to return to campus in the fall. Given that U.S. embassies are closed in countries where many international students are from and currently reside in, the most immediate question is entry into the U.S. For many first year students, this means they cannot renew or apply for F-1 visas in order to enter as an international student. I will reach out to and work with the Office of International Students & Scholars (OISS) to be in active communication with all international students regarding other options of visa application to ensure a safe and unproblematic entry into the country. For those who are unable to return yet, I will also work to ensure that there are a sufficient amount of remote classes available in upcoming quarters, with mostly asynchronous or limited synchronous components. ","Over this past academic year, the university gave school-wide reminders to stay indoor during all holidays. However, the university alo greatly disappointed me and many other students in that their actions essentially stopped there. While we kept hearing cases of parties in Isla Vista and, in the case of international students, having to attend classes at 3 am, there was no further action taken to stop the large gatherings or create more accommodations for students in a different time zone. The school administrations and Associated Students have the ability, yet failed, to implement stricter policies to punish and/or restrict students from traveling and from attending large gatherings. The pandemic is yet to be over, and even when more students are vaccinated, we still need to take various precautions as a large public university to prevent any massive spread of the virus. Most international students, however, have also been suffering from the time differences. They are currently taking classes from their homes, which are thousands of miles aways from Santa Barbara, and thus are often forced to attend lectures in the early mornings. While many professors are understanding and are more lenient toward international students’ live attendance, the Academic Senate and other units of the university should also pass policies encouraging and even requiring such behaviors.

Abigail Merkel,asumi,Off Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162614/abigail-merkel.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,2nd,Political Science,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 73rd senate because I am passionate about advocating for the needs of students at UCSB. Since coming to UCSB as a first year, I have found a home and community in both UCSB and Isla Vista. I have grown to deeply love the university and all it offers, while recognizing the flaws it has. Being involved in the AS Office of the President has made me realize the difference senators can make on and off campus. I plan to truly listen to the needs of students and represent them in the senate, allowing the UCSB administration to hear their voices. My goal is to leave Isla Vista and UCSB a better place when I graduate than when I first came in. I am committed to achieve my goals of financial transparency in AS, help to advocate for our homeless community, and rethink safety in Isla Vista with students so that everyone can see real tangible change occurring. Having lived in the dorms and now in Isla Vista, I feel that I am able to accurately represent the many needs of students and I remain committed to continuously learning and listening from others. ","I am currently the Alumni Affairs Director for the AS Office of the President and I believe this has successfully prepared me to be a senator. I have learned extensively how AS functions, the roles of those who make up AS, and I have had the opportunity to learn from those who have experience. I am confident that my experience in AS will transfer over to working in the senate and will allow me to start working right away for students. As the Alumni Affairs Director, I hosted a week-long panel for alumni speakers and learned the intricacies of working with other groups on campus and how best to reach students. My passion for helping students thrive during undergrad and beyond is something that will absolutely continue as I work as a senator with my constituents in mind. I have also been a member of UCSB’s competitive Mock Trial Team as a competing attorney and as one of their 2020-2021 Co Tournament Directors. I have learned how to balance my classes, work at a local law firm as a legal assistant, and work with a team of dedicated students on Mock Trial. Mock Trial has shown me what it means to be a leader, how to listen to others better, and what it means to accept and implement constructive criticism. As their Tournament Director, I helped host the second biggest undergraduate mock trial tournament on the West Coast, which instilled in me successful organizational and time management skills. I will take these skills with me into the senate as I collaborate with others, learn from those who have different views than me, and work to be efficient for the students we serve. ","As senator, I want to introduce a bill surrounding Title IX and Sexual Assault. I want to create mandatory, yearly, in person informational sessions for every student at UCSB to go through. I believe that with the help and funding of AS, we can better educate students and walk them through the process of Title IX. This would educate students not only on the legality of sexual assault, but also the resources and options survivors have. Modules are easy to skip through and I believe having these sessions in person would be fundamental. I would also like to introduce a resolution in support of our homeless community in Isla Vista, with a focus on funding and resources to help them. I plan to work closely with other senators and ultimately the office of the EVPLA to fully carry this out. Students live peacefully with many other Isla Vista residents and we should take measures to help our neighbors while ensuring safety. Lastly, I would introduce a resolution surrounding the support of releasing the amount of money given to UCPD. I am in support of making this widely known public information and creating town halls with students, administration, and police to reimagine safety in Isla Vista. ","I am running to represent the needs and voices of UCSB students living in Isla Vista. I plan to do this in a multitude of ways, beginning with advocating for the homeless living in Isla Vista. I plan to work closely with the office of the EVPLA and provide those who are houseless with the comprehensive resources needed to better their living conditions, while keeping students safe. I believe students deserve better transparency on what Isla Vista is doing to help the homeless community and should be more aware of ways to help, as well as where their money is going. I also plan to provide complete financial transparency of student fees managed by AS. I am determined to work with other senators so that a monetary quarterly breakdown is posted to students through social media at the end of the quarter. I believe students deserve to know how their money is being spent and this information should be very easily accessible. I also plan to work with the UCSB Administration and UCPD to provide transparency surrounding the funding UCPD receives. I believe students have a right to know how much funding their police department receives, as well as how that money is allocated. I plan to organize town halls and collaborate with students to reimagine safety in Isla Vista. Another goal of mine is to collaborate with UCSB administration to create a widely known plan if there is an active shooter on campus
and advocate for preventative measures to be taken and installed in classrooms. Students deserve to feel safe in large lecture halls and not be worried about safety while trying to receive an education. I also want to assist students with landlord troubles by providing a website with online legal information and people to contact. With this, I want to promote and support IV Tenants Union, which can help students but this is not widely known. Lastly, as senator I want to educate students on what constitutes sexual assault and the Title IX process by holding mandatory, in-person, yearly informational sessions in Isla Vista. I would like to see this personalized for Greek life and club sports, as well as updating it as laws change and the community evolves. ","I hope to work with the office of the EVPLA, IV Tenants Union, AS Legal Resources Center, AS Public Safety Commission, SASA (Students Against Sexual Assault), and the AS Food Bank with the Food Security and Basic Needs Taskforce, to name a few. I believe these organizations and entities are vital in achieving my goals of safety, accessibility, and transparency. ","A large aspect of my platform is transparency and accessibility. I believe that those in AS have an obligation to not only be transparent with their actions and financial spending, but also to be easily accessible to students. Online learning has caused many students, myself included, to feel in the dark about decisions being made in the UCSB administration and in the AS Senate. I hope to help fix this by being easily accessible. I will host Zoom office hours weekly, create an instagram specifically for my position as a senator, and I am committed to responding within 24 hours or less to each email so that all students feel heard. I will ensure that both my Zoom office hours link and email are easily found on my instagram. I will also increase my social media presence on instagram so that students know what I am working on. I also plan to post google forms to my instagram with questions students can answer so I can listen to their needs as the year progresses. I believe google forms is a good way to listen and interact with students virtually and if they choose to add their name, I am committed to following up and making sure each student feels individually heard. ","I believe I am the best candidate for this position because I have previous experience in AS and I also have experience from leadership positions in other organizations. I understand how AS works from firsthand experience, which has allowed me to learn what I hope to change internally in AS and what I plan to continue to support. Having lived on and off campus and having been a part of different organizations, I will represent all of my constituents and not just a small group. Living in Isla Vista during Covid-19 has opened my eyes to the needs of the community and has made me eager to help foster change. During my time at UCSB, I have learned how to adapt, organize and plan, and work with others who have differing opinions than my own. I also am determined and I commit to everything I take on, ensuring that I will be an active member of the senate who contributes to bettering the UCSB campus and the community. My hard work extends beyond the classroom and my extrovert personality allows me to really get to know the students I represent. I am active in my classes and in the Isla Vista community, which I believe will help bridge the gap between student government and the needs of the student body. ",Left-leaning,"Very Good: I believe the 72 A.S. Senate has done a very good job adapting to the challenges of the year, specifically with online learning during the pandemic. They have been successful in showing support for movements such as BLM and opening up Covid-19 grants. However, I believe efficiency has been an issue for a while and this is something I hope to help fix. I also believe being online has given the Senate the perfect opportunity to become more transparent and while this has improved, I am running to make the finances handled by the Senate more accessible. ","No: I do not feel entirely comfortable voicing my opinion on this since I am still learning. As an Off-Campus senator, I represent Isla Vista students and I have a duty to listen to them. I plan to act on the views of my constituents, while standing against violence. BDS is an international issue, which the Senate alone does not have power over. With that being said, currently I do not believe a resolution to divest would achieve the outcome we are looking for, but I am committed and eager to listen and learn so that all students are heard. 
","No: I believe in heavily reducing the cost of higher education and creating regulations, as well as continuing to support low income students so that all students have better access to higher education. UCSB pays for the resources students are able to enjoy, from dedicated professors to keeping the library clean so that students can study during Covid-19. I recognize the importance of this funding but believe the cost of higher education has become unattainable for most. In order for change to be successful, lessening the cost of higher education must be a national conversation. ","I believe that UCSB has many options to improve the mental health of students, however I hope to work with UCSB to advertise them more and increase their capacity. Many students I know have waited long periods of time to get an appointment at CAPS and then once they are in the system they have to wait a while between sessions. With such a large student population, I am determined to advocate for the expansion of these services and to raise awareness about lesser known services such as the Alcohol and Drug Program. I think UCSB does a really great job of reducing the stigma of therapy and reaching out for help surrounding mental health, but it is not easily accessible to students. WIth UCSB being so large, it can be discouraging to try to seek help and be kept waiting for so long. I also plan to work with other senators to expand on UCSB’s Mental Health Town Halls to continue to make the discussion of mental health at UCSB normal. I believe more support for mental health services can be advertised on social media so that students who are on and off campus are aware of their options. ","I think the response to partying in Isla Vista was handled poorly on all ends and it has been very frustrating to watch as a student. As a student living in Isla Vista during the pandemic, guidelines for partying are often not enforced and if they are, the fines given are small. I believe the fine amount should be increased so that students have a financial incentive to stop partying. I also believe that Greek life should face more of a punishment. Many of the parties have been traced back to being affiliated with Greek life and there have been little consequences that the general UCSB student is aware of. If individuals in Greek life continue to host and attend large parties, I would like to see consequences for next year as UCSB reopens. I also believe the student body deserves to be aware of these consequences, in order to know that the UCSB administration is taking action. As senator I plan to work with UCSB administration to review the reporting process of parties so that it is specific to the house and unit. While reporting large parties is helpful, no further action can be taken if the location is too broad. ","I believe that the idea of Title IX is very good and necessary, however there are definite issues with how it functions at UCSB. First off, I disagree with the changes done by Betsy DeVos for Title IX and believe in the regulations and guidelines of the Obama administration. I believe the support for survivors should always be emphasized, beginning with student government and the senate. I also believe students are not aware of the Title IX process and many survivors do not know who or where to turn to. I hope to increase awareness for this process by working with UCSB administration to create yearly, mandatory, in person sessions on sexual assault and the Title IX process. I plan to advocate for and support programs such as CARE to educate students on not just what sexual assault is, but give them options when faced with an issue such as this. I also hope to work with SASA (Students Against Sexual Assault) and the office of the EVPSA to listen to survivors and respond to their needs on a local and statewide level. Sexual assault is
very prevelant on and off campus and I believe this has been a deeply neglected isssue, from education and awareness to the consequences students should face. ","I am not a member of one of these groups and I do not want to speak for them. As senator, I will be committed to learning from different groups and making sure that every student feels safe and accepted on campus at UCSB and in Isla Vista. As a student who is not a member of these groups, I do believe there is awareness and support for them but that as a campus community, we can always do better. I believe the resolutions that the senate passes in support of equality and protection of all students are important for the wellbeing of the community. I would be very interested in learning about the funding given to these groups on campus, meeting with them, and collaborating with them to ensure their voices are heard. I believe that equity is important, especially in terms of funding, so that all students can thrive at UCSB and have the resources to achieve their goals and feel safe. As a senator, I have the responsibility to represent the needs of all my constituents and I am determined to make everyone feel heard. 
","As senator, the first bill I plan to author is to require the Senate to post quarterly monetary breakdowns of AS Senate spending of student fees. I firmly believe in transparency and I would advocate for this to be posted on social media, such as Instagram to ensure it is accessible to all students. This is a platform goal of mine and at the moment, most students do not know how the AS Senate spends their money, which is a big problem. Students cannot fully voice their opinions if they don’t know what goes on in student government. I think creating transparency with our finances would foster good conversation and allow us to reevaluate where we are spending money. ","As referenced above, a main platform of mine is to increase transparency in AS so that students have a clearer idea of what senators and others in AS do and where their fees go. I think it is vital that all senators and all executive offices have an active social media account dedicated to informing students of what they have been doing. I think that this needs to be promoted so that students know where to find this information, starting with the main UCSB instagram alerting students that all AS senators have instagram and tagging the main accounts of AS executive members. Students cannot get involved or be informed if they aren’t aware of AS in the first place. I also am determined to make students aware of how AS handles their fees. A platform point of mine is to release quarterly monetary breakdowns of financial spending in AS as a whole. I believe this should be posted on social media so that there is no question as to how their money is being spent. In my experience, many students are not aware of AS and if they are, they do not know what AS does. I am running as senator to fix this problem so that all students feel informed, heard, and represented in AS. 
","I believe the senate is crucial in getting students back to in-person instruction and ensuring that they have the resources to do so. I would work with other senators to continue and expand our Covid-19 grant, so that all students are not overwhelmed with financial burdens when they return to in-person classes. I also would work with other senators and the office of the EVPLA to expand funding for the AS Food Bank through reallocation of AS funds. I believe tackling food insecurity is a necessity as students return to campus and Isla Vista and I want to work with others in the senate, as well as the Food Security and Basic Needs Taskforce to increase the amount of AS Food Bank pop up shops in Isla Vista. Students should not have to worry about where their next meal is coming from, especially when many have lost jobs and family members during the pandemic. On another note, one of my platform points is to help students know their rights as tenants in Isla Vista. I believe that as students come back to campus and Isla Vista, it is important that they know their rights and are not taken advantage by landlords. I plan to work with the IV Tenants Union and heavily promote their services so that students know how to turn to for information. Many students are not aware of the resources that are available to them and I hope to increase awareness and support for organizations that help students in Isla Vista. ","I think this year has been very challenging for many students, including myself. I believe the university could have done a better job with transparency and keeping students aware of what was happening. Plans for remote learning came abruptly and each quarter that has followed has come with little information. Many students found themselves unsure of how to handle their housing and I firmly believe students deserved more transparency with plans. Lives were changed with little to no information on what the future would look like at UCSB, which can feel frustrating. However, I recognize the uncertainty of the pandemic and understand that while students were eager to have more information, sometimes the administration did not have anything new to announce. On the opposite side, I believe UCSB has succeeded in their
Covid-19 testing capacity, since it is very easy to book an appointment and get tested for free. The results come back in 1-2 days and this has allowed for Isla Vista students to be safe and get tested without paying a fee. With the reopening of different parts of campus such as the library and the gym, I also believe this is a success. I believe UCSB has done relatively well in the uncertainty and professors have been vital in connecting with students and helping them through this difficult time.",,,,,,,

It is incredible to see the strides that our Associated Students have made in the preceding 72 senates, and I am excited to take on the opportunity to benefit our community of students living in Isla Vista and Off-Campus. An important initiative that I hope to implement for UCSB students is the strengthening of career outreach programs. UCSB students struggle with the stress and pressure of transitioning into a full time job coming out of college. From personal experience, and feedback from fellow students, many departments do not provide adequate information regarding our transition to the workforce. I intend to help relieve this stress by working with these departments to give students a comprehensive look at their possible career paths and in providing viable opportunities beyond college. This would be achieved by providing funding for a variety of speaker series from professors and industry professionals that can help inform students of their career opportunities. I would also focus on highlighting all of the career opportunities available to students by bolstering offerings in department newsletters. My ultimate goal is to provide students with as much enjoyment of our time in college as possible, something this past year of pandemic has significantly impacted. I believe that by eliminating career stress and providing proactive support for student’s food and mental health needs, we will all be able to fully embrace great vibes and times going forward. ","One of the core duties of an AS Senator is to appropriately vote for and fund initiatives and organizations that they believe align with the core values of the UCSB students they represent. I have a variety of experiences that have prepared me to succeed in following through on this duty to benefit UCSB students including my past role as a UCSB Housing Representative and my current role as Commissioner of Budget and Finance. I performed this duty in my role as a UCSB Housing Representative by funding social events from student feedback, and learning how to best make progress on my objectives through committees and active involvement with
RA’s. I continued to develop my experience in my role as the Commissioner of Budget and Finance in the AS Office of the President. This role has prepared me for handling the more technical aspect of being a Senator, as I must handle and analyze financial documents going 
through this office. I will use the detail-oriented approach I have learned through this role to best serve off-campus students, making sure that the Senate does not over fund initiatives and organizations, preserving student money and allowing more room for funding other student clubs and ideas. ","My goal is to enable students to make the most of life in Santa Barbara, something this past year of pandemic has significantly impacted. I believe that this can be accomplished by eliminating career stress and providing proactive support for student’s food and mental health needs. The first resolution I intend to introduce to achieve this goal is one targeted in providing funding for a variety of speaker series from professors and industry professionals that can help inform students of their career opportunities. This bill would also focus on highlighting all of the career opportunities available to students through the use of department newsletters. My second resolution would target proactively addressing our student’s mental health. This can be achieved by funding a variety of social and stress-relieving events for students. Students would be able to build their positive mental health through activities such as sunset yoga sessions. My third resolution would seek to emphasize food resources and connect students with our community food banks. I would work to improve social media connection between food banks and students, through continued work such as publishing daily food options. College is often the first time students must fend for themselves to have food available, and providing significant support in this aspect will allow them to worry less about having food to eat, and spend more time enjoying the sun and ocean. ","I am currently running to be an Off-Campus Senator for the 2021-2022 school year with the Storke Party. The Storke Party’s values of transparency and AS accessibility to students resonated with me and are reflected in my platform. I will actively work to make sure my progress is public and will provide a variety of ways to reach me as I work to better our community. I am focusing on several main initiatives that will benefit UCSB students by eliminating career stress and providing proactive support for student’s food and mental health needs. I intend to strengthen outreach programs by informing and connecting UCSB students with job and career opportunities; this will help in assisting students with our vital post-graduation transition. My second goal is to support students affected by food insecurity. I will streamline simple, accessible ways to obtain basic needs resources from the AS Food Bank and Miramar Food Pantry. Lastly, I will emphasize mental health initiatives and events around Isla Vista by providing proactive mental health resources to help students develop healthy mindfulness practices. I plan on collaborating with the Student Mental Health Task Force to put on social and stress-relieving events that will help achieve this objective. I believe these values align with our Associated Student’s mission to support and enable UCSB students to succeed. They help students achieve a solid mental and physical basis, with accessible mental health resources and food options, along with positive future outlook with a greater understanding of career possibilities and opportunities. ","I understand that the role of an Off-Campus Senator is extremely collaborative, where change necessitates teamwork with various entities to mutually achieve my platform and their own objectives. I intend to open myself up to collaboration by learning as much as I can about the broad expanse of AS entities within my role, and to apply myself to those which I can help the most. I believe that I can collaborate with the AS Department of Worms to improve sustainability around UCSB. It is becoming increasingly evident that it is the responsibility of every individual in our generation to preserve and protect the planet we are living on. My goal is to work with the Department of Worms to expand their on-campus composting services into public areas around Isla Vista. This would allow for students to have accessible and simple ways to compost and contribute to a cycle of composting food scraps, using those food scraps to grow more food, and then composting the scraps of the newly grown food. By proactively working to increase funding and manpower for this organization, we will all be able to make a difference in reducing food waste. I will also partner with the Miramar Food Pantry and AS Food Bank to connect them with a broader student body, and help UCSB students receive basic groceries and supplies for free. This can be done with a focus on social media outreach and an increased support of these programs in the AS government. ","A core value of my platform is my accessibility to students and organizations on campus. I understand that it is the job of a Senator to appropriately represent UCSB students, and this can only be possible if they enable and are open to receiving a variety of feedback. I will enable students to reach out to me via social media platforms such as Instagram, where this connection can easily transpire into a discussion. I intend to vacate spots of time to have these discussions with students, and will actively work to fill these times by reaching out to organizations and students who are willing to talk. I strongly believe that change comes from proactive action, this belief will lead me to proactively work with students and clubs on campus to achieve their
objectives and benefit our community. With the coming year of instruction still being somewhat uncertain, I will be available through Zoom, FaceTime, or any online video calling platform that works best to meet. If possible, I will also be available to meet face to face. I love coffee, and love to chat over coffee even more. Coffee can be substituted for breakfast sandwiches if needed. Connecting with UCSB students and organizations is extremely important to me, and I will make myself available in whichever facet is possible in order to do this. ","It is my understanding that being an AS Senator requires several distinct qualities. These would include strong collaborative skills in order to effectively work with organizations and students at UCSB, empathy: it is important for a Senator to be capable of connecting with the experiences of their fellow students, and a strong work ethic in order to achieve the goals and ideas of clubs and students at UCSB. I have these distinct qualities, and believe they will allow me to succeed as an Off-Campus Senator for the 2020-21 school year. I have actively demonstrated my empathy in my work to become a Mental Health and Wellness Peer at UCSB. I want to be a valuable outlet and support for my friends and fellow students now and going into the future. I have developed and demonstrated my strong work ethic and collaborative skills in my role within the Office of the Controller, consistently working with business analysts to achieve a variety of projects to benefit AS entities. I can also say that these qualities have been honed in my time as a housemate to 9 other individuals living in Isla Vista this past year. The communication and gradual understanding of everyone’s priorities has taught me a lot about incorporating a variety of perspectives into my daily activities. I believe anyone who has lived with other people can attest to the lessons learned through this experience. ",Left-leaning,"Good:  I can not speak on the entirety of issues and funding that the 72nd Senate has dealt with in the past year; however, I would like to commend the Senate on their establishment of a COVID 19 Task Force and their continued support of UCSB students through the funding of plane tickets, groceries, rent, etc. that has helped us through this pandemic. 
","No: From further research into this issue, I do not believe the BDS movement aptly affects or addresses the extent of conflicts dating back hundreds of years between Israel and Palestine. 
","Yes: Yes, the accessibility of higher education regardless of economic status would be of great benefit to our society. I have met a number of individuals that must work a job alongside their education in order to pay for tuition. While the feasibility of UCSB being tuition-free is complicated, I believe it is important to take steps to ease the financial burden of obtaining education on all students at our school. 
","Assisting and providing a support structure for student’s mental health is an important issue for me. This past year, I personally struggled with deteriorating mental health, an experience that many students might relate to over the various quarters of online/social-distance learning we have gone through while in quarantine. UCSB has funding and organizations such as CAPS which work to provide a support structure for struggling students, and UCSB’s initiative to establish a Mental Health Task Force demonstrates their recognition that our mental health is important, and can significantly impact our studies and lives. Now, our mental health is often
only considered when it is at a low point and requires a reactive approach such as therapy. It is my goal to work with the Mental Health Task Force at UCSB to proactively address student’s mental health this coming year. By actively putting on social and stress relieving events for students, many people can proactively work for positive mental health. I believe by connecting our community we can further a proactive approach to keeping positive mental health in addition to the more reactive services currently available. I also believe that there are many different perspectives on what proactively approaching mental health could look like, and hope to hear from many students about their ideas regarding different events we can fund! ","As a member of the UCSB student body, I saw the multiple allegations brought to the university and shared on social media concerning large parties being hosted by Greek Life. I also remember a large influx of cases in Isla Vista being tracked back to one of these parties. It was frustrating to see the seemingly continued violations of social distancing protocols and their connection to outbreaks in our community, and yet see a very passive response from the university. In this sense, the university did handle the situation properly. From my perspective, the university would benefit from handling the situation on a 2 strikes basis, where reports of a large party being held would lead to a strike, and 2 strikes would lead to probation. This balances a strict set of guidelines with a small degree of lenience for these organizations, as we must take into consideration that the information we have now about COVID was not always present. In regards to culpable individuals, I do not think the university has the right or ability to punish these persons on a case to case basis. Beyond Greek life, many students were still inclined to party despite the restrictions, and the risks and responsibilities of them doing this were shared by their friends and family they came into contact with. ","I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office as well as its CARE program. These offices exist in order to provide emotional and legal support for survivors of sexual assault at our school. I stand with Senate’s resolution to “believe the survivors of sexual assault”, and intend to proactively work with the IV Community Services District and UCSB to confront a culture of sexual assualt head on through in depth and continuing education on sex and consent. There is a general misconception that allegations may be used to slander an individual’s reputation, a
misconception that ignores the intense guilt and emotional trauma that affects survivors. The weight of accusing someone of sexual assault carries a lot of responsibility and guilt in survivors, where a portion of survivors will never come forward with allegations. I intend to continue learning how to be the best ally possible to survivors of sexual assault. We stop a culture of sexual assault by addressing it head on, initiating programs of continued education on what consent dictates for all years of college students. I believe we can continue tackling this issue on college campuses by instilling harsh consequences for offenders and believing survivors regarding sexual assault. 
","I strongly believe that our progression as a society comes from the establishment of equality on economic and social fronts for all historically underrepresented groups. We can enact this at our university through a dedication to supporting and serving members of the Black, Latinx, Indigeneous, and LGBTQ+ communities through fiscal tuition support and broad funding for a variety of programs and clubs that help give these underrepresented groups a solid identity at UCSB. Do I believe UCSB is effectively doing this? I can not be entirely sure, I am straight and white, and recognize that I will not fully understand the breadth of the situation as would someone who comes from these historically underrepresented groups. It is this recognition that drives me to continuously work to be an ally for these groups and their objectives; this ranges from marching for social change with the Black Lives Matter movement to a focus on identifying my pronouns, helping normalize freedom of gender identity and expression. I intend to work with these underrepresented groups to pass funding that benefits our community. My perspective on the world comes from my experiences; understanding this, I will always strive to learn and embrace other’s perspectives since I believe them to be equally true and valuable. ","I believe that it is extremely important for members of the AS Senate to actively promote change and action within the assembly so as to better serve our students. An important initiative that I hope to implement for UCSB students is the strengthening of career outreach programs. UCSB students struggle with the stress and pressure of transitioning into a full time job coming out of college. From personal experience, and feedback from fellow students, many departments do not provide adequate information regarding our transition to the workforce. I intend to help relieve this stress by working with these departments to give students a comprehensive look at their possible career paths and in providing viable opportunities beyond college. My ultimate goal is to provide students with as much enjoyment of our time in college as possible, something this
past year of pandemic has significantly impacted. I believe that by eliminating career stress and providing proactive support for student’s food and mental health needs, we will all be able to fully embrace great vibes and times going forward. I would seek to find other Senators to co-author this bill with, collaborating with L&S Senators to help create a better environment for UCSB students. ","I think this is an important question, as my experience getting into and working with AS has mirrored the issues of inaccessibility and lack of transparency that are detailed here. I chose to run with the Storke Party due to our shared beliefs that our Associated Student Government should be providing the student body with as much information and access to our government as possible, so as to best represent the needs of our community. To work on accessibility, I believe that this comes from the establishment and publication of a centralized website page to reach out to AS Senators and view their current projects. This will help increase the flow of feedback from students and hold Senators accountable for taking action to initiate change within their role. I also intend to work with programs such as the newly founded Pearman Fellows to create accessible entries to AS positions for students of all years and department. Students who want to become involved in AS will have the ability to do so! To increase transparency, I believe that summarized minutes of AS meetings, omitting sensitive information, could be published. The AS Senate would in turn be held accountable as a whole for appropriately funding programs and clubs that are needed at UCSB at their meetings, and I think this could help reduce drama or issues that rise up within the Senate, in turn focusing on serving the different organizations and groups that make up our school. 
","As a Senator, I would actively work with the administration at UCSB and our External VP of Local Affairs to aid in the transition back to in-person instruction. I understand that a variety of factors will affect the school’s decision, many that are out of our control, however working within the school’s decision, I will work to improve conditions and life for students in whatever form of instruction we return to. This may come with appropriating more funding for student support through the COVID 19 Task Force, or working with a variety of other clubs and organizations to safely hold meetings and connect members with one another. It is important to me that we learn from this past year, and focus on connecting and building friendships in whichever medium is possible. I am passionate about reestablishing a sense of community in Isla Vista and at UCSB, where students feel comfortable asking others for help or guidance, and no person feels helpless or alone. I believe working to make sure that this is possible in whichever form of instruction that we return to will be valuable and beneficial for UCSB students in this coming year. It has been a long year of social distancing, I have my fingers crossed that we will all be able to return to a new normal next school year. ","There are many ways that I have seen our university succeed and fail within this past year in regards to the coronavirus pandemic and remote instruction. Evidently, this pandemic was not something that anyone could have predicted in terms of its length and severity, and so I commend our university, our professors, our TA’s, and our UCSB staff for their work to ensure as best of an education as possible given the circumstances. That being said, the quality of education was poor. I found that remote instruction, while convenient, struggled to teach effectively and find a balance of work. I applaud the university for its flexibility, asynchronous instruction allowed many students to find time for schoolwork around their schedules, and it was fairly satisfying having full control over daily activities. Now, this instruction still struggled with balancing workload, as classes varied between little to no workload and hours spent daily studying and completing assignments. This imbalance made it hard to appropriately study, and often left me with a skewed perspective on my classes. I hope that with the return of in-person instruction, a balanced workload will return, allowing us to focus and get the most out of the courses we are taking. As we seemingly are coming closer to this pandemic’s end, I look forward to learning from the ups and downs that this year has provided, and hope that we all can gain a new appreciation for the in-person friendships and classes that we have ahead of us.",,,,,,,
Coltin Sanders,asumi,Off Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14165238/coltin-sanders.jpg,,He/Him/His,1st,Biology and Political Science,,," I have always been politically active since I was 12 knocking door to door with my undeveloped hands and asking for people to vote in someone I believed would make a change. My home district however is painfully one-sided and my efforts for the past 7 years felt in vain. I want to be a Senator representing the off-campus students of UCSB to create the change I wanted to see in my hometown, right here in my new home. If I am your senator I will fight for increased environmental sustainability policies, outreach programs for different support services UCSB provides, and increase funding for services most in use. I also understand the plight facing most of the freshman class who have only experienced our incredible university through a computer screen. I know how depressing and isolating that can feel and understand that this leads to dangerous mental health problems. I will fight for the expansion of CAPS funding and mental health advocacy. I love this school, and I love Isla Vista and if you decide to elect me, I promise you I will fight for you. ",I have sadly not been a part of any Isla Vista or on campus organizations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ,"If I was granted the honor by the off-campus students of UCSB to represent them, you can bet I would introduce more than just three bills while in office to solve the issues that off-campus students face. However, I have noticed issues with our university that are especially prevalent and if I could only tackle three issues I would ensure the following got done. UCSB is special in that if there is a problem that is facing students many of them can be solved by different programs the university has in place. If a student in Isla-Vista or on-campus is food insecure we have free food pantries in several locations. If a student has mental health care needs we have therapeutic services offered via CAPS. If a student is having issues with their landlord and trying to get their security deposit back they can contact the Isla Vista Tenants Union and receive advice and guidance on how to deal with their landlords. The issue with UCSB isn’t our lack of support services but rather our lack of educational outreach for these services as most people don’t know of the services that can solve the issues they face. The expansion of educational outreach efforts will be priority number 1 for me. Environmental sustainability is one of my other main passions. When I am your senator I will fight for increased funding for sustainability initiatives as well as an expansion of such programs. One of those would be creating different composting sites in Isla Vista and providing any home in Isla Vista that wants a composting bin to drop off your green waste at such sites. The last and favorite of my goals would be to fund a climate labeling program with the on-campus markets, and hopefully the Isla Vista markets. A climate label will tell you exactly how much greenhouse gases were released in the production of the good that the label is on. This would bring the climate crisis back into the front of people’s minds and act as a model for other universities and other communities in the United States to do the same and educate their citizens on which foods and products have the biggest climate impact. ","If my platform was boiled down to three words it would be sustainability, outreach, and cooperation. Two of my biggest goals when I am your senator will be to bolster existing sustainability efforts as well as create new programs to further our population’s ability to live sustainably. I will do this by increasing funding for existing programs and I will create new programs by working with sustainability groups on and off campus to create a more sustainable Isla Vista. To do this I will expand composting programs, by working with the Isla Vista Composting Collective and the local officials of Isla Vista. I will work with them to create several composting sites and food waste collection sites so that the food waste of Isla Vista can be turned into compost. To further sustainability as I previously stated I want to create a carbon labeling program. I will commission a research group to find out exactly how much CO2 and other greenhouse gases will be emitted. Beyond sustainability I will fight for transparency in AS. If given the honor of being your next Senator I will work with my peers to schedule out times where we can host town hall meetings so that we can answer your questions and hear your concerns. I will also make sure that those meetings will be properly advertised so that you know to attend. Beyond that I will be in open communication with the Daily Nexus and be open and willing to answer any questions so that the readers of this publication are aware of the goings-on of the Senate. I will also fight to fund outreach efforts for student support programs so that every student that has an issue that can be addressed by support programs can get the help they need. ","I will work with whichever sustainability groups I can in order to make my sustainability goals possible. I plan on reaching out to the Isla Vista Compost Collective, the Isla Vista Food Co-op, and any other sustainability group that is willing to work with AS to bolster composting in IV, and start a carbon labeling program in stores on and off campus. I will also work with all of the AS boards to figure out the best way to properly fund education programs for outreach programs for student support services.","I really hope that it does not come to that for the 2021-2022 school year and that every student can come back and attend in person classes and take advantage of all the on campus resources especially since we are paying for them. But if remote instruction remains in the 2021-2022 school year I will make sure to make my constituents aware of the public forum part of the weekly Senate meetings to empower my constituency to stand up for themselves to the entire Senate body. I will also be completely available on social media to be reached out to with any concerns, and hold weekly Instagram live sessions where I can answer constituency questions and hear concerns. I will also push for more town halls and public forums to be held by the Senate body so that the AS Senate can hear your concerns. I understand how important it is to be heard and seen by the person representing you, and I understand the immense frustration that can be felt when you are not being heard. I promise you that if you give me the honor of representing you I will prioritise accessibility of myself and the AS Senate as a whole. ","I am the best candidate for this position because I understand the frustration of what not being properly represented looks like. For years I have been involved in the local politics of my hometown of Roseville, CA. There we are represented by Tom McClintock, the 4th most partisan member of Congress, and a deeply conservative man. McClintock does not believe that climate change is real, he believes that immigrants and children should be turned away at the border, and that I as a gay man should not be allowed to marry another man. I fought for years to get this man out of office. In this most recent election cycle I worked with the Brynne Kennedy For Congress campaign, as the Director of the fellowship program where I oversaw 28 fellows/interns. I trained each of my fellows in how to engage in proper, productive political discourse, and how to change the mind of someone who doesn’t agree with you. In other words my political and communications skills were deemed good enough to train the largest team on that campaign. I also was able to manage that team while working 20 hours a week at my father’s restaurant and being a full time student at UCSB. I believe that my work and experience when it comes to the skills required of an AS Senator speaks for itself. I only hope that you see it the same way I do. ",Left-leaning,Good,"I feel like this issue is beyond the scope of my potential power and station as a UCSB Senator. This is an incredibly nuanced and complicated situation, and I can not say that I am well versed in Middle Eastern politics enough to answer Yes or No. Therefore I will not.",Yes,"I do believe that UCSB mental health services are adequate, but do I believe that UCSB should have just an adequate mental health services program? Absolutely not. We should be a shining example of a university that properly cares for its students and provides students with free unlimited access to mental health services, with consistent outreach and mental health awareness programs. In order to increase the quality of mental health services I would fight for increased funding in CAPS. This would accompany greater oversight of the CAPS budget and making sure that the extra funding is going to programs that need more support such as counseling and mental health awareness and outreach. I would make sure that every student is fully aware that if they are facing a mental health issue that they can and should reach out for help. UCSB is one of the best universities in the country, with an amazing reputation of being one of the happiest universities in the nation. We should never settle for an “adequate” mental health care service because the students deserve better than that. If our mental health is suffering we can not learn, and if we can’t learn then why are we even here?",I absolutely do think that the university should have taken more responsibility for the actions of UCSB affiliated groups like fraternities and sororities. If these groups are not acting responsibly during the pandemic that forced us to suffer through online instruction then they must face consequences. Put simply the minimal fines that are put on the Greek houses that throw parties as well as other campus affiliated groups should not be the only punishment that they face. These groups are harming the reputation of UCSB and making our beloved school look incredibly irresponsible and unaware of the pandemic that is plaguing the United States. Such transgressions taken by university affiliated groups should warrant investigation from UCSB administration and if found guilty of breaking social distancing protocols the groups in question should lose their campus affiliation or the Greek house should face severe fines. I do not believe that the students themselves should be expelled from the university or face intense fines. However I do believe that individuals should face other non-monetary forms of punishment such as community service. ,Sexual assault is an incredibly important issue that AS must challenge. If given the honor of being your next Senator I will always stand on the side of survivors and believe the students who say they have been assaulted. I will fight for increased funding for different support services offered for the recovery (mentally and physically) of sexual assault survivors. I will also support all educational outreach initiatives to support prevention efforts for sexual assault. However I must admit I am a mere first year and do not quite understand the full scope to which sexual assault and Title IX issues are prevalent at our university. However I promise that I will learn more about this issue and how I can contribute to the extensive work already being done on this issue.,"I can proudly claim that I am a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Specifically I identify with the letter G. Being a part of this community I understand what it feels like to be historically underrepresented and have felt that frustration first hand. I feel fortunate to feel properly represented by my community. I see how hard UCSB’s RCSGD has been working to foster that environment and am so grateful that I can walk around Isla Vista with a rainbow shirt on and feel safe in this community. While I feel like I have been properly represented by UCSB as a gay  man I do not feel like I can speak to the experience of the BIPOC community on and off campus as I am white along with being gay. I can promise though that I will actively listen to the BIPOC community, and fight and advocate for them as I can relate to some extent to their struggle as a repressed minority. I will fund education efforts and minority- focused student groups, and actively listen to my BIPOC constituents and their needs and fight for them to feel properly represented. ","If I am given the honor to serve as your next Senator the first bill that I will author will be a bill to increase funding for educational outreach initiatives, so that the programs that can help Gauchos fulfill their needs can actually reach the Gauchos that need help. As of right now we have countless different student support services that are being funded directly by student fees, whether it by our CAPS program for mental health, the food pantries for food insecure students, or CLAS services for school help to name a few. AS has been working hard for years to establish these different services to solve the litany of problems that students face. However students don’t know that these programs can help exist. That is why when I am your next Senator I will author a bill that increases funding to student support services, specifically for outreach services, so that students who need help know how to get help.","A.S. is commonly seen as way too inaccessible to the average student and that causes discomfort and concern with many different students at this school. If given the honor I would work with my fellow Senators to increase transparency. One of the ways I would do this would be by advertising our Senate meetings public forum section (held at every meeting every Wednesday) more broadly to the general student population. I would do this so that students who want to actively engage and get their problems solved with help from AS know that they can easily make their voices heard to the entire Senate body. I would work with local student news sources such as Nexus and answer any question that they might ask me about what the Senate is currently working on. Personally I will make sure to hold Instagram live sessions once a week to answer questions that my constituents might have about my legislative platform or to hear from constituents about pressing issues they might be facing. I will pressure my fellow senators to do the same.
","If you give me the honor of being your Senator I will listen to the local health officials and public health efforts on the best way possible to reopen the school and work my hardest to make sure that a reopening effort happens as safely and swiftly as possible. I will also fight to make sure that only students who have been vaccinated are allowed on campus.With the vaccine becoming increasingly available this accessibility should not be an issue. I will fight for an online option for each class the first quarter that campus is open to be available to students. In such a massive transition back to normalcy not every student would potentially be able to make it back to Isla Vista or campus so rapidly, they might have jobs or new duties at home that they became responsible for. This pandemic has gone on for so long that it has become the new normal. Many students are still back in their hometowns and have jobs and new responsibilities as a result of this pandemic. It would be irresponsible to not give these students ample time to figure out what their new normal will look like with in person instruction. That is why we need to provide an online option during the first quarter with in person instruction. This is the only way to make sure that the reopening process is fair and equitable. ",I know that the pandemic has hit all of us hard in many different ways as well as the university administration. We are suffering through an unprecedented crisis that hardly had an instruction book available for how university should run through such an event. I believe that the university administration tried their best in this situation to provide us with a quality education. However I don’t think they did a successful job at it. We have been faced with a low quality online education where communication with our peers and teachers has been significantly reduced. Teachers are put into an uncomfortable setting for themselves where very few of them have actually gotten the hang of online teaching and teach in the same manner as they did in person regardless of the general current situation and students’ individual needs and concerns. All of this tied with the fact that all of our campus services and other programs that UCSB generally provides to us is no longer easily accessible is depressing. But when all of that is taken into account the university still did not lower our tuition. Every student is paying for the UCEN and other services despite the fact that we haven’t had access to them in a year. Countless students face economic uncertainty from this pandemic and yet the university still opted to rob their students and claim that they were offering services that no student had access to. The university in short failed the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and remote instruction.,,,,,,,
David Gjerde,sindhu,Off Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162725/david-gjerde.jpg,,He/Him/His,1st,Economics,,,"I’ve had a great year getting to know my fellow Gauchos! But, like many of you, I’ve felt that my tuition dollars have not been working for me this year. We are paying the same tuition for substantially reduced services, and many times we are unaware where our student fees end
up. With my background in leadership, I hope to voice the concerns of those excited to get back to UCSB, as well as those who have never stepped foot on campus.
I want to be a part of the 72nd Senate to reallocate student fees to accelerate our return to
campus. With an extraordinary budget of around $15 million, I believe that this process is best
done with full transparency. Over the past year, budget rollovers and wasteful expenditures could have been used in bills that target resources for reopening school next year. As a Senator I woulddo everything in my power to make sure that students feel that their student fees are working for them, and I am excited to take on the challenge in the year ahead of us.","This year I joined AS as a Fellow for the Zero Waste Committee. In ZWC, I have been
connecting with eco-minded peers and working to make our school a more sustainable place. I
worked closely with the committee’s budgeting and considered grants for local leaders for their
own sustainability projects. Additionally, I collaborated with multiple AS entities- COSWB,
CAB, CMG, and ZWC- on an ongoing project to deliver care packages to students, especially
food and basic-needs insecure students. Because of this year's toll on our community, this project
was important to me so that we can work to redistribute student fees back to our most vulnerable
members.
In High School I led prominent leadership positions that I believe helped me develop the skills to
listen to the community and respond with effective solutions. I served as a Team Captain for my
swim team, as well as Treasurer for my Mock Trial team. I’ve taken these skills with me to
UCSB, and I’m ready to further engage with my classmates to tackle the challenging year ahead
of us and find solutions that work for all students.","While in office, I’d like to first introduce a bill to place a reduction in student fees on the ballot.
This year, while students have been paying the same tuition that is likely to increase next year,
we have been offered substantially reduced services. Unused facilities on campus are still being
counted towards our tuition and student fees as operating costs, and I believe that this has led
students to bear the financial burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to empower students to
make the decisions on how their tuition works for them, so this is one of the first things I would
do as a Senator. To supplement this action, I would use my position to Lobby for reduced tuition,
as well as work closely with the standing Committee on Finance and Business to increase
transparency on unused AS funds and their allocation.
Then, I’d like to reallocate student funds to expand existing COVID-19 grants. The 71st Senate
has done a good job in using the COVID-19 Task Force to help reinvest student fees back into
the community during these challenging times, but I believe we could go further in our financial
aid to the community.
Then, I’d also like to use remaining funds to bolster the Basic Needs Committee. This year,
while working on care packages for basic-needs insecure students, I have realized the potential
for a larger, better-funded project. With the creation of a new Basic Needs Committee, I would
pass a bill to expand this Committee's ability and reach more students in our community.","My platform is all about doing everything in my power as a Senator to REINVEST and REOPEN. I want to make sure that students feel that their tuition and student fees are working for them, and not just for the university and AS. My first platform point is reinvesting student fees back into the community, especially our most vulnerable students including food and basic-needs insecure people. I’ve gotten started on this project this year by working to distribute care packages which include food coupons and eco-friendly basic products like masks and food containers. However, I want to finish this project in the senate by providing unused funds for other care package options and expanding existing basic-needs programs. I would stand against any unnecessary increase in Honoraria, because Ibelieve that these funds are needed in other, more crucial areas, such as funding resources for reopening.
Another goal of mine is to work within the Senate, as well as using my position to communicate with the university, to demand transparency in student fee and tuition usage. Students have the right to know exactly where their money is going, and this year expenditures have been complicated due to the pandemic.","Specifically, I would like to work with or within the Finance and Business Committee, a standing Committee open to Senators. This committee is responsible for streamlining the budgetary process in AS, and I believe that I could work with FBC to educate and bring transparency to AS fund usage. Working in this committee would let me see more clearly where funds are ending up, and I would work to educate my constituents on how their fees are being handled. I want to continue to work with the Zero Waste Committee in advancing our campuses goal towards zero waste. There is so much important work to be done on the sustainability front: from installing more zero waste facilities like water stations to expanding local sustainability projects. I also want to work with the Basic Needs Standing Committee to continue my goal in reinvesting students’ fees for our most vulnerable members. I believe that my previous experience would allow me to work efficiently in this committee, and I think there is a lot of work to do to ensure everyone in our community has access to basic needs.
Lastly, I want to work on the Committee on Honoraria to prevent any unnecessary increases in payments to students in AS. I value the work being done by so many people to make our campus a better place, but I want to make sure that there are no unmerited hikes so that we can better focus our resources on reinvesting back to the community.","If remote instruction continues during my term for the 2021-2022 school year, I want to make
sure that not only am I accessible through zooms, email, and social media, but I want to make it
fun and engaging to connect with your Senators! I think it would be fun to host a series of social
events, such as watch parties, Zoom Happy Hours, and lunch chats. Part of increasing
transparency in AS comes with the actual engagement and connection with the constituents,
something I think can only be accomplished through inviting and welcoming online events.
Additionally, I would like to use social media to the best of my advantage by posting accessible
and understandable information guides on Senate resolutions, bills, and agendas. After each
senate meeting, I would like to use social media to share what exactly went on to reach out to
everyone who was unable to attend. Senate sessions themselves are largely inaccessible because
of their length, the language used, as well as the lack of context for a student new to AS. Next
year, I want to be as engaging as possible to increase transparency in the Senate.","Being new to AS, I have a fresh perspective on our community’s strengths, as well as a new
mindset to overcome our challenges. There are so many things I have been impressed with this
year. For one, we have an amazing and accepting community, and so many of us want to make
our school, and our world, a better place. This is something I realized by not only getting
involved with AS this year, but it has also come with meeting so many of you on zoom for class
or just for fun. I have never been on campus, and this has given me insight on the invaluable- and
intangible- strength of our community.
I also have a fresh perspective on how we can overcome our challenges. I’m not focused on the
glossy and easy work of some proposals, rather, I am most interested in having a seat at the table
and asking the questions that matter for our students and our financial considerations. I am
focused on results, and I am ready to get to work!",Left-leaning,"Fair  -- Given the difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe 72nd AS Senate responded to the crisis adequately. However, most of the resolutions passed by the body have no real teeth other than communicative power, and I believe there could have been more substantial bills passed for community recovery.","Honestly, I’m currently uneducated on this topic and want to learn more about it as well as the student body’s opinions on the matter. Like any conversation, I think it is best to listen before I speak.","No -- While I think tuition should be reduced so that students do not bear the financial burden of the
COVID-19 pandemic, UCSB would have a difficult time offering effective services to students if we were tuition free. Our community, and our potential, all need real resources.","It has been a tough year for everyone mentally, and many students are experiencing unhealthy levels of stress as well as worsened mental health problems. While I believe many of the services
that UCSB offers are adequate, many students, especially first years and transfers who have
never been on campus, have a dramatic lack of knowledge on what these services are and what
exactly they offer. Services like Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), UCSB Student
Well Being, and Committee on Student Wellbeing (COSWB) are doing some great work in coordinating and finding ways to tackle mental health issues during these particularly challenging times. These organizations have been resilient in finding ways to connect with
students virtually, however I believe that many students are unaware that these resources exist.
From the perspective of a first year student that has also found this year mentally taxing, I had
never heard of these resources until I did some research, nor would it have even occurred to me
to go to my school for mental help. Because everything is online, it's hard to feel like these
services are reliably there for you. As a senator, I would do everything in my power to educate
my constituents on these services, as well as being transparent on any costs these services might
have. Many students do not know if these services are free, available, helpful, or useful, so I
would use my position to advocate for transparency in mental health services as well as spread
awareness for students to get the help they need.","Organizations in our community have failed to hold their members accountable for their
behavior. As cases surged in Isla Vista and Santa Barbara County became the fastest growing COVID hotspot in California, large parties hosted and attended by organizations likely contributed significantly to the local spread of illness. Going forward, these groups need to be punished by the university to incentivize safer precautions and the wellbeing of our community.
While it is easy to point fingers at individual party goers- and I do believe individuals should be held accountable for the decisions they make- groups and organizations are just as responsible for creating a culture where partying is acceptable and breaking social distancing measures are unpunishable. Organizations need to hold their members accountable to change the culture of patrying in Isla Vista, and in order to do this these groups should be fined if their members and leaders organize parties.
Additionally, property owners have inadequately responded to tenants that violate local COVID-19 ordinances. Landlords and property managers that profit from our community who fail to oversee destructive behavior should be fined.","Learning to prevent sexual abuse is a long-term project for our community. In order to raise awareness and educate on the sign of abuse, I believe that courses should be an ongoing process for undergraduate students. Instead of a single 30-minute course taken at the beginning of freshmen year, students should be reevaluated on their knowledge on the prevention and identification of abuse. The courses should be engaging and showcase real-world situations so
that students do not just ignore them. Survivors should also have a moment to share their experiences in coping with abuse, so that our community can see first-hand the human toll of assault. This should also serve as a moment to reflect for our community on how we treat survivors and their stories, and how we can better prevent assault in the future. Additionally, I would use my platform to empower the voices of survivors and invite survivors to share their stories. I believe that conversations about abuse should be focused and led by survivors of sexual abuse and assault, and by giving survivors my platform I would hope to advance the conversation in new ways.","As a Queer student, I’ve been impressed with the resources and accepting community available to me and my allies. Overall, I have felt extremely comfortable reaching out to my peers when I have had issues, and I feel like my professors have made me feel safe and wanted in class. In the 71st A.S senate, I have been impressed with the resolutions passed this year that stand firmly with the BIPOC and LGBT communities. This year has been especially painful for marginalized communities- the killings of Black men and women through excessive use of police force, the recent rise in Asian hate crimes, especially in California, the separation of undocumented peoples and the ongoing crises on our southern border, and many other instances of racial violence- and while Senate resolutions that display solidarity to these communities are a step in the right direction, I believe we can go further to show support for historically underrepresented groups in our community. For one, our community can do more to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Isla Vista, which disproportionately devastates communities of color and lower income individuals. The party culture that has led to a death and countless illnesses in Isla Vista is largely responsible for damaging some of these vulnerable communities.
Additionally, I believe the Senate can do more than pass resolutions to show solidarity, because these resolutions lack real enforcement power over our community. I believe that marginalized communities need more tangible resources, and they would be better served by bills. As a Senator, I would use my position to stand firmly with marginalized communities as well asfinding tangible solutions to improve our community.","The first bill I would author would be to start a commission to investigate wasteful and unused
expenditures, and for the commission to make recommendations on where funds should be
reallocated. Reopening is a top goal for most students, and by targeting AS funds for reopening I
believe that we can get the most out of student fees. I would like to start the conversation on
being transparent with the effectiveness of where funds are being used, and I hope that this
conversation would ultimately lead to a clear definition of our priorities as a Senate. In my
opinion, because reopening is going to take so much money, time, and effort from every Senator,
Professor, and student, I believe that efficiently allocating the funds we have is the first step
towards getting back to normal without increasing the financial burden on students.","When I talk to my friends, most of them do not know how much money AS has, what AS is
focused on now, and how AS is conducting itself during remote instruction. This is because AS
is largely inaccessible to students, especially to first years and transfers who have never been on
campus. As a senator, I would make sure that my constituents have a seat at the table and that
they are educated on what AS is doing with their student fees.
For one, I would like to create reader friendly versions of every senate meeting, bill, resolution,
and agenda item that would be easily displayed on my social media accounts. This would go
beyond meetings and the infrequent infographics, because it would be regularly scheduled and
include context for every item. Senate meetings can last up to hours long, and ordinary students
are usually too busy with their personal and academic lives to investigate what every item means.
By recapping everything of importance done in the Senate, I would like to spark conversations
among students so they can be more involved in AS.","It is no surprise that reopening school and returning to the classroom is the single most important
goal for students, and I am ready to start working on this challenge. Through fund reallocation,
social distancing messaging, and resource implementation, I believe we can get back to a safer,
better-prepared campus for the 2021-2022 school year.
First, funds need to be reallocated to specifically target reopening facilities on campus.
Reopening requires money, and the budget rollovers and wasteful expenditures should instead be
redirected to securing some of the many resources we are going to need to safely reopen. These
resources range from indoor ventilation, masks, as well as technological resources in the case
that fall quarter has hybrid instruction. As a Senator, I would like to start a commission to find
where funds can be reallocated from, as well as what facilities do not make sense to focus on so
that we can better target our resources.
Additionally, reopening takes cooperation from the community. As a Senator, I would continue
to support social distancing and mask usage, as well as create bills to offer incentives for
students to follow these guidelines. If the community works together and takes these precautions,
transition into in person instruction would happen faster and easier.
In my opinion, reopening is going to take smart reallocation, messaging, and reinvestment. As a
Senator, I am eager to get back to campus and do everything in my power to take charge of this
goal.","So far, UCSB has not met the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. A complete lack of
transparency in reopening and student fee and tuition usage, as well as other shortcoming from
the university has rightly left many UCSB students frustrated and drained.
The lack of transparency in reopening has been startling. To many of my peers, the anticipation
of in person instruction and the delayed announcements of reopening plans has been a whiplash
of hope and frustration with the university. Even in 2021, UCSB has yet to release clear and
direct plans and criteria for reopening as well as any commitments to the community. The
message has been nearly the same since the beginning of the pandemic: we don’t know. While
UCSB has firmly opposed any reduction in tuition for a full year of remote instruction, they have
yet to release a clear and detailed review of our tuition usage as well as the money that is not
being used by closed on-campus facilities. As a Senator, I want to use my position to demand
transparency from the university.
UCSB has started to do some things right. After following in the footsteps of many UC
campuses, UCSB has started to offer regular COVID-19 tests to asymptomatic and unexposed
students, a key step towards getting our campus reopened. I believe that UCSB does not have to
lag behind other UC campuses and universities, and as a Senator I would demand transparency
as well as support smart reallocation of resources targeted at reopening campus. Let's do this,
Gauchos!",,,,,,,

This year whenever I’m
on campus studying and there is a family touring I have this overwhelming sense of pride and
that I can’t hold in. I’m always praying that they ask a question so that I have the opportunity to
tell them all about our school and how much I love it here. My love for UCSB is the reason why
I’m running for an off campus senatorial position as I want to become more involved in the
decisions that directly affect our college experience. I want to learn more about the issues that are
affecting our peers and if elected use my voice to amplify their concerns. I also want to advocate
for new programs and ideas that would improve UCSB and Isla Vista for the better such as
promoting environmental sustainability, mental health services and more available outdoor study
areas throughout Isla Vista.","I’m the social chair for the men’s club water polo team. Before the pandemic I was in
charge of organizing socials with other sports clubs and campus organizations. Through this
experience, I’ve interacted with many different people and student groups and have practiced
working with and accomplishing goals with people that have different backgrounds and ideas
than myself. Also as social chair, I was in charge of organizing team fundraisers and
volunteering. As a club I’ve helped organize volunteer opportunities with Isla Vista Surfrider and
Isla Vista’s Parks and Recreation ``adopt and block'' program that is meant to help clean up and
beautify the streets of Isla Vista. Through my time as social chair I have come to learn and love
the Isla Vista community. Last year in the dorms, I was also a floor representative for Santa Cruz
dorm. In this position I attended weekly meetings and voted on how my dorm would spend our
funds on services and activities. From this experience, I met with and got to know many people
in my dorm and advocated for policies and positions that they wanted. I also learned a deeper
understanding of how UCSB administration and RHA works. I’m also a Co-founder of Clean
Consulting, which is a new club at UCSB where we help make groups and organizations become
more sustainable through waste and energy audits. The founding of this club shows how
passionate I am about environmental policies and sustainability. I believe that the climate crisis is
our generation’s existential problem and that is why I want to learn and advocate for
environmentally friendly policies.","One bill I would like to introduce while I’m in office is to secure funding for more
outdoor study spaces in Isla Vista. The pandemic has been hard on students always having to
study at home in shared spaces. One way I hope to address this fatigue is by creating and
securing funding for more outdoor study spaces like those found at HSSB. These tables that have
access to charger ports because of rooftop solar would make it studying outdoors much more
accessible to students living in Isla Vista. Providing outdoor study spaces would help support
students in Isla Vista because they address online school fatigue while also ensuring covid safe
precautions.
Another bill I would like to introduce is to make composting more available throughout
Isla Vista and the University. The Isla Vista Compost Collective is a great program that picks up
Isla Vista resident’s compost. This program is great for addressing food waste and the climate
crisis but currently only serves 96 households. My legislation hopes to help work with the Isla
Vista Community Services District to help make composting an Isla Vista wide practice.
Another important part of my platform that I would like to introduce while in office is a
resolution that ensures that the dining commons have sustainably and ethically produced food.
For example, last year there were often shark cuisines on the menu at the dining commons and I
believe this to be wrong.","The most important part of my platform is to ensure that UCSB and Isla Vista continue to
support environmentally friendly resources and platforms. As an environmental studies and political science major I want to ensure that we as a community continue to work towards a carbon neutral future as a means of combating climate change and environmental injustice. I
hope to work with the university as well as many other student organizations such as the
environmental justice alliance and zero waste committee to help hold the university and
community members accountable in reaching carbon neutrality goals. I will also help support
legislation that supports these goals.
Another part of my platform that is central to my mission is supporting students during
the pandemic, whether that be increased access to study spaces, more mental health services and
other physical/recreational demands. The pandemic has been hard on college students and
already over a year into the pandemic we are still online. This spring quarter the library and recreation center are finally opened up to students, even though they should have been made
accessible to students a while ago. I will be a strong advocate for the university to provide more
resources and help for students to access these needed resources.","As a political science and environmental studies major I’m passionate about
environmental sustainability and environmental justice. To achieve my specific goals I plan to
work with the environmental justice alliance, zero waste committee and the environmental affairs
board. Not only do I plan to collaborate with these specific organizations and entities I also hope
to learn from these and hope to help support them in their efforts and goals for the coming year.
I also want to collaborate with the community affairs board and Isla Vista relations
committee in order to help promote composting and the creation of outdoors study spaces to help
students with the pandemic. I also hope to work with them in achieving and prompting their
goals for 2021.","I will make myself available to my constituents during the rest of the online year by being
approachable on social media. If elected I will have a senate instagram and facebook where I
intend to post accomplished legislation and create updates about what is happening in Associated
Students. Before deciding to run for office, I too had a very little understanding about what
Associated Students does and I want to help the common gaucho understand what Associated
Students does in order for them to have a stronger say. I hope to increase this transparency
through the use of my social media and if any of my constituents have any questions or concerns
they can reach on instagram, facebook and email. I will also have office hours where any can
attend and express their concerns to me. I’m very open to listening and if anyone just wants
someone to talk to I can be that person to them.","I’m the best candidate for this position because of my experiences at UCSB and my love
for this school and community. I love UCSB and everyday I think about how grateful I am to
attend this university and experience the community of Isla Vista. I chose to run because I
wanted to become more involved with the school I love and hope to improve our college
experience by serving the best interests of the community of Isla Vista. As the social chair for the

men’s club water polo team I’ve interacted with many different people and student groups and
I’ve practiced working with and accomplishing goals with people that have different
backgrounds and ideas than myself. This leadership position has prepared me for the senate
because I have worked with people of strong differing interests and have still come to a solution
that serves both parties. This is an important skill needed in the senate because I will be able to
work with all students and help support initiatives that are best for the entire student body.",Left-leaning,"Good - I liked the work they have been doing to implement later
times to change the grading scale to letter grades to pass/no pass and also advocating for students
during the pandemic.","No - I’m personally not educated enough on this topic to have a
designated opinion. Although, I’m open to listening, learning, and discussing more about this
topic in order to better serve my constituents.","Yes - I believe that a public university should be made tuition free as I
believe education should be a human right and that cost of attendance should not be the reason
for someone to not pursue higher education","I believe that UCSB has adequate mental health services but there could always be
improvements. I have used CAPS in the past for counseling services but one of the problems that
I have encountered is that when signing up for appointments they did not have many openings. I
had to wait three weeks before seeing a counselor, which felt like an eternity because of the
current struggle I was encountering. I believe that CAPS should have more funding to hire more
counselors in order to reach the demands of our students during the pandemic. It has been hard
on us all and we should do the most we can to to help ensure the safety and well being of our
students.
Another way to promote UCSB mental health services is providing social distanced and
covid safe social interactions outdoors to help freshmen and transfer students meet people. I can’t
imagine what the current freshman are going through, it was hard enough moving to college
without a pandemic and we should advocate for safe interactions to help build these needed
friendships.","I believe that Greek life should have handled the response to partying better. Greek life
was slow to respond to the calls for safety and no partying in Isla Vista, which in turn led to the
spread of covid throughout the community. There should have been more accountability

throughout the organization. The university is doing the best they can to maintain partying and
covid in Isla Vista. They have had limited resources and little legal power over the private
properties in Isla Vista. I think organizations and individuals should be punished depending on
the severity of the party and their campus affiliation. If there is a larger party that is hosted by a
campus affiliated organization there should be a larger punishment than those that are smaller
and not affiliated.","The university’s title nine office is a good start in dealing with sexual assault to but the university
needs to be doing more to support sexual assault survivors. One way the university can do more
is by providing more mental health services because even though CAPS is a great resource there
are long wait times and survivors need counseling that help them through their process the entire
time. Another way for the university to better serve sexual assault survivors is to collaborate
with campus orgnanizations to promote more accountability across campus. This way it helps
raise awareness of sexual assault and also supports for survivors.","As a member of the LGBTQ+ community I believe that UCSB has many resources that
effectively serve the community. Although, I am a white cis-male and I do feel safe in Isla Vista
and at UCSB in general. This being said I do not speak for the entire community nor do I share
the same experiences. If my constituents and friends feel differently and believe that UCSB does
not do enough to serve the LGBTQ+ community I will be an advocate for more support and
change in these areas.
Also, as a white cis-male I believe that I cannot speak on the issues of other historically
underrepresented groups such as the Black, Latinx, and Indigeneous peoples as I have not lived
their experience or shared their struggles. I will be an ally and advocate for these
underrepresented groups and hope to serve my peers in the most effective way possible. I hope to
listen and work together to help those that believe that UCSB should do more in helping these
communities.","My first bill that I plan to author is one that secures funding for more outdoor study
spaces in Isla Vista. The pandemic has been hard on students always having to study at home in
shared spaces. I’m tired of sharing a living room with four roommates while attending online
school. It is hard to concentrate and I need to get into the mindset of “school.” One way I hope to
address this fatigue is by creating and securing funding for more outdoor study spaces like those
found at HSSB. These tables that have access to charger ports because of rooftop solar would
make it studying outdoors much more accessible to students living in Isla Vista. I hope to
collaborate with the university and the Isla Vista Community Services Department to help
support and build these study spaces. Providing outdoor study spaces would help support
students in Isla Vista because they address online school fatigue while also ensuring covid safe
precautions.","One thing that could make A.S. seem more accessible to students is making sure during
orientation and gaucho fyi there is a little brief section about what A.S. does and how to become
more involved. I know that I did not know what A.S. did until I started to campaign for this
election. One way to make A.S. more transparent is to promote social media and create more of a
following so students know and can voice their concerns directly. A.S. needs to be more
transparent so that more students can have a say about their education. I will also help support
new ideas and legislation that creates more student involvement for A.S.","As a senator I would help in the transition back to in-person instruction and in-person
activities in Isla Vista by being a strong advocate for these programs and students. If elected I
hope to make my voice and many others heard about the importance of offering in-person
instruction. We all miss campus dearly and desperately trying to go back. I will help support the
university if they need to make adjustments to learning in order to make it covid safe. I will
author resolutions calling for UCSB to open up more in person resources and advocate for in
person instruction, even if it is a hybrid instruction. As a second year student, the majority of my

college experience has been online and I hope that fall 2021 will be in person, and if elected I
will do all that I can to advocate for this change.","The university failed in supporting their students and did not provide students with the
resources they should have. It is now spring quarter and UCSB has finally opened up the library
and recreation center for reservations. Other schools such as Cal Poly and UC Davis have had
their recreation center and library open for reservations since fall quarter (they also allowed
freshmen on campus since fall quarter). This is drastically different from UCSB which from a
student’s perspective did not care about their students physical health and well being. UCSB
should be trying to implement covid safe resources instead of having a zero tolerance policy.
Although, I believe that university has made improvements with their testing and covid
quarantine housing. This has helped contain the virus in Isla Vista and has helped students who
live in tight quarters to move out into free housing if needed. They also have done well and
professor’s have done their best for being accommodating during covid and making the switch
from in person to online classes. I believe that there is always room for improvement and that the
university should make plans for in person instruction in the fall and for increased capacity of the
library and other in person resources.",,,,,,,

I feel that for
the past two years I have been working at getting to this point where I can call myself a Gaucho,
and now that I am here, I feel that simply being a UCSB student is not enough for me to embody
the name. I am running as a senator for the 73rd senate because I want to help. I want to help
make life more enjoyable for the students in the community. I want to allow for students without
a voice in the senate to be heard. I want to allow for students struggling with mental health to
have quick and easy access to resources. I want to coordinate and debate with other senators so
that we can learn and build off each other. I want for life to be as best suited for students living
off-campus as it is for those on-campus. I want students to feel safe and not stress over school
matters outside of the classroom. I want to prepare for an efficient return to college life
post-pandemic. I want to do many things and running as senator is going to allow me the chance
to do those things. I want to help.","I have not been considerably involved with groups and/or activities on campus or in Isla Vista
because the pandemic has made it very difficult for many to do so. UCSB has not made many
efforts to have new students become involved in any organizations. I have decided to run for
A.S. Senate as my own way of becoming involved in organizations pertaining to UCSB and my
preparation for the role should be evident in the boldness of my action.",,,,,"What makes me the best candidate for my position is that so far my entire academic career here
at UCSB has been off-campus. I recently transferred and since the Fall quarter in 2020 I have
been living out my life as a college student in Isla Vista, Goleta, Santa Barbara, etc. So far as I
am concerned “off-campus” has been my campus and I have familiarized myself with the

orientations of student life here. I have been studying and listening to the complaints and wishes
of the community and decided that I am in a good position to make those voices heard and
applied. I think an apt way to put it would be that the best candidate is also somewhat of an
average candidate, meaning that my experiences compared to my peers are quite similar and I
work with an analogous mindset which may align with their interests. I have been in positions of
leadership before but I try my best not to let that get into my head remind myself that I am a
servant to the people I represent and not some figurehead that hangs over others. I am the best
candidate for this position because I exemplify what a senator must be; I am a representative that
listens.",Centrist,"Very Good - I have not studied the previous A.S. Senate very closely as
I have just transferred this previous year. From what I could gather, the previous Senate had to
deal with a whole slew of responsibilities and obstacles that came with the pandemic. Obviously
the student body had never encountered anything of that nature, so I must commend any actions
that were taken by the Senate as brave decisions that were not allowed the luxury of referring to
history as a basis. A Senate’s job is never perfect and now since hindsight is 20/20 we can use
those actions taken by A.S. and improve upon them.","No - As a Global Studies major my formal answer is too long to
fit in the given space, but here are two main points. The first reason being the countries aligning
themselves with Palestine have already attempted to boycott Israel’s economy on many
occasions since 1948 and it has still not achieved the goal of alleviating human rights violations
in Israel. The second reason being the movement has done very little to help Palestinians because
if it worked it would render thousands of Palestinian workers in Israel unemployed and few
would give up jobs for a long term cause.","Yes - I have yet to meet a student that would want to pay for their tuition. I
find it generally difficult to believe that being able to afford a college education in the United
States has permissibally gotten much more difficult compared to previous generations that could
pay off their fees with minimum wage jobs. The increasing costs also contributes to
marginalizing economic classes. Education is no longer a privilege and should be seen as a right
to anyone pursuing an academic career in higher education.","I’m not super informed about this question due to being a transfer but I will continue to educate
myself on this matter. However, from what I have seen the student body has sustained a heavy
blow on mental health as a result of the pandemic. In this case I have not seen an adequate
mental health service provided by UCSB to students online. What I believe should be done to
address this problem is having options that would alleviate students off some level of stress or
rather engage them a little more in school related affairs that are not within a class. For some
students that deterioration in mental health may come from stress in classes, yes, but for others it
may come from a lack of stimulation and/or a change in scenery. For those suffering from stress
and anxiety, there should be counselling services that are willing to listen to students and
workout solutions in alleviating some class stress perhaps by communicating with educators to
restructure a specific assignment that would help said student. For those lacking the stimulation
it would be more difficult to alleviate but some options would include school sponsored fitness
programs that engage students and promote a healthy lifestyle working out at home and having
an instructor help them maintain their exercise.",,"There’s always more that can be done at the university to prevent sexual assault and support
survivors. The only allowable amount of Title IX related incidents is 0%. The university could
set up safe spaces and counseling groups for survivors of sexual assault. As a survivor myself the
most difficult thing I have encountered when dealing with the experience was finding the
courage to tell someone because of a few factors. First it is difficult to find someone to trust
enough to share the experience; even if it is one person's most trusted family members, friends,
companions, it's difficult to share in fear that they might misunderstand the experience. A group
of people that have found themselves in similar situations could help others open up about their
trauma because they have a better understanding of what it is like, and it's a good step in a
constructive process of overcoming one’s experience. What the university can do is create that
safe space, that help group, led by trained specialists, and help create a lifeline to those in need of
support.","Simply put, if we’re still referring to these groups as “underrepresented then the university has
not been effectively serving enough to historically underrepresented groups. As I’m not fully
familiar with what occurred on campus prior to the pandemic since I am a transfer student, but
there can never be too much. There is a whole slew of underrepresented groups both in and out
of UCSB but I have not come to see any of these groups being represented while online
instruction was taking place. It feels as if the service to these groups is only reaching those that
either are directly involved in those communities or are actively searching for them. For others
that are unaware of the situation they seem to remain that way unless they stumble across any
representation by accident. UCSB could do more with actively spreading the message and
awareness for these groups by voicing them through a “louder” medium at the university rather
than send snippets of information in our emails. UCSB has a 31.3% white population while

almost all the rest of the demographics make up less than 20%. From these statistics I think
UCSB should do more than what is normally done to service representation for minority groups.","If I were elected to serve on the A.S Senate my first resolution or bill that I plan to author would
be to utilize the ~2 million dollars in the A.S. rollover account that has accumulated over the
years and give it back to the student body as a form of reparation to students that have sustained
some sort of significant loss since the Covid-19 pandemic. 2 million is a lot and with that money
I feel it is only fair that it goes back to the students because thus far the money has not been
going anywhere. The plan is to prioritize freshman and transfer students that had just started their
education at UCSB during the Fall quarter of 2020 and still had to pay full price. The initial step
would be to gain access to the account that is holding all the money and then from there the
challenge would be to see who holds priority for the need of the money. From there we will
decide whether the money is better given out as a transaction or utilized in a service that would
be beneficial to all parties involved to ensure that it is being used wisely.","The media is always seen as an efficient work-around the problem of inaccessibility but I believe
that has already been attempted multiple times before. The senate must make itself even more
available to the student body with things such as events that allow for students to interact with
A.S. directly. Q&A sessions, food related events hosted by A.S. that features key speakers from
the board, or even allow for individual members to host their own Zoom calls for the student
body. For the Q&A, either online or in person, it will feature any and all members that want to
take part and have the floor open to students that want to ask questions or perpetuate discussion
with commentary. Students will be notified weeks in advance through media channels at A.S.’s
dispossal and that should be enough to reach out to any student that wishes to interact with A.S.
Individually hosted Zoom calls will be similarly made where members could announce their
personal calls under A.S. oversight and by using the same media channels members take turns
announcing their Zoom sessions. To keep the student body updated on general information it
would be beneficial to make meeting minutes public and also set up a livestream channel that
airs A.S. meetings.","The transition back to in-person classes will be a confusing one and for many students it won’t
be returning BACK to classes but rather their first time going to said classes. As a senator I will
help aid the transition by becoming a voice for those that do not have enough representation
when voicing their concerns with the transition. I would also like to create a re-introduction
program that will help students transition back into an environment full of people in person
rather than in front of a screen. It is important to note that this sort of transition will definitely
cause anxiety and stress in some students and we cannot simply throw them back into the fray if
we want them to succeed. A program/study group would be beneficial to those that need help
getting back into the swing of things as they had once were. Many of us have gotten used to the
seclusion but that will not have to be the norm anymore. Understandably so, a guide of sorts will
be necessary for an easier transition for the students that have sacrificed some of their social
prowess for the sake of everyone’s safety during the pandemic.","The university did not handle transition into the new school year very adequately. The Fall
quarter had many professors still struggling over the concept of online classes. I believe that
UCSB could have better utilized the decrease in student attendance over the Summer quarter to
better prepare educators over formatting and structuring classes around Zoom and other online
resources for before the Fall. International students could have been better accommodated for
synchronous classes that would take place during unusually late/early times in their respective
locations, at least to allow for uniform asynchronous options to those that needed it. For
incoming freshmen and transfers, the housing situation was a tense operation because many that
were waiting to hear back from the university in regards to housing had received news that there
would be no housing available only a few weeks before classes were to start. It is already
difficult enough trying to find housing in Isla Vista in the spring, let alone a couple weeks before
the fall. Finally the biggest failure by the school when handling the pandemic was tuition. It is
borderline theft to charge students full tuition prices and only receive a portion of the services
available at UCSB. There should of at the very least been a reduced price or a discount on online
learning resources instead of paying full price along with paying for extra tools for online
instruction.",,,,,,,

money on the priorities that will make a difference in your life. The top priority right now is
COVID 19. The end of the pandemic is getting closer by the minute. A return to normal life is
almost here. Yet, more change will occur before everything will settle down. School will not
advance completely into in-person school, instead it approaches a hybrid system that will take
plenty of effort to make successful. Clubs, sports, and concerts cannot open up as they once
were. But unique and COVID safe measures can be taken to bring these back and make them
even better than before.
Many changes are coming our way and we must ride the wave before it swallows us up. I will be
in the 73rd senate because I have big ideas and big ways to get them done. Furthermore, none of
this could be possible if it were not for one person, you. You, the UCSB student, have concerns
that range from food accessibility, house affordability, and school accountability. You, the UCSB
student, deserve to have your voice heard. Has your voice been heard enough since being at
UCSB? No? Then join me into the 2021-22 school year and join the movement to make an
amazing UCSB even better.","As a UCSB student in Biopsych, I understand the grind you go through each and every day:
Aleks, labs, book problems. CLAS is an amazing resource that allows cooperation and a space to
interlock ideas with other people, which is critical while classes are online.
Staring at a screen, going outside for food, coming back indoors to stare at the screen some more.
No one thought school would look like this over a year after COVID 19 shut down schools and
public spaces across the nation. If anything has taken a toll since the dramatic change, it would
be our mental health. CAPS has done an amazing job with its availability and continues to make
positive impacts on people every day. However, I understand the fatigue plaguing many people

today, not to mention the anxiety built around returning back to in-person classes soon. Most of
us have forgotten what in-person school looks like and the thought of changing our habits again
is unnerving. This has all added to the mental health decline. While most people feel powerless
about their mental health, I know there is good news coming our way and I will make it one of
my top priorities when I enter office to help everyone transition once again. I do not like my
laptop enough to accept failure and not go back into in person classes.","We are now over one year into the COVID 19 pandemic and the end is finally near. What will
this end look like? You may feel murky or powerless thinking about this question, yet it will
determine your experience and enjoyment of another year. We must hop on this wave and ride it
out. A massive resolution must be opened to assess COVID 19 better. Open more testing
services. Get Isla Vista ready for these COVID vaccines and possibly for future vaccines if the
coronavirus evolves enough. I will help UCSB prepare for life post-vaccine and make your time
at UCSB even better than it would've been two years ago.
Article 2 of the 2020-2021 Elections Code states that “B) All students shall have the right to
affordable housing”. I will introduce a bill that assures improved living conditions in IV to make
sure every student has a stable, affordable, and ideal place to live. It is your guaranteed right.
How can someone get good grades when they have termites at their feet, mold in the shower and
a cold broken window?
I do not like staying indoors for gloomy weather. I like spending sunny days outside. I will
introduce a bill to bring back outdoor intramural sports and part these clouds. More outside
activities will improve mental health and provide students with something to be invested in.
College is not a time to worry and stress. It is only four years long and many of you have already
passed by a majority of this time. It is time to bring back fun and enjoy the short time we have
here at UCSB.","The majority of UCSB students I have communicated with do not know what is going on in
UCSB A.S. but wish that could change. It is finally time to put students first. I will reflect this by
being completely transparent and using many social media outlets to reach out to each corner of
the student body. If it is any one thing that the pandemic has positively impacted, it would be a
broader connection through social media. Social activism on social media is thriving at an
incredible pace. I will use my social media to advocate for you, the student, and communicate
the change I am working on. You deserve honesty and transparency, nothing less. I will also open
up office hours in easier ways to have your needs met. Catch me on social media and talk to me
about the next big change you want to see. Do not be afraid to voice your concerns. I am a
human advocate. I will advocate for you and your cause, whatever it may be.
Do you believe your rent is too high in Isla Vista? Then let's fix it because one cannot expect to
achieve ideal grades when they are worrying about gathering money before the 1st of the month.
Do you believe your ethnicity is under represented in A.S.? My beautiful mother is from Jalisco,
Mexico and I have seen under representation and I do not like it. I will advocate for your group’s
concerns and make sure every person of every origin is represented fairly.
Are you a strong believer in dirt roads and off-roading on campus? Well I will be honest and tell
you it is an interesting view that I will consider, yet acting on it will be difficult.","I love celebrating ethnic diversity and culture. I sleep under la Virgen de Guadalupe, the Virgin
Mary, every night. I grew up praying the Rosario, the Rosary, with my family on most nights. I
see myself as an adequate zapateo dancer. I celebrate my culture and I support every person that
does the same. There is power in our differences. I will work with Mexican organizations and
other communities to: assure the ethnic groups are being represented, encourage the power
behind social activism, and open up access for people to join a community where they will feel at
home.
I hate cancer. Even through this awful pandemic, cancer stays prevalent and continues to harm
families. I have been a camper since I was 11 years old and lately a Counselor-in-Training for
Camp Kesem at UC Davis. Camp Kesem is a week-long safe haven for kids and young adults
impacted by a parent’s cancer. Cancer can flip any kid’s world on its head. Even though there are

plenty of resources across the world concentrated on curing this disease and helping those
impacted by it. We can do our part here at UCSB. I hope to work with Camp Kesem at UCSB
and begin fundraisers again to continue the fight against cancer.

_________________________________________________________________________","Everyone has opinions on how things can change and most could think of one way for their
limited time at UCSB to be improved in a split second. UCSB is amazing but it can be made
better. Visit office hours when a thought or idea pops up on how you can make UCSB better.
Most likely others feel the same way and by voicing your concern you would serve these other
people too. The majority of students I have communicated with have not taken advantage of
current Office Hours. This is not acceptable and I will not allow people’s voices to go unheard. I
will make it easier for you, your friends, and your peers to speak with me so I can pause and
push. I will pause and listen to your concerns then push to get it done. UCSB 2021-22 will have
hybrid class and my office hours will reflect this. Join my social media live office hours on top of
the regular zoom office hours. Together we can make your time at UCSB better.","As your Off-Campus Senator I will pause and push your concerns. I can bring you the most
change and help you make your time at UCSB the best it can be. How will I do this? I will do
this by pausing and pushing. My social media live office hours will be a great resource for you
and for the student body to communicate their concerns. I am the most transparent. You deserve
nothing less than an honest candidate that can report on exactly what it is that they are working
on. I will clearly communicate my efforts and the bills I am supporting. You deserve nothing
less.
You deserve better. You deserve change. Is your life any better than it was last year?
Join by my side and together we can make your time at this amazing school even better.","Left-leaning, Centrist","Excellent - The 72nd A.S. Senate was incredible at addressing the
needs of the student body so far. But much has changed and much more will change before
normalcy is back. The next Senate must push UCSB on a post-pandemic path that encourages
hybrid school, more in person activities, and a continuance of safety for its students and
community.","UCSB has investments across the world.
Some are in the nation of Israel. They have caused controversy on the support investments for a
country. I believe the A.S. UCSB should not divest because the companies are not central to the
country’s welfare and having investments is not directly causing controversy.","No - I do not support sacrificing world class professors and taking
money out of scholarships. Tuition should be reduced during Online class because less money is
being used for infrastructure and maintenance. As UCSB students, we deserve the best
professors, classes, and school experience. Reduce but do not abandon tuition.","No. First of all, the lack of in person activity due to the COVID 19 pandemic has caused mental
health to decline and made it harder to improve mental health. It has created a downward spiral
that UCSB attempted to recognize by setting up CAPS online quickly. This did help lift mental
health. Yet, more action is needed. UCSB needs to pause and push. Declining mental health is a
real issue and this must be acted upon. UCSB did try to address the problem but you deserve
better.
My proposal is to push for UCSB to open up new and innovative plans to help students and their
mental health. Why isn’t there a weekly class, accessible on GOLD, that focuses on improving
mental health through meditation, founded by an educational yet applicable curriculum, and
taught by a motivated teacher? Routinely being aware of your mental health will dramatically
improve your wellbeing and a weekly class would offer this needed consistency. Everyone uses
GOLD. This is the type of innovation you deserve and I will push UCSB’s boards to introduce
ideas like this.
CAPS is a great online resource and was an amazing in person resource. Their faculty is world
class and very impactful. However, a new method to reach to students is needed because
appointments have their limited impact. UCSB must go on the offense and instead of making
students reach out to schedule appointments, efforts should be directed to making it easier for
students to receive help with their mental health. You deserve better.","I call on the student body of UCSB to remember the severity of the COVID 19 pandemic but to
also empathize and put yourself in someone else’s shoes. I understand many students continue to
be frustrated with those that share different views. Social media has shown the tension
surrounding and plaguing students. But the posts that are rare to find are those that are often
more common in reality. The majority of students hold a strong opinion and reasons for their
beliefs, yet they also understand that they are unique and people have led different lives and
encountered different morals.

The posts of two groups cooperating and attempting to fix problems are rare, yet they are the
posts that reflect the majority of the student body.
It is important to remember that those hanging out with friends still want to stop the spread of
COVID 19 and those avoiding gatherings with people do miss a social college campus. Try and
understand the people that you disagree with, this is the only way to come out of this as a
stronger community. In the end, we are all UCSB students. We are all reaching for higher
education and will be forever connected because of it. We will Rise Above these divisions and
UCSB will be greater for it.","Sexual assault happens in colleges, in urban areas, and ultimately across the world. It is a
crime that has impacts everyone regardless of culture, ethnicity, or religion. Everyone can agree
sexual assault needs to be eradicated and one way to eradicate it is through society’s awareness
of the situation, which has seen great promise so far.
Society’s denial on sexual assault has grown exponsentially in the last 50 years, ever since the
federal civil rights law Title IX was passed. This has been the result of sexual assault awareness
among college boards, college students, and Greek life. UCSB for example, required all
incoming freshman in 2020 to take multiple courses on sexual harrassment, discrimination, and
assualt prevention.
However, we still have a long road ahead. The university’s Title IX office has done an excellent
job so far, but it must put more resources in helping the survivors of sexual assault. I can
promote live events online and eventually in person dedicated to helping these survivors heal.
The university must introduce more resources and extend more mental health facilities to help
these survivors heal.","UCSB must communicate with minority groups to assess the changes that need to be made,
especially during the pandemic. The pandemic has hurt minorities the most. UCSB must
consider their needs a priority.
My mother came into the U.S.A. 25 years ago from Mexico and made a distinguished career in
nursing with the help of her school. I could not imagine her raising her three children alone,
going to school everyday, and working night shifts now in the middle of the awful COVID 19
pandemic. People with special circumstances must be addressed and helped more, just like my
amazing Mom was, to assure minority groups are successful. Equality is not enough. Equity is
what you deserve. Equity is the way of the future and UCSB must act now to effectively serve
historically underrepresented communities.
This can start by expanding ethnic clubs and communities. When more on campus housing opens
up, ethnic living communities must be improved. The LGBTQ+ community at UCSB is large
and exceptional and deserves more events and funding. UCSB is a great school for these
communities but it can be made better.","I plan to author a bill that opens up studying spaces across Isla Vista. Stable study spaces across
campuses, whether indoors like libraries or outside like beaches and gazebos, have shown to
provide a stable space people can rely on and grades significantly improve. The library is great
but the people of IV need more stable places to study, preferably outside.
I want to expand study spaces for everyone to use and specifically build what I call Gaucho
Gazebos for students to comfortably study. These Gaucho Gazebos would have amazing shade,
an outlet to charge devices, and easy accessibility so any student can stop by and study for their
massive chemistry final coming up. Don't you want better grades and wouldn't you want to study
under a Gaucho Gazebo?","Each Senator is responsible for being transparent on their behalf. I will be transparent as your
Off-Campus Senator by posting to my social media the efforts I am pursuing and which of your
concerns I am currently working on. It is clear that a senator cannot do everything at once, but
that is no reason to be silent and secretive. You deserve honesty and nothing less. My social
media office hours won’t just be for you to voice your concerns, but also for you to ask and learn
what resolution I am working on. It is a two way road transparent to all.
Although people have run into problems getting their voice heard while Senators are only seen
online, the average student is who I will represent as a Off-Campus Senator. Join me to introduce
office hours based on social media platforms, it can be a resource for all future Senators to use as
well.","Everyone misses normal college life. Some of us have only ever heard of what normal college
life looks like. This is not permanent. I will make safely opening up in person activities my
priority because it is your priority.
You deserve the best education and I will start by pursuing a resolution to get classes ready for a
hybrid system that ventilates rooms, spreads students apart, and keeps class sizes small. Small
class sizes have shown to improve student to teacher communication and cooperation, thus
keeping hybrid classes smaller will also benefit your education. The resolution sounds expensive
but I know you do not deserve a raise in fees. In fact, according to 2020-21 Elections Code
Article 2, “A) All students shall have the right to an affordable education”. I will redirect other
funds into opening the school's campus again and protect your given right.
Furthermore, testing services, places to receive the vaccine, and outdoor activities will need to be
expanded soon. Everyone is desperate for an end to this pandemic. I assure you, the end is near
and a better UCSB will come out of it as a result.","UCSB attempted to minimize the impact of the pandemic on its students, but there was no
avoiding the situation that we live under now. It did not adopt as well as it should have. This
includes creating a hybrid system as many other colleges in highly populated areas of California
have done. In person classes could have safely continued under close supervision and with

regulations. Outdoor activities were also disbanded unreasonably. Open them up again. Test the
students. Only allow outdoor and small sports to continue but at least open them up again.
Nevertheless, UCSB did a great job at preventing COVID cases on campus and in the
surrounding community. The community is very glad for UCSB’s efforts in fighting the
coronavirus. The testing services provided by the school are great. UCSB has done a great job so
far but change is coming and UCSB must adapt.",,,,,,,

In my short time at UCSB, I have fallen in love with the people and the community. There are so much diversity and so much passion within the community. That passion has fueled me to want to make a change in my community. However, I hope to accomplish so much more than that. I want to be a representation in our community, a voice, a person someone could come and talk to, and just a person who cares. I believe that the senate is where I could be all I want while having the platform to do so. ","Being a part of Greek Life has given me many leadership opportunities as well as the ability to hear experiences from a diverse group of people. This has been a big inspiration for me to run for the senate. Additionally, throughout the last three years of my life, I was a part of a model legislator and court program called Youth and Government. In this program, I learned the inner workings of how a senate worked, tons of amazing people from all walks of life, and experiences that will last a lifetime. I think that a combination of my passion and experiences has prepared me to be an off-campus senator. Additionally, I have lived in Isla Vista this past year and understand what the needs of off-campus students are.","While in office, the three bills that I would love to introduce would be an increase in off-campus study spaces, improvement of lighting in Isla Vista, and an increase in local environmental efforts. During the pandemic, my peers and I found it difficult to find study spaces. Adding more off-campus study spaces will give students more accessibility and convenience when they want to study, even past the pandemic. Additionally, I would increase lighting in Isla Vista to make our streets safer for students. No one likes walking down a dark street at night. Lastly, I would strive
to pass a bill that would inspire environmental consciousness amongst the residents of Isla Vista. Included in this bill would be an improvement of recycling, garbage, and composting systems along with Isla Vista. Additionally, I would find local organizations to help enact this bill. ","My platform is to leave UCSB better than I found it. We are blessed that we have an Associated Students sector that has such a big impact on UCSB. They have worked so hard and left such a big and long-lasting legacy on our community. I want to continue that, and strive to make our legacy even better. To do so, I would like to introduce bills and resolutions such as increasing study spaces off-campus, improve local environmental efforts and expand blue light systems. These are just a few things I want to do in the office. I realize as a senator, I must be in contact with as many off-campus students as possible. Doing so will help me understand the problems and issues they have, and will help me understand what I need to do for my constituents. Additionally, talking to so many people will help me understand what I can do to benefit the most. ","I plan to work with many organizations and entities to help with my platforms. I plan to work with the UCSD in order to help expand their self-defense programs and help raise awareness for it. Furthermore, I want to work with organizations such as the Refuse, Recycling, Research Center, Environmental Affairs Board, and churches. These organizations have and will continue to inspire environmental consciousness by offering composting and recycling systems which is a big part of my platform. In addition, I plan to work with organizations that help the fight against sexual assault such as CAPS. All in all, any organization or entity that could help my platform or my constituents, I am more than willing to work with. ","If remote instruction continues in the 2021-2022 school, I have many plans to make myself available to my constituents. First off, I would host meetings every week for at least an hour. During this meeting, any constituent would be able to join and voice any concern they have. In addition to this, my email will always be open, and will reply in less than 24 hours. Furthermore, I would run an Instagram page. This not only gives constituents another platform to contact me on, but it also gives them more transparency. On this page, I would highlight what I support or any bills I am working on and presenting. I would update them on any important meetings and
the progress that these bills made. Through Instagram and email, I would make myself open to having one-on-one meetings with my constituents to address more serious and personal issues, while giving them a more comfortable setting. ","Throughout my life and even today, I have had no idea what I wanted to be. All that I know is to continue to do the things I love to do and everything else would fall in place. I realized that I would strive for leadership positions, especially any leadership positions that included helping others. And that when I would earn these positions, I would not sit there and do nothing. I would do everything I could and beyond, in my power. I love Isla Vista, I love UCSB, and I love the people of Isla Vista. They have made me feel like I belong; legitimately gave me a new home away from home. I want to give so much back and more to Isla Vista because of this. Through my passion, experience, and determination, I believe that I will go above and beyond as your off-campus senator. I want to continue to build on UCSB and Isla Vista and leave a legacy that I will be proud to come back to in 10 years. ",Centrist,"Very Good - I thought the work of the 72nd senate was very sufficient. Throughout their time and their insane circumstances, they accomplished a ton. However, there can always be more done to meet the needs of students","No - I would vote against a resolution to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. It is supposed to help the Palestinians and their movement. However, it hurts them as tons of Palestinians work in Israeli companies. Additionally, I do not think it’s a college senate’s place to deal with international politics. ","No - In a perfect world, I would love education to be free for everyone. However, with the world we live in, we would not be able to receive all the resources we have without students paying. I do believe we should work on lowering fees and pushing for students with lower income to have lower fees. Tuition is a necessary part, however, we should try to alleviate the cost and help people any way we can.","I think UCSB mental health services at UCSB are fairly adequate. There are a ton of resources that the university offers, which is amazing. Some of these services include CAPS, The Mental Health Town Hall, and UCSB CARES. I think we could improve these services. I think the problem is that students do not know that these resources exist. I think we need to spread greater awareness of these resources so students know that they exist. Additionally, I would like to push for more funding for these organizations and programs. I want these programs and organizations to be able to do the best job they possibly can, and funding always helps. All in all, I think the services are adequate, however, that does not mean we can not improve them. ","I thought that the university could have handled the situation much better. I thought there should have been more accountability across the board. It felt as if the University was taking a blind eye to party across Isla Vista. I think there needs to be more communication between organizations and the university, as well as more accountability. Additionally, the University has to be more transparent with its actions and punishments. ","I am familiar with Title IX and its functions and I believe that it’s an imperfect system that could be made better to address sexual assault amongst the UC campuses. However, I do think there are issues such as mishandling students’ sexual assault cases, what falls under Title IX, and the effectivity of the title. Additionally, I do believe this system could be improved by expanding existing programs and create more resources to aid in the fight against sexual assault. I think the UC system is off to a great start but has to do better. ","I think the university should turn its head towards these communities and should listen and enact on their needs. There are many student-led organizations based on historically underrepresented groups that the university should aid with either funding or helping with expansions. I think UCSB should better enable them to promote and create awareness on campus. All in all, I think UCSB is moving in the right direction. ","The first bill that I would plan to author if I am elected to serve on the A.S. Senate is to increase the number of study spaces available to off-campus students. During the pandemic, it has been tough for students to find places to study and focus. Additionally, it is even more convenient and useful for students to have study spaces closer to them, instead of or having to go all the way to the library or their homes. Doing this will help tons of off-campus students. ","To make AS more accessible and make the student body more involved, I would do a number of things. First off, I would introduce my own senate page on Instagram. On this page, I first plan to post what bills I am supporting and what bills I am working on. In addition to this, I plan on showing the progress of bills and what bills lead to. Furthermore, I would instate a weekly zoom where anyone in the student body could come and join. This would be an open forum so any questions or concerns are welcome. I would also offer my email to those who do not have the time to attend zooms. I believe that having these platforms will make AS more accessible to the student body and give more transparency ","I would be a resource for students and would listen to their concerns while this transition is happening. This has been an extremely tough year for the students of UCSB. It will definitely be a difficult transition as a ton of students had to stay home this year, specifically the first years. I would make myself available to my constituents and help them in any way possible. Doing so will allow me to better see the problems and issues that arise in students in their transition to in-person activities. This will allow me to be better informed. I would then use my senate position to tackle the problems.","I want to start off by saying no one expected the pandemic. It came out of nowhere and we were being forced to get creative and figure things out. I think under these circumstances, the university did a great job. There will always be issues and it is good to point these out. Some of them include not accounting for student conditions in the pandemic and not being on campus, still having to pay for campus resources that cannot be used, and some classes giving unbelievable amounts of work. I think the university succeeded in turning everything to zoom and remote instruction and allowing students to P/NP in most departments up until the last day of instruction. However, we are on the last leg of the pandemic and will be hopefully going back to normal times soon. What happened is in the past, and will better prepare us for the future.",,,,,,,
Megan Khobian,atmika,Off Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162852/megan-khobian.jpg,,She/her/hers,2nd,Art History,,,"I am running to be an Off-Campus Senator because of my determination to empower the student body, by giving them a voice in the most powerful student-led organization on campus, the Associated Students. I strive to embody the collective voice by listening to your concerns,
collaborating with other leaders, and advocating for a change. I want to take part in progressing our community, making Isla Vista a safer and more inclusive environment for all. I will give you a voice by constantly being open to conversation and collaboration with any, and all, who are looking for the support. I would like to make a change in the everyday lives of our peers and believe I have the skillset to do so. I deeply care about our UCSB community, we shape each other into the people we are today and our future selves. As senator, I simply want to be a part of the improvement of our beloved school. I recognize that there are inequalities in our community resources, I strive to make a community where each student is granted equal and accessible opportunities. Student university collaboration is the most effective way to make change, as senator I plan to use the power of collaboration to its fullest extent to advocate for every student of our diverse community.","Joining any student organizations is one of the most rewarding activities students can partake in here, at UCSB. Each organization provides a unique benefit, whether it be for creating new friendships, finding academic or emotional support, or even practicing healthy lifestyle habits through intramural sports. Holding a leadership position in my sorority has taught me a lot about the complexity of large student organizations. As a leading member of the organization, I have grown an awareness of how to work with people of all differing personalities and opinions to achieve a common goal. As the Director of Alumni Relations, I acted as the liaison between
alumnae and active members, improving my communication and organization skills. Furthermore, partaking in the UCSB Family Literacy Program as a tutor for the underprivileged children of Santa Barbara County, has improved my problem solving skills and creativity in terms of maneuvering online education. Working with underprivileged children I have first hand seen the effects of inequitable environments; this experience only motivates me to address the inequalities in our own campus community. I could not be more grateful to have the opportunity to run for the position of Senator, which will only intensify my leadership skills.","I plan to introduce bills that expand the Recreation Center’s instructional programs, construct outdoor study spaces, broaden the A.S. Food Bank, and advance academic advising opportunities. I would like to ensure that the Recreation Center offers self defense classes every
quarter, and that these classes open to all UCSB students, regardless of any discriminatory barrier. Moreover, I aim to make these classes gratuitous to ensure inclusivity. This program is specifically important to me as I believe it would be greatly beneficial to our community for people to harbor an individual sense of security. Additionally, I will introduce a bill that will place solar-powered study tables around Isla Vista to give students a covid-safe outdoor space to
study. The solar panels enable the tables to be environmental and technology conscious as the panels would power the wireless computer and phone chargers. The tables I have described are already scattered around the HSSB and I believe it would be a great asset for Isla Vista. Additionally, I want to expand the A.S. Food Bank. Food insecurity is an unfortunate and scary reality, I would like to use my position to help those in need. I would propose weekend pop-up
locations in Isla Vista to ensure that the peers of our community will feel secure at all times.
Lastly, I would create a Peer Academic Advising Program. I believe the student body would
highly benefit from academic advising from peers of their same major/minors. The past two
years I have spent at UCSB I have heard countless remarks about the inaccessibility and anxiety
caused by meetings with Academic Advising Counselors. Talking to individuals of similar age
and rank can make meetings more comfortable for anxious students. I personally find it
extremely comforting getting advice from peers who are on the same academic paths as me and
have personally taken the classes, or have had the same professors, that I am inquiring about.","Every member of our community deserves to have their voice heard. My platform is based on empowering your voice. I aim to advocate for the collective student body and achieve our collective goals. I have fallen in love with our UCSB community these past two years, but we all can acknowledge that it has its faults. Through achieving the goals of my platform, stated in detail in question #3, I aim to improve safety, heighten community morale, and battle food insecurity. As a senator I will serve you, not my personal interests. I would like to make changes that would benefit each UCSB student and improve their daily lives. If I am elected Off-Campus
Senator, with the 73rd senate, I will work with my fellow senators and other A.S. personnel to achieve my goals. I find great strength in the power of collaboration and will ask my fellow

senators to advocate for you, with me. To achieve my goal of representing the collective voice I
will make myself available through email, social media, and Zoom meetings to anyone who
would like to bring an issue to my attention. Through hard work and determination I will
advocate for those who have been historically silenced and disregarded.","As I have stated in previous questions, I believe that collaboration is an immensely powerful and effective way to make change. To achieve my goal of frequent and free self-defense classes, I will work closely with the Recreation Center’s program leaders and the A.S. financial team. I will work closely with the defense-instructors themselves, to ensure the fulfillment of our needs for this program. To expand the A.S. Food Bank, by creating weekend pop-up locations, I would work with the on-campus A.S. Food Bank, the Food Security & Basic Needs Taskforce, and the Dining & Auxiliary Enterprises. I would like to work with the Food Security & Basic Needs
Taskforce to inquire how food insecurity is affecting our community and collaborate on ideas of how to create meaningful change. Furthermore, I would work with the Dining and Auxiliary
Enterprises to combat food waste issues amongst our dining halls and possibly fill the
off-campus A.S. Food Bank with unused dining hall ingredients and meals. To fulfill my goal of
the Peer Academic Advising Program I would work with the Office of Student Affairs and the
Student Resource Center to establish professionalism and dedicate a space for the program.
Moreover, we would work with official academic advisors for training purposes to ensure
thoughtful and effective advice will be given. It is important to me that we expand these
programs to cater to the diverse student body’s varying interests and concerns.","If remote instruction continues, and even if it does not, I will always make myself available to my constituents with the help of modern technology. Of course I will always be reachable through email, but I would like to also introduce senator office hours. I will create a Zoom link and dedicate two hours a week to directly speak with my constituents; students will be able to sign up for appointments or simply drop in at any time. As many of us have personally experienced, professor office hours are extremely useful and I believe senator office hours would be a great way to gain a better understanding of the diverse student body’s concerns. I believe the office hours will be especially useful for clubs and organizations that are looking for support from the Associated Students to put on events, hold meetings, or spread their platforms. I will post the Zoom link and promote my office hours through social media. Furthermore, social
media will be another mode of communication I use to keep in touch with my constituents. I will
be available through Instagram and Facebook as well. Students can comment directly on my

accounts or private message me through both platforms.","My dedication and eagerness to make a difference in the lives of my peers makes me the best candidate for this position. I would describe myself, and work ethic, as organized, purposeful,
and effective; with those traits I believe I will thrive as an Off-Campus Senator of the 73rd Associated Student Senate. I care deeply for friends, family, and my peers, the members of our
community act as my motivators. If I am given the opportunity and have the power to make a difference, I will not waste any time in doing so. I aim to accurately represent the collective
voice and make changes that our peers actually want to see by collaborating with anyone and everyone who wants to contribute to the betterment of our community. My collaboration skills
make me a great candidate for this position. Working together with other leaders, bouncing ideas off of each other and debating opinions, is one of the most powerful ways to reach a goal. Every
senators’ overarching goal is the betterment of UCSB, with that understanding I will work together with my fellow senators to not only achieve my goals but also help them accomplish their ambitions as well. As a member of a minority group on this campus, the Jewish community, my biggest goal is to make A.S. a more diverse and inclusive space for all, regardless of gender,
sexuality, religion, and all other discriminatory barriers. Historically, positions of power have
only been allocated to privileged groups and I intend to be a part of a more representative senate.","Left-leaning, Centrist",Very Good - I applaud the 72nd A.S. Senate for all their hard work but believe there is always room for improvement.,"No - Divestment is an extremely controversial issue with valid stances from all points of view. I personally would not vote in favor of this resolution. Full transparency: I am a member of the Jewish community, I am against Divestment because the majority of the Jewish community, and I myself, believe the BDS movement to be Anti-Semetic. To clarify, I recognize and sympathize the struggle of the palestinian people; I do not always agree with the Israeli government, but
today many of us have said the same statement regarding the actions of the U.S. government. Peaceful resolution is the ultimate goal, I hope that can be achieved in the near future.","Yes - Ideally I believe that education, whether it be lower or higher education, should be free. I would gladly advocate for the lowering of school tuition and the implementation of more financial aid and scholarships opportunities.","I believe that mental health services at UCSB are somewhat adequate. We have a good amount of resources but they are under-funded. I urge university executives to allocate more funding to broadening CAPS and CARE resources. Equitable accessibility of these resources is especially important to support underprivileged students who cannot financially access private mental healthcare. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, there has been a higher demand for mental health resources and UCSB has a responsibility to respond to those needs. I have personally seen the effects of the inefficiency and under-funding of these programs. A close friend of mine tried to use these resources to their fullest potential, but was faced with a 2 month waitlist. There needs to be a change. It can be difficult for students to build courage and ask for help, and if faced with a type of temporal rejection they may be discouraged and resort to unhealthy modes of dealing with personal issues. Furthermore, I think the services of CAPS and CARE should be promoted to the entire student body, normalizing the idea of asking for help. They should have an individual newsletter that is sent to each student once a week bringing more awareness to their services and events. As senator I will advocate for greater funding of mental health services.","I believe the response to partying in Isla Vista is being handled appropriately. Police shutting
down parties and giving fines to house renters has been adequate so far. I believe stricter rules, such as closing off beaches and creating earlier noise ordinances, would bring down school morale and play a role in deteriorating the mental health of our students. I sympathize that these may seem to be appropriate actions to take, but they are ineffective in preventing large gatherings. In these trying times, I have personally seen the mental deterioration of many peers and believe that the university should be more focused on lifting school morale and overall mental health. I do not believe the university or police should increase fines in these uncertain times when that money needs to be put towards necessities like food and rent. College students are already faced with so many financial burdens, fines simply fosters more financial inequality throughout the university community. This is a controversial topic for the fact that the university is in a compromisable position in which they do not have the jurisdiction to prevent gathering taking place in private households. The university is taking adequate actions against students that have been caught partying within their jurisdiction, and we trust the university to enact future measures that will not greatly widen the financial gap in our community.","I think that Title IX has a good foundation as a response to sexual assault, but is not effective enough. This report system is appropriate, but I believe the university needs a more solid and legal stance against sexual harassment and assault. Once reports have been made, the university should have a more immediate resolution in place. Title IX needs to be modified by putting a greater emphasis on the worth and bravery of sexual assault survivors by helping them promptly. Historically, the voices of sexual assault survivors have been silenced, through encouragment
and support we must change this culture and aid survivors to recieve the justice they deserve.

Sexual assault is never the fault of the victim and the university should ensure transparency that assailants are held fully accountable against university bylaws and federal law. The university must stand in solidarity with sexual assault victims. To further ensure safety on our campus the university should provide easily accessible self defense classes, available to any gender or sexual identity. I believe that the Recreation Center’s self defense program should be free to all students and held each quarter at UCSB. The university should support this type of precautionary measure, as these classes can create an individual sense of security for all. As senator I would invest time and allocate resources to reforming and making the University’s response to sexual harassment and assualt more demanding and proactive.","I cannot speak on behalf of the identities stated in the question, but I do believe that the UCSB community is continuously developing different ways to serve and include the members of historically underrepresented communities. The extremely diverse student body makes UCSB what it is today. As a member of the Jewish community, which has been historically underrepresented, I have first hand witnessed the privilege of certain identities and it is my priority to create a more equitable environment for each identity on this campus. We must protect and support each other. I applaud every resource, club, and organization UCSB has in support of underrepresented groups, but believe there is always room for growth. I commend the Multi-Cultural Center, the Student Resource Building, the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity for creating safe spaces for anyone feeling underrepresented to receive support: academic, emotional, financial and social. These resources must be further publicized to reach their full potentials as accessible community assets. It is important for the university to listen and
respond to the needs of every student, not focusing on one group or another. If elected senator, I will open discussions with groups that need support and find a way to help them succeed in achieving their goals through equity and equality. UCSB has been doing its best to make a more inclusive environment for everyone and I would encourage the university to allocate more funding to the underrepresented groups.","This first bill I plan to author is a bill that would immediately change the everyday lives of students living in Isla Vista. I will invest time into buying and installing technology friendly,
solar powered study tables and place them around the public areas of Isla Vista. Installing these tables would provide residents of Isla Vista with covid-safe outdoor study spaces. I believe these
study spaces will be beneficial to harboring a sense of community. Peers can meet each other and study together outside in a safe way. Houses in Isla Vista are typically small and compact with
people. Many friends have told me that it is typically hard to find a quiet study space in their own homes; these tables will be the solution. With the new capacity restrictions in the library and
students’ personal fears of enclosed spaces, it would be beneficial to install as many outdoor study spaces around Isla Vista as possible. These tables are already placed around the HSSB, on
campus; especially during these times of online instruction, every time I pass by the building I have noticed the tables full. I would make this my first bill because it would be beneficial to the
entire, diverse student body.","It is a goal of mine to erase the idea that the Associated Students is inaccessible to the average student. I will personally work to involve the student body by inviting any and all students to my senator office hours, and will suggest the other senators do the same. I will keep the student body more informed by constantly posting on social media and making my contact information available to all. I will create social media pages and post on Monday of every week to explain what A.S. senators are doing that week, inviting students to the public meetings we will be holding, while creating question and answer forums through comment sections. I think the best
way to promote the average student’s involvement in A.S. is through participation of our events and resources. Therefore, I will encourage students who want to get involved, and personally meet A.S. members, to attend events. Furthermore, I would like to work with the various campus media outlets to display the actions of A.S. and how an average student can get involved. School media outlets will be a great asset to reaching a large and diverse audience, so I would be open to working with them to create more transparency and accessibility.","As senator I will specifically aid the transition back to in-person activities through focusing on the in-person meeting and events of on-campus clubs and organizations. I personally believe that
student-run and student-led organizations are some of the most important components of UCSB; they have the power to bring together like-minded people, harboring an individual’s sense of
belonging, as members build meaningful friendships. Therefore, I would like to help these organizations in organizing safe and effective ways to start in-person meetings. For example, I will work with administration and faculty to allow clubs to use larger than typical meeting spaces on-campus, so entire clubs can meet and still be socially distanced. I can even do something as simple as promoting their meetings on my platforms, to ensure more student engagement. At this very moment in time, I do not know what specifically I will be doing for each organization, as I imagine each one will need aid in different ways, but I could not be more excited and eager to begin the process.","In March of 2019 I, and all other residence hall residents, were forced to leave our new home and friends behind. Leaving campus and not having any idea of when we would return, was extremely difficult for many reasons. Students not only had to leave campus, but also the security found within its equitable resources, fostering a sense of resource inequality between financially able students and those who are not. I feel that during the time of online instruction the university should have allocated more funding to CAPS and CARE so the resources could be accessible to a larger proportion of students. 2 month waitlists is extremely unacceptable and personally I hold the school accountable to expanding these services. In terms of academics I feel as if our community of students and professors have come together and dedicated ourselves to learning from each other in revolutionary ways. Our institutional university did not succeed in handling remote instruction, but rather our community did through communication, collaboration, and innovation. We can all recognize the faults of online instruction, but I would rather focus on congratulating the professors, teaching assistants, and students on their hard work and dedication to continue our mutual education in these revolutionary times.",,,,,,,
Ethan Engler,atmika,On Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162754/ethan-engler.jpg,,He/him/his,1st,Economics,,,"I am running for senator because I, like all of you, have had my past year of college stolen by the COVID-19 pandemic, and as we return to campus, I want to ensure that the 2021-22 school year is all we hoped for and more. I want to compensate for the time the student body lost with a year full of opportunities and events, one that is above and beyond a regular year at UCSB. As your On-Campus Senator, I want to create events and policies welcoming first-years, second-years, and transfer students that have never lived at UCSB; I also want to ramp up the social events and campus involvement opportunities for everyone so that the 2021-22 school year can be truly
exceptional. I also will strive to increase accessibility to campus resources and keep students more in the loop with COVID-related information than in the past year. I’ve been in student government since my sophomore year of high school and I know the importance of hard work, smart planning, and genuine willpower in getting things planned and accomplished. I want to use my skillset to combat the long-standing issues students face as well as new ones introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and I will work to ensure the transition to in-person college goes smoothly and leaves us students truly satisfied with our college experience.","I currently hold two positions on AS. I serve as the Commissioner of Environmental Sustainability for the AS Office of the President. I also serve on the Isla Vista Arts Committee as the IV Live Representative. As the Commissioner of Environmental Sustainability, I also serve as a voting member on The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) Committee, where I review and vote on proposals designed to promote environmental sustainability and “green” policies at UCSB and the surrounding community. In addition, I attend the Chancellor’s Campus Sustainability Committee (CSC) to help coordinate environmental sustainability actions across campus leadership. Through these positions, I have learned how much potential there is to create policies that actually leave an impact; there are significant school resources a leader such as myself can tap into to enrich the community and better students’ lives. As a senator, I will know how to access the school’s resources and work with leadership to get things passed. In addition to the positions I have held, I have also served as a proxy for multiple Senate meetings. I have gained an understanding of the complex and formal system that student leaders must abide by, and have seen by example that despite the complexity it is still extremely possible to make policies happen if you do it efficiently and intelligently. I want to use my experience to be an effective senator, who will actually create events and policies that uphold my platform.","I have several goals I would like to pursue as an On-Campus Senator. For one, many students are unhappy with the existing meal plan policy where if they do not use all of the meals for their meal plans, there is no rollover; extra meals are simply lost forever. As meal plans are very expensive and students will have to rely on them at different levels at different times, I believe there should be a rollover, at least to some degree, for extra meals. I would introduce a bill striving to achieve this. In addition, I would introduce resolutions ensuring a full welcome for second-years and transfer students that were not able to come to campus for their first year. I believe these students should receive the same welcome and opportunities that first-year students typically receive, and I would use resolutions to program events and expand opportunities for these groups. Lastly, I would introduce a resolution to temporarily allocate more funds to campus events and involvement opportunities. As there were no in-person events this year and there is typically a significant budget for this purpose that may have gone untapped, I would attempt to increase the amount of funds devoted to campus involvement for the 2021-22 school year to a temporarily higher level so we can have an even more engaging and memorable year than in pre-pandemic times.","My platform revolves around making the 2021-22 school year exceptional for all students and making sure that campus involvement, student wellbeing, and academic opportunities can truly “bounce back” from the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to expand social events to ensure students feel they are living the college experience, while planning welcoming events and programs to help all new students settle in. I also want to help combat the issues on-campus students face, such as unaffordable meal plans, a serious disconnect caused by the past year, and lacking communication between campus leadership and students. As your senator, I will program and push through social events that will make students feel involved and get the experiences they deserve. I will also strive to increase outreach and transparency within student government, using my own platform (both social media and in-person) to keep students informed and involved with the process. I will work closely with other AS members and organizations to push for consensus goals such as environmental sustainability, greater representation of students, affordability, and community enrichment. Most importantly, I will stay committed to my goal of making the 2021-22 school year have even more memories and opportunities for the student body than a regular year at UCSB.","I know the importance of collaborating with other AS members and entities in order to achieve our common goals. As an On-Campus Senator, I want to expand campus involvement and social events, while also making quality-of-life improvements for on-campus students. I would work closely with the Residence Halls Association to program these events and ensure safety and engagement in the residence halls. I would also attempt to collaborate with administration to
encourage greater outreach of opportunities to students and ensure the transition back to in-person college goes smoothly. Another important part of my platform is improving communication and transparency between AS and the student body, as AS often feels distanced and inaccessible to the students they are supposed to represent. I would work with the Office of the Internal Vice President to encourage greater transparency to the student body, with more
student awareness of the inner workings of AS and more opportunities for students to get involved in the policy process. Regardless of political party, I believe an efficient and discourse-filled AS is ideal for getting good policies passed through, and I believe a collaborative relationship with the Internal Vice President would be a great way to encourage this. I will have no hesitation using my platform to voice the opinions of the students I represent to the organizations I will work with.","While I would be extremely disappointed and frustrated if the administration decided to extend remote instruction into the 2021-22 school year, I would do all I can to stay available to students if worse came to worst. I believe that it is much harder for students to stay engaged with either academics or the community when things are done over the Internet, but I would update my senator instagram constantly to keep students in the loop with COVID-19-related news as well as what is happening within AS. Prior to joining AS, I felt completely disconnected from student government and had no idea how the school was being run; I believe we seriously need to improve our transparency and I would try to personally set an example for this. It is crucial as a senator to represent my constituents, so I would host virtual forums and keep my inbox open to any suggestions or discussions from students, taking their interests into account as much as my own. I would use social media to try to act as a source of information for the students, posting about virtual opportunities, new bills, and the ever-changing policies of the school. As a policymaker, I have much to learn from the students these policies affect, so I would always stay open-minded and eager to hear students’ complaints and ideas.","What makes me an ideal candidate for this position is that I know there are thousands of students in the exact same boat as me right now, and I have the goals and the vision to give these students what they want, the same things I have experienced wanting myself: the experiences and opportunities that come with an in-person education. I have always been a dedicated and outgoing leader, and when I really set my sights on a goal, I don’t stop focusing on it, night and day, until I do what has to be done. My goal as a senator is to make the 2021-22 school year even better than a pre-COVID year at UCSB and give the student body the experience they deserve. I will use my student government experience and aptitude for teamwork to pass bills with other AS leaders that improve our campus and solve student issues, so that this goal can be achieved. At the same time, I will stay laser-focused on my own goal of maximizing student involvement and opportunities for the next year, as well as facilitating the transition back to in-person college for new and isolated students. I can represent the students whose experience was stolen by the pandemic, and who want to maximize the future, because I am one of these students myself, and I will devote my energy to representing these students’ aspirations and interests.",Left-leaning,Fair ,No,No,"I believe that mental health services, while definitely present and invested-in, have much room to improve in order to better suit the needs of the student body. For one, mental health resources at UCSB tend to be insulated from student government and as a result don’t communicate or work with AS as much as would be ideal; it is hard for the voices of the student body to influence our mental health programs if there is not sufficient communication and discourse. I would support bills that increase the transparency and accessibility of these programs, as well as encourage students to voice their opinions on the school’s services so they can improve. I also would support an expansion or streamlining of the resources so students don’t have to wait as long to reach help; many crises require immediate attention but do not get it due to significant waitlines. Mental health services must be timely and easy to reach and I would support bills that promote this. As we return to campus and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, many students going through the transition will likely face new issues that require mental health support; I believe we should tailor and expand our programs to help students deal with the transition smoothly.","There were certainly violations of social distancing protocols, at UCSB and at colleges around the country, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. I personally believe the university would have had significantly more power in mitigating these instances if they had opened on-campus housing in the fall; their last-second cancellation of the housing contracts led to a more crowded and partying-susceptible Isla Vista. In addition, the university established little to no deterrents to partying in Isla Vista, mostly staying completely distanced from the issue. While I understand that the university could not directly stop partying in private residences of Isla Vista, I do believe the administration could have worked more closely with county officials and police to shut down large gatherings, with most occurring with no consequences. As for Greek life, if official Greek organizations were credibly suspected of hosting large gatherings, university or county officials should have investigated further and at the very least given fines to hosts rather than ignoring the issue. There was certainly a lack of communication from the administration about partying and large gatherings, with the scope of the issue largely unclear to outsiders. Greater communication with students, deterrents, and law enforcement could have mitigated this issue.","I am a strong supporter of Title IX and all university initiatives to combat gender discrimination and/or sexual assault. The anonymity of complaints and reportings is crucial, and I support the university’s strong stance against retaliation for any complaints. However, I believe Title IX can be improved yet; there should be harsher regulations to ensure people can’t find loopholes to get away with sexual assault or discrimination. It is important that crucial policies such as those of Title IX are enforced effectively and consistently, and I will support policies that achieve this end. The university must hold individuals accountable and never turn a blind eye to an incident of sexual assault. I also believe we should expand mental health resources to sexual assault survivors, and make sure that they can access suitable mental health support in a timely manner. Lastly, I would support a further expansion of education on the subject of sexual assault. While the required online lesson about sexual assault is informative and important, I believe there is more we can do, be it through AS events, social media campaigns, or university-run education. Both prevention concepts and accessibility to resources must be publicized through these policies, and I will promote bills that get information and resources out there.","I believe there is always more that can be done to help underrepresented groups that feel their voices aren’t being heard. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the inequalities among different groups and has served as a reminder that we have a long way to go to truly uphold our values of equality and fairness. While I am proud to see the amount of programs and policies dedicated to serving underrepresented groups at UCSB, many students in these groups have been isolated from these programs by the COVID-19 pandemic. As we return to campus, I would work to connect underrepresented students to UCSB’s programs, be it through social media communications, personally encouraging organizations to expand outreach, or voting for equitable legislation as a senator. I would keep myself open to any suggestions or information from students in underrepresented groups about the struggles they are facing in the transition back to campus and how myself and other senators can use our platforms to support them. I would also support bills that lead to equitability of opportunities and outcomes. As an important part of my platform is community involvement and social events, I would also work to ensure anything I program is as inclusive as possible.","The first resolution I plan to author as a senator is a resolution allocating increased funds to campus involvement and community events for the 2021-22 school year. The COVID-19 pandemic has left our students isolated, lacking in community, and robbed of the important experiences that come with in-person college. As I’ve previously stated, a large part of my platform is ramping up the campus involvement opportunities and social events for the 2021-22 school year to give students a year that is exceptional rather than underwhelming as we return to campus; I aim to make the college experience of students even more full than during a regular year at UCSB. As much of last year’s campus involvement and event funding has likely gone untapped, I would like to temporarily increase this year’s funding for that purpose so that we will not have to compromise in our transition back to campus. With an increase in funds, I hope to program new events such as outreach events to help get more students into clubs and organizations, additional welcome events for first-years, second-years, and transfer students that have never lived on campus, and campus-wide artistic and academic events that will make the student body come together. Of course, the nature of these events will have to depend on the current pandemic guidelines of the university and county, but I believe it is likely we will have some degree of in-person freedom and can make quality events that give students the
opportunities and experiences they lacked in the previous year.","Prior to joining AS, I was completely unaware of how it worked or if it was even possible to get involved. I’m sure many other students feel the same way, and that the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this issue. A big part of my platform is accessibility and transparency, so I want to make the policymaking process clear and connected to the student body. I will post frequently on my social media as a senator to let students know what policies are being considered and what goals I am currently working to achieve. I will also attempt to host forums where students can let me know their ideas, complaints, and comments so I can represent them in the Senate. My social media and inbox will always be open to messages as well, and I will make sure to voice this to students. I believe that the campus administration seriously failed with their communication last summer when they cancelled fall housing contracts just weeks before move-in, and as a result I would always be looking for new pandemic-related information and keeping students informed through my social media. Lastly, as college likely will be in-person for the fall quarter, I will let the people on campus with me know they can always approach me with any questions or comments about AS, and that I will listen with an open mind because there’s no better way to know how the student body is doing than to hear it from them first-hand.","I believe that the transition back to in-person instruction and activity in Isla Vista is actually a huge opportunity. Depending on the way we handle it, this transition can either be viewed as a “complicated” version of the regular college experience, or it can be viewed as even better than a normal year at UCSB. I believe that through social events, greater outreach, and more opportunities to come together as a community, this year can go down in UCSB history. I would program and push for multiple welcome events for first-years, second-years, and transfer students that have never lived on campus. I would also strive to program new social events and campus traditions, and personally act as a proponent to any community engagement opportunities, be it artistic, academics-based, or social. As students would likely face new challenges brought on by the transition, I would encourage students to contact me with their complaints and suggestions then represent them in Senate and promote policies that smooth the transition. By connecting students to opportunities, using my platform to spread optimism, and creating events that will give students the “college experience,” I will aim to make the transition to normalcy memorable and enjoyable for all students.","I believe that the university’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and remote instruction has been a mixed bag. The university’s biggest failure, in my opinion, was the last-second housing cancellation in the fall quarter, just weeks before move-in. This move was irresponsible and unfair to the student body, with the news coming so late that many students (such as myself) had already bought furniture for their dorms or apartments, and RA’s in particular about two weeks
from move-in. University officials were also extremely hard to contact throughout this year, even in important times, with many campus agencies shutting down their phone lines and limiting operations despite receiving the same resources and having the same importance as other years. In addition, many remote classes made no effort to keep students involved, with several Zooms
being nothing but black screens or an asynchronous video. It is extremely important to keep students engaged in online education, and while some classes certainly achieved this through discussions and interactivity, others made no effort and left students with a lackluster and weak education. On the other hand, the university did an extremely good job of establishing COVID-19 testing and tracking resources, as well as participating in the vaccination effort. There was also a consistent effort to get students involved through online social events and email outreach to university programs, which was likely very helpful to isolated students. The university did what they could to get students involved and keep them protected, but had significant failures in communication and accountability. As a senator, I will work to keep students more in the loop with pandemic-related policies so similar failures will not be repeated.",,,,,,,

My dream job is to be a congressman or assemblyman. I am passionate about seemingly everything—reforming mandatory minimums, infrastructure, social safety nets, voter participation, reparations—so to have a job where I can have a voice to address all of these issues and more sounds too good to be true. I guess it is sometimes, since government is can be notoriously slow and unproductive. Being part of the student government is extremely similar to that, so I am pretty excited about the possibility of landing the job. Government in general, and student government specifically, has so much potential for good that it has the power to make you feel optimistic as well. I think it would be a good thing too, to have someone like me in the senate. I mean because I am a transfer student and an undocumented dreamer and DACA recipient from Mexico. Those are historically underrepresented, and the student government should look like the people they govern, so to speak. That is why there is such a thing as an
international senator now. Why there is a transfer senator. I like the idea of there being a requirement for diversity, and I hope the idea extends to other groups, like maybe a black senator or a LGBTQ+ senator.","This past academic year was my first, so I have never lived in Santa Barbara. But I am more than willing to learn and understand the needs of those living in university-owned housing. I would like to establish the legacy or the precedent, that the uni-owned senator is one that always highly involved with and has a direct line of contact to her or his constituents. As a student for the past year, I have come to know the difficulties of remote learning that all students have had to go through, and when we do come back, the difficulties I have my
constituents will also have. The rest is my job to find out and address. I live far away from my community college, so it was difficult to get involved, but I was an honors advocate. A job in which students in honors classes were essentially my constituents and it was my job to report any concerns they might have had to leadership. From there on, the other advocates and I would think of ways to solve the conflict at hand, whether it was a solution or resolving to speak to someone with a little more power than ourselves. It was the closest thing I could get to that resembled the senate, and I really enjoyed it.",,,,"Should remote instruction continue, not much would change, because in person meetings with constituents can be logistically difficult. As I explain in a later question, I would still plan to have a website as well as promoting my social media, which is more accessible to everyone. ","What makes me the best candidate is my passion for government, and my strong desire to do the job, which is essentially my dream job like I mentioned before. I know what it is like to live without relief from your government, and I think maybe that is why I just become passionate about every issue that the government could potentially resolve. I mean I really like studying everything from food waste to foreign policy to recycling.",Left-leaning,"Good - Academics and financial expenses, long priorities, have turned into serious emergencies, and although the senate has done a lot of good work to address the dilemma of grading during a pandemic, it was also the senate’s responsibility to move faster and to achieve more. The P/NP option for major courses should have been represented as a right. GPAs are important and future employers and admissions officers will know that these were unprecedented times. Financially, A.S. has discretion over millions in student fees that continue to be collected. Now more than ever, students should know what they’re paying for.","Yes - I should say that I am new and haven’t heard enough perspectives on the matter yet; but from what I’ve been able to gather, divestment is most importantly an issue of human rights. It would affect many passionate parties, but there is probably no greater issue than human rights. Any investments made with violators are simply morally wrong, and should be dissolved. This issue includes our campus, but it also goes far beyond it, so UCSB should be part of a louder voice that asserts the rights and the respect that every global citizen deserves.","Yes - It isn’t right that young students should have to figure out how to go about paying a small fortune for a higher education. The U.S. is one of the biggest economies in the world, and California alone is a big part of that. The least that the state or the federal government could do is relieve the burden of perpetually increasing tuition costs, most especially in areas like Santa Barbara where housing accounts for most or all of a student’s budget. Personally, if I had paid housing this year, I would have needed every loan offered and then some.","I honestly think they are pretty great. I’ve never been part of an institution or organization that cares about mental health so much, and I myself have used and continue to use UCSB mental health services. Having said that though—I think the school may be better at delivering mental health services on the communal level as opposed to the individual level. Holding group exercises can intimidate and keep out people who otherwise really do need help. I also think it would be great for services to find a way to make students feel seen and understood through some form of one on one contact, instead of just being put in a Zoom mindfulness workshop where supervisors hope they can be helpful to all participants, at the same time and in one way. A lot of what would improve the mental health of students is out of the department’s control, which often makes mental health services a reactionary measure, so I sometimes think it would be nice if services took more preventative measures, again, on the individual level. We are a large and diverse group of individuals who have each been through many different things, so sometimes group work isn’t the answer—at least not at first.","Many of the students I would represent as Uni-Owned Senator are transfers like myself, and no one is more infuriated at the complete disregard of violators than transfers, since their time at UCSB is already traditionally short. Many, including me, will not get the opportunity to live in and see UCSB this year at all. Everyone wants to come back, so I understand the anger for such selfish people, and the fact that these gatherings were able to happen does suggests that these organizations could have done better.

I’d like to acknowledge that the entire student body has not been told how widespread the problem was or is. For one, we were told that there were outside people or students coming to Isla Vista, so they would fall under the jurisdiction of the county, which means the police did fail to patrol and monitor and prevent. Jail time should not be an option at all though because of the collective risk of jailing people during a pandemic. They would pose a risk to officers, to cell partners, and to the entire community, making the punishment sort of hypocritical. As for Greek
life, leaders were advised against breaking COVID restrictions, and so the responsibility would and should fall on them. But I can’t support any fiscal punishment, at least not as the first resort. It is unethical in the context of an expensive town filled with college students enduring a pandemic.

As a senator, I would favor instead a form of moral punishment, like having violators
patrol Isla Vista with the help of the police or some other good old-fashioned community service. This form of punishment works better and it is the ethically right thing to do. ","As an institution that receives federal funding, the Title IX office ensures UCSB is compliant with all federal regulations on sexual violence, but also state regulations—preventive and reactionary. It is the office a student or staff member would report an incident of sexual violence to, and they in turn handle your case and provide resources along with CARE. I don’t like this question, because I have never experienced sexual assault, so I can’t even begin to speak for those who have, especially as a male. I will say that I have four sisters and three of them have been sexually harassed time after time, so I am passionate about the issue, as well as disgusted by mankind sometimes. There is a lot to do about the current enabling culture, from very small to very big things. For example, I think the Uni-Owned Senator should achieve the hiring of trained prevention staff to work in housing. Their presence alone is a preventative measure, but they will also be trained in reacting to sexual assault victims. They would collaborate with RAs instead of having RAs deal with by themselves what has probably been the hardest part of their jobs. I’d like to add that it will be my constituents who determine the character of my advocacy in the senate, so what they want and need is what I will push for. They are all, together the experts on what needs to change. My job is to listen and oblige. ","I would have to say no. I can give my story as a broader example of what the university is doing wrong with underrepresented students. I was born in Mexico to very poor parents, neither of which went to college, so my siblings and I weren’t exactly cultivated for success in college — or even just college. This is the case with all other underrepresented students. We don’t have the same knowledge and preparation as other students may. Transition to the quarter system here, for instance, was really hard for me. I may have dropped one or two classes. That wouldn’t have been the case if maybe the school had a program to teach us about college work and life. When I was applying to UCs, I was wondering if I was wasting my time, because I just didn’t have the money to pay for it, even with loans included. That feeling persisted until the very day I started at UCSB, no matter how many people I talked to at multiple UCs. I feel like there should have been someone to reach out to me about my situation, because I can see why someone in my situation would have given up on the idea of university all together. Once enrolled though, I learned about transfer peer mentors and staff mentors for undocumented students and places to talk to groups of students with similar circumstances. I found a lot of resources for DREAMers especially, some for transfers, some for LGBTQ+, but I have never heard of any resources for black or indigenous students.","Pragmatically, the first bill I would author would have to be in favor of establishing a framework in which Residential Advisor contracts would have security. That could be in the form of guaranteed housing after a certain period of time has passed that would make it a burden for RAs to find alternative housing. UCSB housing would not agree to give contracts absolutely security, because we have seen how sideways things can go, but RAs should be able to trust that they will have a place to live even if their contracts are terminated. Besides that, RA tasks are varied, they do a lot for the school and that should be recognized by at least giving them the right to safe working conditions should the school decide to employ them. As the employer, UCSB housing bears responsibility for the people who trusted them. And it should have always been like this, so I will also be at the forefront of making legislation that outlines the grievances it committed this year and demand accountability. If something like this goes unanswered, it sets a precedent that the university saves itself before it saves its students and staff.","I think the Uni-Owned Housing Senator has to develop relationships with the RAs. As part of their job they could set up a meeting of their residents in which I could introduce myself, exchange contact information, and let them know that I will be in contact with their RA, so any concern they have they could also tell their RA. It could be a more convenient option, and RAs really get to know their residents as the year progresses, so they are invaluable sources of
information. I definitely agree that it is difficult to get information about the proceedings of the senate, but I don’t know yet if I would use social media or make a website to keep students informed. Social media would probably reach more people in a very easy way, but a website could include more information in an organized way. Knowing myself, I will probably do both, and I would promote my website on every floor if they let me. I think what will also help is that it is my job to work for them, so I need them to do my job. If I don’t know about something, like resources for indigenous students, it is my job to seek out those who manage those services and those who are being affected. In other words, I will find you, and I will help you.","We will probably still be in a pandemic, towards the end of one but still in one, which means safety protocols will have to be followed. Things like this, that involved entire communities, have to be addressed at every level, and the messaging has to be consistent. I will be part of that messaging, promoting the safety regulations we all have to follow so that we can be and stay on campus.
Of the people I would represent, those who have never been to UCSB before are essentially going to need four years’ worth of services and support. They are going to be thrown into a chaos, and they will have to adapt faster than everyone else, because they only have so much time before graduation. I can’t give them back the time they’ve lost, but I can try my best to make sure they leave the school with a general sense of gratitude and preparedness. There are also things that we have gained during remote learning that I think students should be able to keep, like recorded lectures, saved lecture presentations, virtual office hours, and take-home finals and midterms, because they better reflect our true ability versus having to memorize a lot of information and then synthesize it into an A+ essay in an hour or so.","UCSB housing recalled more than 130 RA contracts two weeks before they were meant to move in. They had nowhere to go because two weeks prior is too late to find other housing. And what is more, the RAs who were able to stay were not immediately provided with safe working conditions in COVID times. UCSB essentially took advantage of the fact that they needed work done and RAs needed housing. The good thing about this is that it showed us what changes to RA contracts need to be demanded in the future. Like many other universities though, the transition to remote education was surprisingly smooth, although the same cannot be said about the grading system. The university should have quickly granted a P/NP option for major courses, amongst other things like broadening class - dropping prerogatives. It would have sent a message to employers and to other universities that, for many reasons, these are very difficult times for everyone, so leniency and adaption should be embraced. They have succeeded though in easing student access to internet and laptops for school. Student services are virtually absent, and yet still there for students, remotely. And the school has really made an effort to host virtual events thereby encouraging responsible quarantine activities.",,,,,,,
Avital Rutenburg,atmika,L&S Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162657/avital-rutenburg.jpg,,She/her/hers,3rd,Philosophy,,,"Serving with the 73rd senate is a privilege that not many students get to experience. I would love to spend my last year at UCSB giving back to the student body in any way I can. As the daughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants, I have a strong appreciation for the unparalleled community and opportunities offered at UCSB. Coming from the Bay Area where I was surrounded by people who similarly and openly struggled with anxiety and depression, I came into college equipped with tools to better my mental health. Unfortunately, mental health is still a taboo topic in many communities. Especially after the difficult and isolating year we all faced, it is important that student fees are allocated toward promoting our psychological well-being. As Senator, I will advocate for the students’ needs and voice their concerns in topics such as this one. I have been involved in the UCSB community in a lot of other areas and am eager to use the knowledge I have acquired to represent the diverse student body and its wide range of needs. The fact that A.S. is privileged with a significant portion of student fees comes with the responsibility of being transparent in their actions and basing decisions off of student sentiments. It’s important that we prioritize outreach and publicize A.S. affairs in order to best and most honestly serve the student body. The budget they are allotted grants the senate the power to make substantial change and should not be abused.","I was a Campus Associate for the Amazon locker over the past year and interacted with a diverse range of Isla Vista residents. Having worked for a highly customer-driven company, I learned a lot about how to effectively interact with people. Additionally, this role requires a strong work ethic and the ability to balance several tasks in a timely, efficient manner. I currently work as an associate at a worker’s compensation law firm where I have gained the skills necessary to work together with other people to accomplish a common goal. I have also fallen in love with the idea of using my privileged position to represent the interests of other people and assist them in any way I can. Being elected senator would allot me the privilege of serving the student body in a similar manner. Furthermore, I am currently Vice President of TAMID Group which is a club that offers members experiential business learning. Coordinating the logistics of a large club on campus equipped me with the leadership skills necessary for serving as senator. Finally, I was a campaign manager in the election in 2019 and learned a lot about how the Senate functions in the process. While I have space to learn and grow more and am eager to do so as Senator, my wide range of experiences working and interacting with the Isla Vista community has prepared me well.","One of the greatest challenges facing students is access to mental health resources. Especially during this time, it's important that the psychological well being of students is supported. I will introduce a bill to allocate more funds toward CAPS so they can expand their services and potentially hire professional counselors. I will also promote already offered wellness activities and introduce many new events and services. I have personally benefited from many of the resources, services, and events the Mental Health Peer Program offers to cope with stress and anxiety. With more funding those can be expanded to further address mental health needs and publicized to reach the entire student body. I will also address students’ basic-need insecurities by assisting the A.S. Food Bank in expanding its locations to promote accessibility. I plan on introducing a bill to create a food bank near the library so students have more immediate access to its services at a more convenient location. It is important that we make the services accessible to any student that is of need. As school has shifted to remote instruction and many students are not on campus, it would be beneficial to offer a delivery service in which products can be shipped to students who are not able to access the food bank themselves. Nourishing your body with proper fuel is necessary for academic success and should be freely available to anyone who is food insecure. I also want to introduce a system within A.S. to post the minutes of our meetings weekly as well as publicize the agenda of future meetings so students can reach out to
senators with their opinions, ideas, and concerns. This will ensure transparency within A.S. and engage students more closely with the affairs of the senate. I also want to promote environmentally-sustainable practices and minimize the school's carbon footprint by introducing resolutions such as a compost system on campus. As senator, I would work with environmentally-driven organizations and clubs as it is our collective duty to make UCSB as green of a campus as possible.","My platform consists of five main goals. Firstly, I want to expand mental health resources such as CAPS, CARE, and H&W. I will introduce a bill to increase funding for CAPS to promote the Mental Health Peer Program and hire professional counselors. While it’s important that Zoom sessions are offered to students who don’t feel comfortable with or can’t come into the center, therapy is a highly intimate process that can be much more helpful to people in person. I will work to open the CAPS location for in-person sessions to students who prefer this option (this will be done following COVID safety guidelines). I will also work with mental health clubs on campus to create events such as the massage service offered on campus before the pandemic and group painting sessions. These events would also be held in accordance with CDC guidelines to ensure that physical safety is not compromised in the process of bettering mental health. I also plan to reallocate student fees to support underfunded departments as well as returning
unnecessary funds to students. This past year has been not only emotionally but also financially devastating to many. It’s important to recognize that while A.S. is able to create important and essential changes with the budget they are allotted, reducing student fees wherever possible would arguably be one of the most beneficial changes. Although I do believe many departments on campus have long been under-represented, there are others that are disproportionately funded. I will also support food-insecure students by assisting the A.S. Food Bank in expanding its locations and services. While the bank attempts to reach the entire student body that is of need, it isn’t accessible to everyone. For students that are able to come back to campus, it would be extremely beneficial if a location was created closer to the library where it would be highly publicized, available, and convenient. A delivery service should be introduced to assist students who will not be able to return to campus and want products to be shipped to their remote location. I will also promote environmentally-sustainable practices such as creating a campus-wide compost system to minimize the school’s carbon footprint. Finally, I will increase transparency by basing decisions off of student sentiments and publicizing A.S. affairs with posts detailing weekly meetings.","To achieve my first platform goal, I plan on working with CAPS, CARE, and H&W which are all UCSB entities that address various aspects of student mental health needs. I will also work with Active Minds which is a registered campus organization that empowers students to speak up about mental health. To address the reallocation of student fees I will work with individual departments to learn about their needs and investigate where funds are unnecessary or over-supplied. I will also communicate with the student body directly to discover where they want their fees to be allocated and which entities they don’t want to fund. I will work with the A.S. Food Bank directly to create a new location on campus as well as to introduce the delivery service. In my pursuit of reducing UCSB’s carbon footprint I will work with organizations such as Clean Consulting at UCSB, Collective for Clean Energy, IVTP, and others to come up with changes we can make to create a green campus. I will also work with IVCC to establish an on-campus compost system. FInally, to create a more transparent A.S. I will work directly with my fellow senators to publicize our affairs.","If the remote instruction continues in the 2021-2022 school year, I will make myself actively available to my constituents by offering Zoom office hours for periods of time that are convenient for as large of a percent of the student body as possible. I sympathize with students who are studying in remote locations with different time zones and will make myself available during hours that extend beyond the work hours of UCSB’s time zone. I will also publicize and make myself readily available on a plethora of social media and communication platforms to ensure that students can reach me in whatever way is most convenient for them.","I am the best candidate for this position because I want to serve the student body for selfless, genuine, and altruistic reasons. I am motivated by my desire to create lasting change on a campus that, while having a lot to be proud of, has several areas it can improve to ensure that every student body is being assisted and listened to. Especially after losing the full experience of attending UCSB for an entire year, I am passionate about ensuring that my last year is as
impactful and involved as it can be. I am eager to interact with as many of my fellow Gauchos as possible and to learn about the diverse range of concerns, ideas, and needs that I would have the privilege of voicing and addressing. While having the potential to greatly benefit our campus and community, my platform is extremely feasible and specific. The specifics of a platform are meaningless, however, if the candidate does not have the work-ethic or personal drive to carry
what they promise to do. It is important that no elected representative takes for granted the power they are so lucky to be granted by their constituents. I will passionately and wholeheartedly accomplish my goals without ever getting comfortable in a “warm seat.”",Left-leaning,Fair - The 72nd Senate was tasked with addressing the needs of the student body during one of the most difficult times of our lives. They did what they could to assist a population that was far removed while undergoing the same challenges themselves. It is unfair to judge them under the same standards that you would in previous circumstances as this was uncharted territory for everyone. All we can do now is take what we have learned after a year amidst the pandemic and use that knowledge to better address the needs that were already present and have recently been exaggerated.,No - This topic is highly complicated and controversial as it pertains to an important part of many students’ identities including myself. It is important that people are educated on the issue especially when deciding their opinion on a movement that there is a lot of misinformation being circulated about. I don't claim to know everything and am always further educating myself as well as keeping an open ear to other opinions.,"No - While in an ideal world college tuition would be free and accessible to anyone, I don’t believe that is feasible under the current economic system of the United States. I fully support lowering student fees as much as possible especially in times such as these where most resources are not available to students. My answer to this question is an idealistic yes but a
realistic no.","Mental Health services at UCSB are not adequate. With more funding, CAPS can expand its services and hire professional counselors. Additionally, funding is required to be able to safely open in-person services that are much more effective in addressing mental health needs. The Mental Health Peer Program offered massage chairs and other stress-alleviating services before the pandemic that could be opened up and expanded to accommodate for more students and do so safely. Moreover, the lack of socialization and human interaction in recent times has contributed to the rise of mental health problems. This can be addressed by working with organizations on campus to create socially distanced events to allow students to meet new people and interact more intimately with their fellow Gauchos. Some potential events could be painting sessions, ice cream socials, or movie nights. Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression
have been stigmatized in many communities to the point where many students come to UCSB without the tools to even vocalize what they are going through. It is important that we offer events where students can openly discuss what so many go through. Especially during especially stressful times such as midterm weeks, dead week, and finals week, services such as the professional massages and tea-snack bar that were previously offered should be expanded upon.","The response to partying in Isla Vista definitely could have been handled better by the University. While the emails sent to students informing them of COVID updates, policy,changes, and urging them to follow CDC guidelines were important to spread important information, they did not accurately account for the psychology of college students. Ideally, students would avoid partying out of a personal desire and a sense of moral obligation. Having lived in Isla Vista during a large portion of the pandemic due to work, I personally saw that this hope was not a reality. Sending letters to houses that throw parties and sending strongly worded emails unfortunately does little to deter them from continuing their actions. The school could have worked with local police to introduce a three strike policy in which students involved with large gatherings would receive warnings before an ultimate punishment of either suspension or expulsion if the problem persisted.","I am familiar with the university’s extremely important Title IX office and its functions. It is the duty of the university to advocate for and show support for survivors. Expanding resources that give survivors a safe place to speak up and find support as well as demanding accountability should be a priority. The school can collaborate with and support organizations such as SASA, STESA, and CARE to create safe spaces for survivors to speak up, receive emotional support, and communicate with others with similar experiences. It is also vital the the school offers a way in which students can report sexual assault cases comfortaly and in whatever manner they prefer. This includes offering anonymous reporting and avoiding police involcemnt upon student request.","There is definitely more UCSB can do to effectively serve historically underrepresented groups. While Chancellor Yang’s emails during times when showing support to certain communities is especially important are necessary, we are not doing nearly enough. The voices of members of these specific communities should be amplified and we should show school-wide solidarity when tragedies occur. I understand this was difficult to do during the pandemic and remote instruction but we would be more effectively serving these communities if we allowed their members to reach the student body personally. Additionally, certain departments such as Black Studies, Asian American Studies, Chicano Studies, and many others are largely underfunded. The university should also work more closely with clubs dedicated to these underrepresented groups to publicize their events and increase the scope of their impact.","If I was elected to serve on the A.S. Senate, the first bill I would author is one that reallocates funding to CAPS to safely open the services to allow students to come in person. While remote forms are fairly adequate in serving other categories of students needs, mental health resources are significantly less beneficial over an online format. There are ways in which CAPS could offer its services while still doing so in accordance with CDC guidelines. This would require expansions that more funding could allow for. Furthermore, more funding toward CAPS could allow the organization to hire professional counselors, expand programs such as the MHP Program, and introduce new events and services. While UCSB has never adequately provided for student mental health needs, it is especially imperative that they do so after the recent rise in worldwide mental health concerns due to the pandemic.","If remote instruction continues, I will make myself actively available to my constituents by offering Zoom office hours for periods of time that are convenient for as large of a percent of the student body as possible. I sympathize with students who are studying in remote locations with different time zones and will make myself available during hours that extend beyond the work hours of UCSB’s time zone. I will also publicize and make myself readily available on a plethora of social media and communication platforms to ensure that students can reach me in whatever way is most convenient for them. The fact that A.S. is privileged with a significant portion of
student fees comes with the responsibility of being transparent in their actions and basing decisions off of student sentiments. It’s important that we prioritize outreach and publicize A.S. affairs in order to best and most honestly serve the student body. A specific step I will take to keep students informed about the affairs of A.S. is to introduce a system to post the minutes of the meetings weekly. These posts will include what was discussed throughout the meeting
including what was said by each individual so students can reach out to specific members as they
see fit. I will also publicize the agenda of future meetings so students can reach out to senators
with their opinions, ideas, and concerns before the topics are discussed.","As senator, I will aid in the transition back to in-person instruction and activity by reallocating funds to resources that more pressingly necessitate in-person capacities. If certain activities are not yet safe to open up in a non-remote manner, student fees should be shifted away from those and toward the resources that will be opened. Moreover, I will ensure that safety guidelines are being followed to ensure that the spread of COVID-19 does not result from the transition. It is also important that we recognize the emotional and social impacts of the last year of isolation.
Many students have suffered from mental health issues as a result of social deprivation and
events should be hosted that encourage students to meet each other safely. After the transition
back to in-person, I personally hope to take advantage of the many resources I used to take for
granted and make the most of my time on campus. I want to make that possible for other students
by expanding and promoting activities that are safe to allow and introducing events that students
voice a desire for.","The university succeeded in remaining closed when it was not safe to offer in-person instruction. While remote learning was not ideal for anyone, there was a more pressing issue at hand that I am glad the school shifted its learning style to accommodate for. Certain departments and teachers were also incredibly supportive and flexible during this difficult timing in offering accommodations such as the pass/no pass option for major classes. From personal experience, several teachers were extremely understanding and did what they could to lessen our burden as students. The school could have done more to punish students involved with partying in Isla Vista which became a “covid hotspot” as a result. Had UCSB worked with Isla Vista police to introduce a more serious policy around breaking guidelines, students may have been deterred from throwing large gatherings that directly led to the spread of the virus. Although there are ways the system could have been further improved, Student Health was extremely useful in
providing free testing for students at relatively convenient locations. The weekly free and
available appointments at several local locations were introduced late in the pandemic and could have been extremely beneficial earlier on. I recognize that this could have been the result of many factors that are unavoidable during uncharted and unexpected circumstances. Finally, the school should have lowered its fees having closed the campus and all of its resources. Especially during a difficult time financially for many families and individuals, it was an added burden and unreasonable that students were expected to pay full tuition for online classes.",,,,,,,

I am passionate about social change and I want to use my platform to serve all students and advocate for underrepresented groups. When I am elected senator, I will represent all Gauchos equally. My running platform focuses on providing students with increased academic and mental health resources, and ensuring that all students have a voice on campus. I want to enable unity and cohesion within our campus by advocating for increased transparency and tolerance within campus organizations. Great strides have been made in creating an equitable environment for students of all backgrounds and identities, but there is still room for improvement and further progress in unifying our campus community. As a Senator I want to make sure that all students feel welcome at our university, and can be confident that their voices will be heard and their needs will be met. This has been a difficult time for many and I understand the challenges that we all face, and I promise you that I will do my best to serve as your senator.","As a first year I believe that my outside perspective will aid me in my ability to identify
opportunities and issues within our campus community, and implement solutions that will
positively impact our student body. While I have not had the opportunity to experience our campus in person, this last year and my first three quarters navigating our virtual campus model have provided me with a unique understanding of what can be improved to aid all students in their academic careers. As a member of the Engaging Humanities program, the interdisciplinary work that I have done has helped me expand my awareness of underrepresented groups, the obstacles they continue to face, and how I can become a better ally. I know this will serve me well as a senator because I have become more aware of myself and the role that I can play as an advocate for historically underrepresented groups. Furthermore, as a first-generation college student, I understand the need for support and guidance throughout your academic journey, and
the difficulties of navigating the university model. I pride myself on my ability to understand issues from the perspectives of others, and I believe my outside perspective and open-minded approach will serve me well as a senator.","As a Letters and Science Senator, one of the first bills I want to introduce will extend academic advising hours and increase the number of advisors. It has been difficult for students to receive
the right guidance in a timely manner due to the pandemic and our remote working and learning environments. The current system works for students who have questions that can be answered quickly, but the portion of students who need help with more substantial questions, regarding their major or course plans, often face a longer wait time when signing up for advising. I believe that my plan will help students receive advising in a timely manner and alleviate the stress of
trying to navigate their academic careers. The second bill I plan to introduce will bolster the mental health resources offered through CAPs by extending their assessment hours, their virtual appointment hours, and increasing the staff. In doing so students will have more flexibility in their own schedules and be able to access these resources more frequently. By increasing the staff, this will decrease the wait time and increase the number of students that can be seen daily. The third bill I will introduce will prevent tuition hikes and eliminate unnecessary student fees through the creation of independent solutions and the reallocation of funds to address resource deficits.","My platform consists of five points, aka my A PLUS plan. I will advocate for more proactive mental health programs to reach students of all demographics and those who are in most need of assistance. While the mental health services offered at UCSB address certain concerns, the limited hours available for virtual consultations need to be extended so that more students can go to drop-in appointments. I hope to work with CAPs to adjust their hours and UCSB Mental Health taskforce to continue reaching students with pertinent information and resources regarding mental health. I will prevent tuition hikes and eliminate unnecessary student fees by coming up with independent solutions in order to make college more affordable. I hope to work with campus administrators to seek out other resources for funding so that we can decrease
student costs. I will listen to the concerns of our student body and advocate for solutions that properly address the needs of our campus community. I believe that in order to do my job as a senator effectively, I need to listen to the ideas and suggestions of my constituents so that I can propose solutions that meet student needs. I will unify our school through outreach programs and open conversations that promote understanding and awareness. I want to make sure that all students feel a sense of belonging and are a part of our campus community, and I will meet with leaders of campus groups and organizations to better understand how I can address their needs. I will support innovative ideas and initiatives by reallocating funds towards and increasing
accessibility to academic resources for students. I believe that it is important to listen and promote ideas that will have a positive impact on our UCSB community. I plan on working with administrators to redistribute funds to academic resources and services that are most used, so that we can ensure there are no limitations on what is accessible to students.","For my bill to prevent tuition increases and eliminate unnecessary student fees, I hope to work with campus administration, specifically the College of Letters and Science, to reallocate funds to address resource deficits so that we can increase resource accessibility for students. I believe that we can come up with independent solutions to decrease the cost of tuition for students while maintaining the services and resources offered through our university. I hope to work with CAPs
on my bill to increase their virtual assessment hours, appointment hours, and staff, so we can decrease wait time and increase the number of students that can be seen daily. I want to make sure that students can access these resources frequently and I hope to work with the UCSB Mental Health Taskforce so we can continue reaching out to students and providing them with information regarding what mental health resources are available. In regards to my third bill-
increasing the number of academic advisors and extending advising hours, I hope to work with the college of Letters and Science along with the major departments and advisors within this entity. In doing so I plan to increase availability of academic advising resources for students to help minimize the stress of academic planning.","I believe listening to the ideas and concerns of constituents is essential to effectively carrying out my responsibilities as an L&S Senator. With the possibility of remote instruction continuing in the 2021-2022 school year, it is important that all students know that their opinions, ideas and concerns matter to me. I will hold bi-weekly zoom office hours and I will be available for appointments scheduled outside of these hours so that constituents can reach me multiple times throughout the week depending on availability in their own schedules. I believe social media is a great asset and I will use my senator Instagram to post relevant information concerning senate affairs and to keep students informed of decisions. I will also use social media to promote resources and student services and post updates on senate happenings. I want to make sure that all students know their voices will be heard, so I will also be available via email for any questions or concerns. I want to maintain an open dialogue with constituents, so I promise to check both my social media for any direct messages and my email throughout the day and
respond to questions or concerns as soon as possible.","I am the best candidate for this position because I am passionate about social change and I have a strong work ethic and desire to see my goals come to fruition. I will dedicate myself to listening to the needs of our student body and carrying out solutions. I understand that in order to be an effective senator, I must be able to identify opportunities and issues from multiple perspectives and see how a single decision can impact groups of people differently. My ability to listen, see things from the perspective of others, develop solutions and implement a plan makes me the best candidate for this position, because these skills are necessary for being an effective senator in
A.S. I will actively listen to the concerns of all groups and campus organizations and do my best to operate in a way that brings cohesion to our student body and address student needs in a timely manner. Transparency and understanding issues from multiple sides is important to me because over the last few years we have all witnessed the chaos that we are inheriting. Our future America needs leaders who are willing to engage and participate, listen and understand opinions and perspectives different from their own.","Centrist - I think it is more important to look at the policies rather
than following a party line.",Good - I think the 72nd A.S. Senate did a good job addressing the needs of the student body given the circumstances. This is an unprecedented time and we should commend A.S. for their work throughout the pandemic. No one was prepared to handle a situation of this magnitude and they did their best to ensure that the needs of our student body were met while simultaneously navigating their own changing situations.,"I do not support the violation of human rights in any form in any part of the world, and perpetrators should be held accountable for their actions. I am presently neutral on this topic; however, I will continue to research the Palestine-Israel situation and consider the arguments made by those who support and oppose divestment.","No - I believe that UCSB should lower tuition rates and extend services to help those in most need of financial support, but we cannot completely cut out tuition. The university would not be able to serve our student body or provide us with on-campus resources, and we cannot overlook the T.As, professors and administrators within our departments. One of the platforms I am running on is to prevent tuition increases, and I will work with administration to come up with independent solutions to decrease the cost of attendance and reallocate funds so that we can provide more resources for students.","The mental health services provided at UCSB address a number of mental health concerns but these services lack the infrastructure necessary to help students of all backgrounds, and are often inaccessible to students because of wait time. With this in mind I have chosen to advocate for
more proactive mental health resources as one of the platforms I will be running on. I think CAPs should extend their assessment hours along with their virtual appointment hours so that students can have more time to access these resources and have greater flexibility in their schedules. Furthermore, I believe that increasing the staff will help alleviate the wait time for these essential services. We all understand that mental health and self-care are essential to physical and emotional health, and productivity in all areas of our lives. College alone can be a stressful environment and over the past year many students have experienced an increase in stress, anxiety or depression, and are in greater need of mental health services. I believe we should take the initiative and learn from this so that we can bolster the mental health services and resources at UCSB to ensure that no student is left without the tools they need.","I believe that the response to the partying in Isla Vista could have been handled differently by the university, Greek life, and the county if they had acted more swiftly to address these allegations. While it is difficult to enforce sanctions outside of the university, and even more so when most are working remotely, we need to hold UCSB students accountable for their failure to follow social distancing and county orders, especially since their actions can have devastating consequences. As students of a prestigious university, we must hold ourselves and our peers to a higher standard because we are in the position to understand the ramifications of our choices. All culpable individuals and organizations should be held responsible in accordance with any state or local laws that were violated. As members of society, it is our obligation to follow laws that are in place to protect the safety and wellbeing of ourselves and others. We cannot neglect our responsibility to our community and society at large by disregarding state and local health mandates. Each person is responsible for their own decisions and should understand the consequences of their actions and how their decisions to hold large gatherings which violate social distancing protocols impact those around them.","Yes. Title IX is effective in some instances, but does not address the real issues surrounding sexual assault because it does not actively work to end a culture of violence or provide the necessary support for survivors. I think that UCSB needs to increase accessibility to supportive programs for survivors by expanding the reach of their current programs, and work more closely with campus and Isla Vista police to create safe spaces for survivors. I will advocate for a more supportive dialogue on campus to destigmatize the perception associated with survivors and create a culture that does not perpetuate violence of any kind. Furthermore, we need to hold culpable individuals accountable for their crimes, and there needs to be a greater sense of urgency displayed by the university to punish perpetrators, so that this culture of sexual violence does not continue. I believe that the installation of more Blue light systems on and around
campus will help create an environment where students have a greater sense of security and safety when alone. I will work with administrators and campus police, EVPLA, along with outside organizations including Isla Vista police, and IVCSD to get these installed so that people can feel safer when walking through campus and the surrounding area.","UCSB has made significant progress historically in serving underrepresented groups, however there is still much more to be done. Understanding that there is room for growth and improvement, I made this topic a focus of one of my election platforms in my A PLUS Plan. One of my goals is to unify our school through open conversations that promote understanding and awareness. My primary strategy is to increase the frequency and reach of our message, that all underrepresented groups have a home here at UCSB and everyone one in every group should feel safe and supported. We need to increase awareness of the continued challenges that many groups face, and I will advocate for outreach programs that create an equitable environment for students of all backgrounds. Maintaining communication is critical, I will take the necessary time to meet with members of all groups to truly understand their struggles and ask for their input and ideas that they believe will help. I believe that in every segment of society no single person has all the answers and I pride myself on my ability to see things from the perspective of others. Everyone should be proud of who they are and should feel supported and acknowledged at our university.","The fist bill I plan to author while on the A.S. Senate will bolster the mental health resources offered through CAPs by extending their assessment hours, their virtual appointment hours, and increasing their staff. I am running on a platform of advocacy, promoting the increase of mental health resources for students because this is something that needs to be addressed. One thing we have learned over this past year is the importance of taking care of one’s mental health and how
we need to destigmatize the perception associated with asking for help. I believe our campus can improve upon their existing model and reach a larger and more diverse demographic of students. By carrying out this bill students will have more flexibility in their own schedules and be able to access these resources more frequently. Increasing the staff will decrease the wait time and increase the number of students that can be seen daily. These essential resources are extremely
impacted, and I hope to work with CAPs because I want to make sure that students can access these resources conveniently. I also hope to work with the UCSB Mental Health Taskforce so we can continue reaching out to students and providing them with information regarding what mental health resources are available.","As a senator I want to make sure that transparency in A.S. and keeping students informed are our top priorities. I will use social media to connect with our student body and emailing lists to reach out and keep everyone updated on current A.S. matters, progress, and the timelines of resolutions and bills. I believe that listening to the ideas and concerns of constituents is essential to effectively carrying out my responsibilities as an L&S Senator. As detailed in my sixth response, it is important to me that all students know that their opinions, ideas and concerns matter. I will hold bi-weekly zoom office hours and I will be available for appointments scheduled outside of these hours so that constituents can reach me multiple times throughout the week depending on availability in their own schedules. I will use my senator Instagram to post relevant information concerning senate affairs and to keep students informed of decisions. I will use social media to promote resources, student services, and engage with my constituents. I want
to make sure that all students know their voices will be heard, so I will also be available via email for any questions or concerns. I promise to check both my social media for any direct messages and my email and respond to questions or concerns as soon as possible.","The transition back to in-person instruction and in-person activity in Isla Vista will be somewhat challenging as we navigate the post COVID-19 world, and as a senator my number one goal is to
make sure that our student body feels supported throughout this entire transition. I will advocate for increased understanding and support of students from professors and administrators, so that students can transition back to in-person classes stress-free. I will work with on campus resource providers to reach out to students so they can take advantage of academic and career advising, so students feel secure in their goals and achieve academic success. With the difficulty and stress of transitioning, I want to emphasize how important it is for students to take care of their mental health and take time for self-care. I will work with CAPs and the UCSB Mental Health Taskforce to extend their resources and information to students, reaching out to all demographics and especially those most in need of these services. Depending on the situation and health advisory in Isla Vista, I will support the transition to in-person activity that follows state and
country health guidelines to ensure the safety of all students and community members.","The pandemic posed a great obstacle for the university, and while no one could have planned for something of this magnitude, I believe that UCSB did their best in handling the coronavirus pandemic and providing remote instruction. UCSB successfully provided virtual instruction and other traditionally on-campus resources to students during the pandemic. But it was still difficult for many students to access these resources online and receive the same level of support that would have been provided to them if we were on campus. Scheduling appointments with career counselors and academic advisors was difficult due to high demand and long wait times. I understand the difficulties faced by employees who were working remotely, and I think that if more people were hired in certain departments, such as academic advising, then UCSB could have more efficiently addressed the needs of students as we tried to navigate this virtual learning model. UCSB should have also decreased the cost of tuition because many families and
individuals were adversely affected by our changing situation. There needed to be a greater understanding at the university level of how this pandemic affected the student population, because many students encountered and continue to face economic hardship and financial uncertainty.",,,,,,,
Taylor Tait,holly,L&S Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162538/taylor-tait.jpg,,She/her/hers,2nd,,,,"This past year as an On-Campus Senator, I have grown to learn much about the inner workings
of Associated Students and its interactions with the student body and greater Isla Vista
community. I have collaborated with various Associated Students entities and, through these
experiences, have developed a passion for student advocacy. I have built upon my leadership
skills to reflect the needs and ideals of our community. In the seventy-second senate, I will
further this advocacy and action. My experience from this past year has furthered my ability to
create change at UCSB through authoring resolutions, meeting with faculty, and working
alongside student organizations. There is still so much I would like to accomplish in my time in

Associated Students, transitioning to be a Letters and Science Senator will aid in broadening my
efforts for students with a more dedicated effect on academia. As you’ll read below, I am
teeming with ideas and a vision for how I will create a better UCSB through the Associated
Students Senate.","I have been fortunate enough to be a part of a great variety of entities in my time at this
university. As a first year, I joined the Residence Hall Association, becoming the Activities Chair
for Manzanita Village. It was a great experience that helped me learn the ropes of on-campus
politics on a much smaller scale than A.S. Senate. While my term was cut short, I was fortunate
enough to learn the inner workings of Hall Council, and how to collaborate with my fellow
students, both in my hall and elsewhere. I’ve also involved myself in various student activist
groups, advocating for the banning of fracking in Santa Barbara and participating in many
COLA protests. Additionally, I played on the Women’s Club Water Polo team, furthering my
passion for the sport while meeting an incredible set of students who shared a unique balance of
academics and athletics. This year, I was elected to be my team’s Social Media Coordinator,
which has taught me much about the vitality of smaller UCSB groups in their ability to connect
students, both new and returning, to our campus. For this last year, I have been an On Campus
Senator in the Associated Students Senate. This experience is what most qualifies me, as I have
already taken the time to learn the fundamentals of Senate and how to use this privilege for the
betterment of our students and the greater good of those we value. I am more than familiar with
helping to facilitate discussions within Associated Students and how to collaborate with
organizations that span the greater Santa Barbara area. These experiences have armed me with
the eagerness to take on the responsibilities of a Letters and Science Senator.","This past year, I have authored and co-authored various resolutions in the name of our students’
well being. As we begin to reopen, I would like to increase funding for campus organizations
that work to combat food insecurity such as the A.S. Food Bank. I hope to help these
organizations grow so they have enough resources to support more of our student population and
eventually expand the variety and multitudes of other life essentials such as toiletries, medicines,
and first aid. My personal love and appreciation for the environment has led a decent size of my
Senator efforts towards that of environmental justice and advocacy. I plan to further this by
presenting my resolution to ban the use of toxic herbicides in university landscaping once more
to the Senate and work to instate compost bins around popular areas on campus. In regards to the
climate crisis, I would like to enact resolutions that will promote more environmental
sustainability on our campus. I would like to accomplish this by instating campus policies such
as reducing light pollution and energy waste in our campus buildings, re and refusing to support

businesses involved in fracking, unethical palm oil, and other industries that are detrimental to
our planet. Finally, as your next Letters and Science Senator, I will work tirelessly to see that our
transition from the hardships of virtual learning to the demands of a fully functional UCSB is
dealt with in care. Many students are inexperienced with the demands presented by in-person
classes, both on an academic and personal level. My intention is to hold departments accountable
when this fragile yet vital transition occurs.","As your next L&S Senator, I will strive to embody the ideals of all members of our Gaucho
community. I’ll take on this position with openness in discussing and advocating for the concerns
and hopes for our UCSB community, dedicated to bringing efficiency and transparency to our
Gaucho community. What our campus needs is someone who is dependable and will work for
our students’ best interests. I’ve spent the past seven years working in various leadership
positions, growing to encompass a variety of skills that would make me perfect for this position.
This past year I have worked in the Senate, representing the values of students, and uplifting
their voices through advocacy and authoring legislation. In general, my platform is geared
towards topics of environmentalism and academia. Firstly, I will continue to promote
environmental sustainability by increasing climate change awareness, minimizing the campus’
carbon footprint by bringing compost bins to campus, and other practices that will help UCSB
become a truly green campus. Additionally, I hope to remove unethical items from the dining
commons such as shark cuisines. I hope to address the reality of food insecurity in our
community by growing and expanding our AS food bank, making our farmer’s markets more
accessible, allowing guests to use students’ meal swipes instead of charging it to their BARC
account, and increasing the capacity of donating meal swipes. Advocating for improvement of
our student health processes through conversations with our school administration, especially
mental health, is another goal of mine. In regards to transparency, I plan to increase recognition
of all Clubs, Committees, organizations, and other groups on our campus. Every Gaucho, both
big and small, deserves to have their voice heard. As your next Letters and Science Senator, I
would like to reserve much of my efforts on helping to relieve the stress induced by the transition
to a fully functioning campus in light of the pandemic. Specifically, I hope to create more outside
study spots for students that are equipped with charging ports. On a larger scale, I will uplift
students within academic capacities, advocating for department leniency as the virtual school
setting transitions to in-person by collaborating directly with faculty executives. Much like this
year, I plan to work diligently with my fellow senators, administrators, and everyday students in
order to achieve my goals of being in office. I will showcase complete transparency in all my
senatorial endeavors, welcoming anyone to meet with me through appointments or office hours,
as well as regularly updating my social media. By doing so, I can demonstrate my commitment
to my intentions and allow myself to be held accountable by those who are well informed.","If there was enough time in this term, I would have loved to meet and interact with every
university and Isla Vista organization to see firsthand the work they’ve put into our community
and how I could advocate for their ideals. As a current senator, I have had this opportunity to
work alongside fellow Associated Students members such as the Environmental Affairs Board,
Finance and Business Committee, Community Affairs Board, and the Zero Waste Committee, to
name a few. These are a few organizations that I know of firsthand whose goals align with my
own campaign vision. Next year as a Letters and Science Senator, I would like to continue these
relations and even branch out towards more academic minded groups and to learn more about the
functions of groups that advocate for basic needs security.","Whether in person or remote, I plan to make myself available to all students and administrators. Iwill accomplish this through establishing flexible office hours and regularly updating my socialmedia. The Associated Students website is also a great resource to document my progress in thesenate as well as my availability as it varies quarter to quarter. I plan on doing everything I can tobe available and transparent to my constituents. Some of the ways I will do this are to holdweekly zoom office hours and be available for scheduling appointments, so that I have theopportunity to discuss concerns and ideas face to face with students. Additionally, I will beactive on my senate Facebook and Instagram, updating my page constantly with what happens inthe Senate and the actions I take to better our community.","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I am driven, compassionate, ameager to learn about and reflect the interests of our students, and most importantly I amexperienced in doing so. What our campus needs is someone who is dependable and will work infavor of all our students’ ideals, not someone who wishes to further their own hidden agendas.I’ve spent the past seven years working in various leadership positions, growing to encompass avariety of skills that would make me perfect for this position. Some organizations I’ve had theprivilege to work with include: Manzanita Hall Council (as an Activities Chair), WE Charity (asa School Liaison), and collaborating environmentally focused campus organizations such as theEnvironmental Affairs Board, and of course being an On Campus Senator this past year. Each ofthese positions has taught me what it means to be a leader and how to become a voice for thepeople. My work ethic would be best described as resilient, organized, and creative. I have a true
 passion for considering the perspectives and values of others and finding a way to incorporate
 them into the bigger picture. For all these reasons and more, I am well qualified and will thrive
 as your next Letters and Science Senator.",Left-leaning,"Very Good; the 71st Senate has moved mountains in advocating in the students’ interest.They accomplished so much in the past year, from lobbying to increase various BCU funds andutilizing a COVID-related aid task force to better support the financial insecurities in ourcommunity, to reaching beyond our campus to support students and indigenous negativelyaffected by the commercialization of conservation lands in the greater Santa Barbara area. What Iappreciate about the efforts of our previous senate is how dedicated they were when it came toimproving life beyond on-campus means. I want to build upon their work by collaborating withmore organizations to provide them more transparency and opportunities, especially in regards toacademic hardships during the transition back into in-person instruction.","Yes-This topic has been widely debated throughout the years at UCSB. My values align with the
intent to retract any and all unethical interactions, and to me this includes companies that profit
off inhumane treatment of workers. In all forms, I believe that UCSB would benefit from
exploring the idea of establishing relationships with companies that are confirmed to be ethically
sound.","No-It’s no argument that the tuition we students pay greatly supports the multitude of organizationsand resources that make our university as great as it is. Although I am not completely confidentof whether or not focusing the Senate’s time on abolishing tuition for UCSB is going to be
effective, I firmly believe in advocating for reducing our tuition prices. Furthering this,scholarships and other forms of financial aid should be extremely expanded so that they cancompensate for tuition and student fees. There needs to be more availability of scholarships sostudents who come from all backgrounds and classes can be supported. Financial hardshipsshould not prevent people from gaining access to education. In my time as a member of the 71stSenate, I have helped to advocate for the reallocation of student fees towards students withfinancial insecurities. I would like to continue this sediment as well as urge the university toreduce tution in compensation for the lack of resource access throughout the pandemic.","From CAPS to Health and Wellness, our campus is blessed to have multiple resources whereGauchos can reach out for support. I especially appreciate how easy it is to discover Healthand Wellness events as well as our school’s overall efforts to not only normalize maintainingmental health, but prioritizing it over social and even academic success. Overall, I believethat our mental health services are inadequate due to the large demand that has come tooverwhelm our services. Every aspect of mental services I have encountered has proven to beincredibly popular and therefore busy. Resources can be difficult to navigate. Schedulingtherapy appointments is a grueling task, especially considering the toll it takes on ourstudents’ already full schedules. Even the crowds of pet therapy dogs during dead week werepacked. What I propose is an increase in funding and support of mental health services andan exploration of possibly offering virtual therapy appointments. The foundation of ourcommunity is well being, and I stand for investing in every Gaucho’s mental health.","I completely believe that the response to greek life’s affect on the community’s health and safetywas more reactive than proactive. It was a shame to watch students and some of my own friendsbecome exposed due to negligence from their peers and, in addition, see the delayed responsefrom the university to enact policies to combat this spread. This pandemic has induced massivestress on our healthcare workers, both at Student Health Services and in the greater Santa
Barbara county. Their efforts and gradual accessibility to students are a reflection of their hardwork and sacrifice. The lack of incentive to not participate in large gatherings throughout thepandemic has added to their workload, and I feel that covid-spreading organizations should beheld accountable, not financially, but rather their status of activeness or through communityservice. It seems only natural that those who have contributed to the health hardships of IslaVista should serve the community through volunteer work in order to compensate for the damagethey have caused.","I believe that Title IX is a decent base for a system to address sexual assault. However, it’smerely a foundation for the complex and careful works that are needed to be put into place inorder to smooth out the many flaws of this legislation. Currently, Title IX does a mediocre job inaccepting the worth of sexual assault survivors. It also lacks an incentive for our justice systemto approach and address these reports with the same speed and effort as any other criminal case.Especially when Title IX is implicated in communities where sexual assault cases are notoriouslyhigh, I believe that UCs absolutely need further legislation if they hope to create saferenvironments. There is more that could be done to improve upon how UC campuses approachthese situations.","I don’t want to speak on behalf of these groups, but from what I have seen so far UCSBhas made waves in representing and supporting its communities that are oftenunderrepresented and mistreated. A variety of student unions, organizations, andspecialty housing are features that are unparalleled to some universities in our country.Coming to UCSB, one of the first things that I found captivating was the normalizationof introducing pronouns when meeting people. I believe that the little, everyday actionsof recognition and inclusion form a massive impact on our community. Promoting thismindset will only strengthen our Gaucho community. As someone who grew up in aSoCal inland suburb, I found it surprising how little recognition our beautifully diversegroups, clubs, and organizations received. In high school, showcasing and supportingthe BSU, Polynesian club, and disabled students was something I came to normalize;and with that came an appreciation and admiration for these underrepresentedcommunities. In light of my experiences, I urge for bringing the spotlight to varioushistorically underrepresented groups on campus and truly supporting all members of
 UCSB is absolutely vital. As a senator, I plan to support these well deserving groups
 and help them further their voices on our campus.","When I am elected as a Letters and Science Senator, I plan to author legislation that helps toaccommodate students as we transition into in person instruction. A large portion of the studentpopulation has yet to experience the fast pace of in person instruction, and this will beoverwhelming to some. I plan to hold departments accountable, meeting with administration todevise a plan that will ease this transition. My resolution will take the form of a positional guidein how to relieve students of the stressful inner workings of in person education. I plan to upliftstudents in the College of Letters & Science and other colleges within academic capacities,advocating for department leniency as the virtual school setting transitions to in-person bycollaborating directly with faculty executives.","As a senator, I would strive to make the everyday functions of A.S. more transparentby keeping our media even more up to date and opening up discussions of A.S.actions. As a senator this past year, it was an abrupt exposure learning about all theintricacies of Associated Students, and I came to realize that it’s difficult to grasp anadequate understanding of what A.S. does for our university if you don’t have anypersonal connections. It’s important to involve all Gauchos in campus politics so thatthey have a better understanding and appreciation of what makes our campus, and,eventually, learn how they can help shape and improve upon the efforts of those whocame before them. I hope to bring everyday routines of AS leaders through the meansof social media, email, and other various platforms.","As stated above, I intend to work diligently to aid the transition academically through meetingwith departments to devise a plan that fairly accommodates the difficulties that will be ensued asstudents relearn (and, for our first years and transfer population, learn) how to function in acompletely open and active campus. In Isla Vista, I have advocated for the normalization ofcoronavirus testing and have been transparent in my own journey throughout the pandemic andvaccination. I will help to ensure that the community of Isla Vista has adequate access tovaccinations and PPE. Specifically, I will push for policies that will benefit the health of our
 community. I am unsure of what the fall quarter will entail for our community COVID-wise, but
 there is no doubt that my time in the Senate will include advocating for public health and the
 protection of our community.","As an On-Campus Senator last year, I was appalled to watch as the university dismantled oncampus living and left Resident Assistants, the Residence Hall Association, and the on campusstudent population in the dark. While it was understandable that the university did notimmediately hold all the answers and plan of action during the course of the pandemic, I felt thatthe utter refusal of communication was grossly unacceptable. This, paired with the suggestion ofraising tuition to compensate for the lack of revenue caused by the pandemic has fueled my callto action in regards to representing the needs of our students. As I entailed previously, the workof Student Health Services has been a foundation for public health in Isla Vista. It has givenstudents access to regular testing and has since grown to vaccinate our staff and studentemployees. Compared to the difficulties of accessing testing and vaccines that other universitiesand cities have faced, I feel that UCSB has been rather successful in these notions. Academically,the university has been reluctant to accommodate students in the virtual setting. The efforts ofstudent organizations and the 71st Senate have strived to counteract this, creating and donatingfunds to the COVID Task Force, adapting extracurricular activities to an online format, andpushing for the pass/no pass exception many departments have opted in to. Next year as a Lettersand Science Senator, I will build upon these incredible features as the effects of the pandemicwill still likely loom over our university experience.",,,,,,,
Cassandra Chow,holly,Creative Studies Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162714/cassandra-chow.jpeg,,she/her/hers,3rd,Music Composition,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 73rd senate because I am willing to put in the time,efforts, and fervor for this position and am full of innovative ideas. At CCS, I will aim forbuilding a straightforward, creative environment where students feel at home. Through theposition of the College of Creative Studies senator, my aim is to create as accessible of a learningexperience as possible for UCSB students and make students feel at home as we readjust back tocampus life. Whether it be through advocating for student needs, introducing or expanding onevents on campus, or creating and building a strong community to welcome all students, new andold alike, I can be that person. I will focus on clear ways for our campus to continue functioning.I will seek to ensure safety and look out for the future of our school. I will be running not justfor fun, but for fulfilling the experience of serving and learning. I’m doing this because I see somuch potential and growth that can be done on campus, and with this position, would love to dowhatever I can for as many students as I can impact. UCSB has been my home for the last fewyears, and I would want to be a part of growth and changes this next year.","On campus, I have joined and participated in several clubs and their events throughout my time at UCSB, even during the pandemic. These clubs have amplified my sociability and sustained my outgoing nature. As for academics, my experience as a section leader in the UCSB chamber choir has helped me obtain hearty leadership experience working with UCSB students. Within this role, I had to optimize my time and organize rehearsals for the sopranos and make
sure every section of music was pristine. I especially take my experience as a section leader to heart because it showed me that I not only have the ability to generate change, but confirmed how much I love to spur on and encourage my classmates. This was not much different from my varsity swim team captain high school days. The support I had received helped me realize that my leadership potential has always been there, and can be continued to now, as I strive for the CCS senator position. I will always use my time serving to encourage others. It’s quite the story, as little did I know that this UCSB chamber choir section leader experience would be a foreshadowing of what was to come, as I would apply and accept for the Music Composition major that coming summer. My involvement as Music Composition major in the College of Creative Studies has been very intensive. As of now, I interact with the CCS environment as much as possible online, attending the CCS Coffee Hours, connecting with students across UCSB and internationally, and preparing myself physically and mentally for this endeavor."," These are just a few of several ideas I have, but I’m open to hearing more from students and
 faculty at UCSB
Resolution 1: Funding for technology and software needs for students
Some form of uniformity in what we use in class would help students and professors. I want ease for our students to be affording and accessing their own school devices, specifically any laptops, writing utensils, or music notation software.
Resolution 2: Advocating for lab credits
Labs would generally give minimal credit to their students for the amount of work the students do and hours they put in, so my goal is to opt for a more concrete way of assigning lab credits.
Resolution 3: Allocate funding for independent research projects
Several students want to complete independent research projects at our college, but don’t have the needed funds to do so. This would not come without direction, so I’ll organize and allocate funding by having my council be part of the several steps in deciding whether these projects should be funded.
Bill 1: Safety measures in the CCS building
On student safety, I will enforce masks will be worn at all times while inside the building. Depending on the state of the success of vaccinations, this can change.","My platform is about engaging, connecting, advocating with and for students, introducing propelling ideas, and overall creating community. My platform will also be introducing the fabulous CCS Student Council, which I am excited to chair. Specifically, my team and I will be organizing gatherings and events for student engagement and interactment, whether it be through Zoom, Discord, or small in-person events. As a Music Composition major, I will opt for concerts and performances to engage students. I’ll personally be connecting with students through my office hours, meeting with students, and expanding study spaces on campus. I’ll be working towards advocating for UCSB students and their educational needs. I will look into the process of lab class crediting as well as more funding for independent research projects for students. I’ll be coming up with introspective ideas and introducing new prospects and plans, from designing workshops and organizing exhibits displaying student works, to advertising shows for the UCSB community. Overall, I want the creation of the CCS community to be encouraged, I will be in attendance at Coffee Hour, and be utilizing and making sure CCS facilities are set to the best and most accessible degree for students to learn together in a comfortable and engaging environment.","I hope to work with UCSB campus organizations and entities involving programming, funding, and activities. I will try to ENGAGE with students by organizing student events, concerts, and workshops with Event Planning, Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC), IV Arts, and the Program Board. Specifically with these, with the aid of CCS Student council, I’ll do my best to be in communication with whoever is in charge. I will CONNECT with students through my own office hours and discussing paths for student success with themed, planned office hours! Will CREATE COMMUNITY by attending CCS events and running the CCS Student Council. Will do my best to ADVOCATE for UCSB students and their educational needs, connecting with the Finance and Business Committee as well as offices of our Student Advocate and Internal Vice President to look into the process of lab class crediting as well as funding independent research projects for students. Lastly, I will also seamlessly INTRODUCE plans and more events and workshops for students with the CCS Student Council hopefully with
the help of the Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB), Creative Media Unit, and working in KCSB. Overall, these organizations and entities would not only enrich and encourage students, but equip me as CCS Senator.","I certainly hope that we are in person by this time, but if remote instruction continues in the 2021-2022 year, I will make myself available by hosting office hours and holding events for students online and maybe socially distanced events if we’re in IV. I want everything to be as safe as possible and hopefully the vaccines will be out and we can converse again. Being remote, the best route of action is doing what we can with what we have. It sounds like Zoom will be my best friend. I will utilize Zoom and become a pro at handling all the quirks of the system. I will be making myself available by being there for students across social media. I’ll be active on my Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram so students can reach me. I’ll be as present as possible and consistent. I am still deciding on this, but I could possibly post stories for more conversations to be held with students online, and post interactively so questions can be asked and answered easily. While I will make myself available as much as possible, I do think that there is value in being offline. There is a time to be unplugged, and a time to be plugged in. I’ll be working towards a healthy balance and organizing my emails and office hours accordingly.","I will be going into my last year at UCSB and am willing and ready for this position. Myrole as CCS senator is not going to be without its challenges. Challenges can come onheadstrong, but I won’t let them overtake me. My goal is to understand how to handle them anddefeat them one by one. When I work, I take my time, I plan ahead, and I live with intention. Icannot guarantee I will know every answer to every problem, nor do I believe there is such athing as the “best candidate,” as everyone is strong in their own way. I even know this task isgoing to be time-consuming, but because of my steady work-ethic and flexibility, knowing howto tackle and put down issues, and the overall drive and passion for UCSB, counting on mywillingness to protect, advocate, and being an arm to lean on won’t be hard. I love my CCSmajor and the way that CCS is set up at UCSB, and am prepared to lead by example while beingas straightforward as possible. I aim for excellence and clarity in my position work, and this isseen even in the music that I compose for my major. This position may only be temporary, but
 the impact I create will remain. I don’t know what the future holds, but I will take CCS to the
 next level in my last year at UCSB.","Other: N/A I tend to keep my political leanings separate from academics
and my campaign.","Very Good- Our student needs were met dutifully this last year, especially with the pandemic season occurring. While we were in session last year, for example, the AS Food Bank was awesome for an extra snack. I have felt comfortable in the atmosphere of the study spaces, and community around me. I write “very good” only because there needs to be a way office hours can be more visible for students. I think the opportunity to be a part of the A.S. Senate and knowing that involvement with student government is a possibility can be brought to light even more.","Yes-Yes, I think the best option is to create a plan of action and divest if possible. If we are the only ASUC that has not done this it is a flag that we should not stay out as we have and formally pass a resolution. We should get this resolved as soon as we can. I would be in favor of A.S. UCSB divesting in alignment with this movement."," No- I don’t believe UCSB should be tuition-free. For the level of education we are learning from, it does not come without expense. Our professors and TA’s and faculty work so hard and our school needs the money to keep our campus up and running and the several buildings, resources and tutors that amplify student learning.","Yes, it’s adequate at the moment, but there is always room for improvement. Results can vary for students. As mental health is a grey area, it can be unstable, difficult, and hard to keep track of. To combat this, health care professionals need to be hired and present in general for their patients and follow up. Following up with the patient is so important as well. Without a clear follow up and plan of action it can be detrimental for the student’s health. Furthermore,
every worker should be certified at Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS). UCSB needs to be hiring always a certified care professional giving help, and not just anyone. Our students deserve the best and their mental health state is not something to take lightly. CAPS needs to be as accessible as possible, and scheduling an appointment should be simple, from making it online to a phone call. Students who have experienced help from CAPS I’ve seen recommend it to other students, but actually going out and making an appointment is a big step. What can be done is easier access to the website. Access to the website should be regularly emailed out, students are paying for this and need to take advantage of this helpful resource. Appointment scheduling needs to be more bolded and details of this can also be emailed out as well regularly.","Yes, the university and Greek life could have handled the situation differently. When students took matters into their own hands and there was a lack of respect for mask wearing, and bringing people into Isla Vista, it only got worse. The university did not respond and gave no opinion. The IV police did what they could but it was still rampant. There were many parties that were held by Greek life to the extent it was almost embarrassing - apparently “covid parties” were a thing. But just the lack of care surrounding the University to actually do something about the pandemic did not occur. Words were spoken, little action could be done out of fear of the virus. It was difficult to hear that protecting the safety of faculty even got out of hand, as it spread to some dining hall workers at UCSB. Pandemic could have been lessened at UCSB in Isla Vista if travel was limited, masks were taken seriously, and people actually quarantined. As for some punishment, if they are found, I would not be surprised the responsible people face fines of $500 and above. It is not okay to be disruptive. Just because something is there, does not mean it is right. Just because it seems like fun, fun doesn’t equate to safety. Actions like this can’t be condoned, there has to be a consequence for every person involved. Greek life could potentially get lawsuited too for actively condoning events with some attendees spreading Covid. Not sure what is going to happen, but what’s done is done. All we can do is face the trauma head on, get vaccinated, and do our part by socially distancing and wearing a mask. Though the result
of the pandemic and people catching Covid could have been helped in a variety of ways, the damage has been done, and things are starting to look up.","Yes, I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its functions. The university can support sexual assault survivors by positing awareness and reminding students of personal safety and the importance of not being alone or putting oneself in a vulnerable position. The university can promote musical concerts, exhibits, or shows that can raise money that could potentially go to events to educate students on sexual assault and also to student medical health to fund these survivors anonymously. It would be to a worthy cause. As a Music Composition major, I’ll be able to advocate for these survivors by raising efforts through the support from the events, through song if given the chance. I firmly stand with the survivors of sexual assault and support their complaints and grievances. This is absolutely terrible to even think it happens at our university. Sexual assault is not something to ignore, and it is good to see this is being addressed now so that awareness that this happens and is not right and problems that women and men face are brought to light. UCSB has done a great job of having Community Safety Officers (CSOs) on call to walk or bike people home if needed. To prevent sexual assault, UCSB can implement even more safety measures with perhaps providing pepper spray for women to have on hand.","Not enough! Especially with Covid and the way everyone is dispersed at the moment, it’s not easy to discuss or have conversations like this. There is so much that is not taken into consideration when discussing these communities. The disregard for underrepresented groups is incredibly harsh. Though this question poses that the university could be “effectively serving” these groups, there are ways it has and has not. The way which has somewhat been effective is the university’s utilization of their Multicultural Center (MCC) and having speakers, as well as offering majors specifically for the study of underrepresented cultures, however having these
resources and majors only educate and spread awareness, and wouldn’t be effective in stopping any hate or the racism unless the students take a stand. Bias has been engrained to the point it leaves those who judge senseless to understanding. As for the “serving” part, the university does have spaces in the Student Resource Building (SRB), such as rooms for underrepresented groups. However, the fact that it’s there just draws even more attention to the inconsideration. Why is it only POC (people of color) get the attention drawn onto them? The goal may be to help, but since most students don’t know about it nor have the time to attend, it’s not fulfilling as it could be. These spaces may not be fully serving their needs and instead drawing unwanted attention onto them which could be unneeded, so I don’t see how it is too helpful but I see the good intentions. Nevertheless, I definitely don’t feel “served” here as as Asian-American woman nor do I truly desire to be. I choose to live knowing that my purpose is in something greater than this. As I’ve said before, the trials that are faced are only temporary.","I’m all for making things more accessible and easier for students, and technology plays too large of a role in my studies to let this pass. The first resolution I plan to offer is that I want some funding for technology and software needs for students and professors at our college. It would also be nice to see some form of uniformity in what we use in class so that it would be more flawless for the teaching of the professor and understanding of the students. I understand devices vary and people have their preferences, but at least at CCS, I would like there to be some money granted for students to purchase their necessary devices for school. The lack of access to a good computer, or laptop should not be the cause of delay, worry, or stress. For the music composition department at CCS, my focus will be on Digital Audio Workstations, and music notation software. Sometimes it is hard for students to even have access to the expensive software, and with our growing Music Composition major, which requires specific music softwares that several classmates are struggling to acquire, I will push for university funding for our composition needs for this expensive music software.","As your CCS senator, I’ll do my best to involve the student body through communication, fun events, social media, but also by fostering a mindset of growth, community and learning! Every student should know what is going on, and I’ll do my best to stay informed so I can keep everyone in the loop.
Here’s some steps I’ll take:
1. I’ll be communicative. I’ll be an open ear to friends, peers, classmates, etc. I’ll do what I can to inform students of what we’re doing by talking to them, engaging in conversations.
2. I’ll be a listener. I’ll be the one to take a step back and hear out what students need and want to discuss.
3. I’ll be a host. I’ll have the CCS Student Council host regular events for students at CCS and work with L&S senators for some fun mixer events.
4. I’ll use social media and be on my email and Discord regularly. Social media is pretty fun and I can see how a lot of people like it and I also will be an open source to those who don’t use it.
5. I’ll be active in my CCS community and around UCSB. Catch me at Coffee Hour, around campus, perhaps at some student clubs, or even playing some piano.","In my role as a CCS senator, I’ll help by informing those around me about what to expect as we transition back. I’ll be informative, clear and to the point. I’ll be flexible and up for any challenge that comes my way with the move. I would only send emails when necessary. I’ll overall be sending emails to classmates and CCS students, be active in the CCS Discord, and attend meetings for A.S. as well. CCS Student Council is going to be super fun and planning events, so I’ll be preparing and garnering classmates who would be interested. I would love to see excitement levels for the CCS Student Council going up, so I would be telling students about that for sure, which should warm them up. I would help the transition back to in-person instruction by being an example of someone who regularly attends class and by encouraging participation around me. I also want to be checking in on students not just in CCS, but reach out to L&S classmates as well. I’ll help those who need help, and though I’ll be vaccinated by then I would also be wary of the possible Covid. As for in-person activity in Isla Vista, I’ll be socially distant and masked when necessary, take bike rides, and engage my community there.","I believe the university did the right thing in giving the students the choice to move back or stay, and closing down campus was also a smart move. However, not handling the party situation, by the lack of enforcing stricter policies, or suspending those who participated, did not correct the problem but only alleviated it. Partying during the pandemic happened, and was glorified way more than it should have been. It was addressed, emails were sent, but not enough restrictive actions were taken to fully dissolve the parties. The coronavirus pandemic is being handled now, better than before. Students are getting vaccinated and our school is offering Covid tests. Unfortunately, remote instruction was not taken too seriously by most UCSB students. Some students lacked basic zoom etiquette, such as camera off, or not focusing on class, which was not addressed by our university nor brought to light since there was no policy. It was too relaxed. So many classes are asynchronous when it’s extremely difficult to be taught in that fashion. Furthermore, I’d hear about students not talking in breakout rooms, or for example, in my summer school class, no one in a class of 120 turning their cameras on. There are more examples I can state of course, but I overall believe that our university could have handled both situations differently to prevent spread of the coronavirus and make remote learning easier.",,,,,,,
Zachary Brenner,holly,Transfer Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17182406/zachary-brenner-Cropped.jpg,,He/Him/His,3rd,Political Science,,,"Immediately after my enrollment at UC Santa Barbara, I sought out clubs and other activities to
join to make friends and help prepare for my future. However, during this search, I found out
how unrepresented transfer students are in the various organizations and other student-orientated
programs that would greatly benefit transfer students. Groups for social involvement of students
do not thoroughly endorse the involvement of transfer students, and one of the biggest offenders
of this is Associated Students. Most of those who run for A.S. are handpicked by those who are
in the same social circles with each other, not for their qualifications. Gratefully, I happened to
luckily fall into this position of being afforded the opportunity to run with my party, but
ordinarily, most do not get as lucky as I have. Many in the A.S. senate and those running for
various positions, do not represent you. They belong to an exclusive club that looks to help their
friends, not you. And among us, the transfer students, this is extremely exacerbated by the lack
of resources that involve transfer students. That is why I am running for Transfer Student
Senator. There needs to be change from the inside to help transfer students that are getting the
short end of the stick from their fellow students, as well as ensure proper representation of all
students. Associated Students holds the power to help alleviate these inequalities. By being
elected to A.S. senate, we will be able to restructure how we are represented and get more
resources that we deserve as transfer students.","Being a transfer student, I have not had the time yet to be able to include myself in organizationson campus or in Isla Vista, but like most transfer students, I work. I have worked since I was 15years old. My background represents transfer students in a way that those who did not transferdoes not. My experience is diverse and typical of transfer students in the most unique and bestway. I have worked at a warehouse for a Christmas store, been in retail, and most recently, taughtHebrew to first graders at my synagogue, as well as currently being a congressional intern forCongressman Scott Peters. While I do not have the traditional involvement of those running forother A.S. Senate positions, my involvement lines up much closer to transfer students. Wetransfer students have been on a continual journey that does not always include campusactivities. We live in the real world, and live complex lives that we balance with our academics.
Much like other transfer students, I have real work experience in many different areas. That inconjunction with my work in a real representative, legislative-making apparatus, I will use thetools that many transfer students have in representing you. Real experience for real help
.","During my stay at UC Santa Barbara, I have seen a multitude of issues that Associated Studentscan address and solve. Still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an unparalleledcrisis of mental health and financial issues among transfer students. Transferring to UC SantaBarbara is already a stressful and unequal process, but the COVID-19 pandemic has onlymagnified this disparity. We must pass a bill that allocates more resources for services thatactually provide for transfer students. It is disastrous that A.S. has not acted more on thisgrowing inequality. We must act now to help our fellow transfer students. Another bill I wouldlike to introduce regards safety in Isla Vista. No student should feel unsafe to walk home at nightor to even be in their own house alone. I have heard countless stories of horrific incidents in IslaVista that should not have happened. By working closely with the Community ServiceOrganization and the IV Foot Patrol, we will pass a bill to provide as many resources as possibleto these organizations to prioritize safety. An important bill that needs to be introduced targetsthe egregious act of sexual assault, which has been running ravenously in our community. It is ofepidemic proportions that cannot continue. Last year, the A.S. Senate passed a resolution to standin solidarity with survivors of sexual assault. While it was in good faith, we need more swiftactions to curb this depravity. Under the guidance of CAPS and the UCSB chapter of CARE, theAdvocacy Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Misconduct, there needs to be a billto help stop sexual assault by increasing accountability. In the past, certain organizations havebeen basically excused for it with effectively no punishment. We cannot allow this to continue.No person should be subjected to this, and that is why we must act now.","Using my experience from past and current positions, my platform is to create a more cohesive,caring, and safe environment at UC Santa Barbara. I want to expand resources for transferstudents, increase safety in Isla Vista, and produce a more accessible A.S. for transfer students.We will create new initiatives and revamp old programs that integrate transfer students moreseamlessly into UCSB. By working closely with the Community Service Organization and theIV Foot Patrol, we will allocate as many resources as possible to make safety a prime concern inIsla Vista. Transparency, accountability, and accessibility in A.S. for all students, and inparticular for transfer students, will be increased. We will develop new solutions for housing fortransfer students facing financial hardships or a lacking connections to discover housing. Andultimately, begin to foster connections between transfer students and students who have been at
UC Santa Barbara since freshman year, so as to help develop a more compassionate Isla Vista forall the students of the future. As Transfer Senator, we would create a UCSB that puts the students
first.","There are countless amazing organizations I would love to work with. All of the changes tobetter UCSB rely on the guidance of the various organizations on and off campus. Fromorganizations that advocate for underrepresented peoples to academic resources, each of theseorganizations will help me to expertly craft bills to be as effective as possible. Nevertheless, atthe time being, we have urgent issues at hand that I would hope to work with certainorganizations to help tackle them immediately. One of these sets of organizations that I plan towork with are the various transfer student-run organizations, which due to their engagement withtransfer student related issues for a long time can provide fundamental details to how we can bestapproach every issue facing transfer students. The UCSB Transfer Student Center has been afocal point of many interactions of transfer students. With the Transfer Student Center, we canwork together to discover how we can help and what issues among transfer students are notaddressed enough. Another organization I would need to work with is the Transfer StudentAlliance. With the Transfer Student Alliance we can implement programs and pass bills that helptransfer students in all aspects of their UC Santa Barbara experience.","First, and foremost, my email is always open: zbrenner.ucsb.edu. Being available to my
constituents is extremely important to me. As Transfer Student Senator, I would represent my
constituents in a way that I act as a voice for them. Knowing all the issues involving UCSB and
its transfer students is not something I will promise to know, but being a part of representing my
fellow students will be listening to all the problems facing us from my fellow students. You, the
students, are my priority. I will always make myself available for ideas, concerns, or even a
picture of your dog! As senators, we are elected to do a job of staying informed and connecting
with our constituents constantly. And what we have seen with many of those who get elected to
A.S. is that they end up checking out after they get elected. I come prepared with years of
experience of commitment and work ethic to get our job done. I plan to host a “town hall” of
sorts once a week to address any questions, concerns, or ideas. We will conduct these meetings
over Zoom until further notice to allow for as many people to attend as possible. The link to
these meetings, as well as other virtual events I will have, will be widely available for every
student. However, I will be pushing as hard as possible to start having physical meetings as
 students begin to get vaccinated and health guidelines allow for physically meeting up. Also,
direct messaging on social media is always a great way to get in touch with me as well!","It feels almost strange saying the word “candidate” when talking about running for A.S. Senate.How this is all organized and covered is political theater. It is posturing from various people justtrying to get elected for the sake of themselves. While there are amazing people runningalongside me, a majority of those running are not well-equipped to best represent us. They lookat this as just an opportunity for them. For me, running to be a part of A.S. should not be aboutpolitical grandstanding, but about helping the student body. In this light, I do not really viewmyself as a candidate. I look at what I am running for as voice for transfer students. It is yourrepresentation in fighting for what is right, as well as what is needed to help transfer studentsnow, and for the future. A.S. Senate can help the average student so much more than we canimagine, and I have real experience to effectively address every concern we have as yourrepresentative. I am running for us. This is our opportunity for us. As your Transfer StudentSenator, you will always be represented first, and that is why I believe I am the best voice for us,the transfer students.","Other - Independent. All that is important for me is to identify solutions that work, and not blindly
 follow along the lines of partisan division.","Good- The 72nd A.S. Senate had very good intentions, but their intentions have not been
effective in delivering what is needed for the student body. This past year has seen an
unprecedented wave of terrible events that have affected students gravely, and those elected to A.S. have not responded well enough.","No- No, because it is a conflict halfway around the world. It is a discussion that is not conducive tosolving issues at UC Santa Barbara. Like many others, I hold personal views on this issue, but itdoes not help us address the major problems we have right now in Isla Vista and with our fellowstudents.","No- but tuition should be more affordable. Not everyone goes to college or even needs to attend
college. There are a variety of career paths that people take that do not include any college at all,
so forcing this burden on taxpayers is not the right solution. However, there is extreme bloat in
the administration at universities. In a study conducted by Delta Cost Project, it was found that
four-year institutions spent more on administration than they did on instruction. This
unreasonable bloat needs to be addressed, but not at the expense of those not in college.","Countless students at UCSB face an inordinate amount of stress, but those who face an unequalamount are transfer students. Trying to juggle the many things in our very busy lives is mentally
taxing, and a lot of times we require avenues to help our mental health. The faculty and staff atall UCSB mental health services do an amazing job in trying to stick to their mission of being aresource for mental support for students, especially during these trying times where manystudents are being directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its innumerable effects.They offer a service that is needed for students of all walks of life, as well as give students theopportunity to explore remedies for their own mental health. However, I do not think that mentalhealth services adequately take on the needs of students. There is a major problem ofaccessibility to the mental health services, particularly for transfer students. The services existand they are fantastic, but there is barely any outreach to students: many of whom need thesemental health services. Through a new assortment of various education initiatives, we can helpnotify all students of the mental services that are available for them. By doing this now, we canensure for the future a healthier and happier student body that knows that UCSB is there for
them.","Students who partied knowingly put people at risk, and, consequently, are responsible for the
major outbreaks in Isla Vista. They should feel ashamed and horrible about what they did.
However, I believe that the response to the partying by fraternities and sororities in Isla Vista
have been about as good as one can do without becoming too authoritative. The county has done
the best job they can with what resources are available. There are only so many people who work
for the county that can monitor activity. This is also the case with the university. The university
should not be responsible for these types of activities outside the university, and if it were
policing such activities, there are not enough resources. The major criticism I have is of our
community as a whole. There should have been more healthy social pressures in place to restrain
partying, as well as better communication in the community about the effects of what partying
and large social gatherings could cause. And now, there also needs to be planning for how to
guide students as the COVID-19 pandemic begins to wane. Widely available and accessible
answers to questions surrounding this new stage we are entering need to be distributed.
Questions such as: “How many people is too many?”, “Is only one dose of the vaccine okay to
see people?”, “What activities are safe to do?”, etc.","At the time of its passage in 1972, Title IX was a great start to help victims of sexism and sexualviolence on college campuses. Since then, it has been a relatively successful tool to investigatesexual assault allegations in the community, but has many issues. One of these major issues is itsprocess that fails to attack the cultures and practices where sexual assault runs rampant onuniversitiy campuses. It punishes the individual, but rarely targets the systems that perpetuatesexual assault. Here at UCSB, the Title IX Office ensures that every case is reviewed, and whenthere is sufficient evidence, potential charges are swiftly given. But this process usually onlypunishes the individual. There are anecdotal cases of organizations receiving charges, but it doesnot happen enough. A structural change is needed. Universities should be forced to put policiesin place that are in line with the legal repercussions of sexual harrassment or sexual assault thattake down organizations that regularly preserve this evil. Title IX is not harsh enough. Survivorsneed help as soon as this happens, and the individuals as well as the institutions that perpetuate itneed to be punished. Even with Title IX, one in four or five women in college will stillexperience sexual assault. This is horrific, and it cannot exist. Title IX needs to be strengthened.","One of the many reasons I love UCSB is the diversity of backgrounds of the many students.Talking to any random UCSB student they could be an international student from Seoul or grewup on a farm an hour outside of Mexico City. UC Santa Barbara prides itself on its diversity.However, as I am not a member of these groups, I do not want to speak for or on behalf of theircommunities. From what I know, UC Santa Barbara does a good job to set up resources for theBlack, Latinx, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities, but that is from my perspective. As yourTransfer Student Senator, I want to hear where our university lacks representation for thesegroups. Each of these groups deserves to let their concerns be addressed. One area thatAssociated Students does a phenomenal job is advocating for marginalized peoples. Throughtireless commitment, they have represented and improved the status of minority and LGBTQ+students. If elected, I would help continue this, and then some. We are strong in diversity.","Safety will be my number one priority. Many know that Isla Vista is full of petty crime and avariety of other safety concerns. We need more people on the ground every night to patrol the
streets of Isla Vista to create a safer environment for us. No student should feel unsafe to walkhome at night or to even be in their own house alone. I have heard countless stories of peoples’experiences of serial harrassers at nights, thieves, and people trying to break into their houses.This cannot continue. These shameful incidents in Isla Vista should have never happened, butgoing forward we can stop them. By working closely with the Community Service Organizationand the IV Foot Patrol, we will pass a bill to provide as many resources as possible to theseorganizations to prioritize safety. There should be no issue or excuse with not finding resourcesfor safety. By passing this bill, we can make everyone feel safer and comfortable, and ensure thesafety of the students of tomorrow. This can also be a model for other universities to follow. Itcan spawn a ripple effect that promotes safety for students in other universities.","Associated Students is somewhat out of touch and inaccessible to the average student. One of mypromises to my constituents is to advocate for transparency, accountability, and accessibility ofA.S. for all students, and in particular for transfer students. While campaigning, those runningfor A.S. tend to interact with the community, but once elected, this connection fades awayquickly. I want to change that by not only being more available personally to my constituents,but also communicating with grassroot groups and think tanks as the congressional office that Iwork for does. Many students in these organizations have the necessary skills to identifyproblems to be able to introduce efficient solutions that would be practical and effective.Specialized organizations ranging from solving housing issues to ending racial inequality arehere on campus. We need to involve our fellow students who know more on topics than we do.Not only is our student body directly affected by what A.S. does, but they are also our greatestresource we have. By involving more of our students, we can solve the many issues of UCSBwith more expertise.","We need to ensure that in-person instruction and in-person activity is safely, but aggressively
pursued. There have to be acts to begin to return us to a more normal time. This type of living,
and especially education, is not sustainable and not worth the high prices we pay to attend UC
Santa Barbara. As health guidelines and widespread vaccine availability rolls out, there is no
excuse to begin steps to return to something resembling normal. If COVID-19 restrictions still
stand by fall quarter, outdoor classes and activities should be offered. Currently, restaurants are
allowed for dine-in, but education in-person is not permitted. There is no reason that by the fall
quarter we cannot start to see a phasing in of programs that bring students back to Isla Vista and
to in-person instruction. Safely, we have to return to how we are supposed to live and be
educated. Swiftly and thoughtfully, there needs to be a plan for fall quarter to manage in-person
activities and instruction at our beautiful campus. Let’s safely return to something more normal.","It is extremely easy to retroactively look back at how UC Santa Barbara succeeded and failed athandling the COVID-19 pandemic and remote instruction, but what the university was facingwas something unprecedented and of huge magnitude. To mobilize a mass of resources inresponse was a monumental task, and compared to other universities, UCSB did much better.However, there are standing issues that the university can address now with almost a year ofCOVID-19. One area where the university failed is that tuition should have been reduced. Ouronline classes are not worth the cost. We pay for the experience of being at UCSB with ourprofessors. The level of scholarship and academia have been severely diminished, because thequality of education has dropped. Also, many professors are using asynchronous lectures andpassing the bulk of their work to TAs, as well not providing better resources for students to thrivein this new online environment. Right now, a year after the pandemic started, our quality ofeducation has dropped and we still do not have adequate methods to prosper academically. Goingforward, we need to hold the university more accountable for accommodating our students.",,,,,,,

Covid-19 outbreak. Many anti-foreigner activities around the country make the voice of
international students weaker than before. These phenomena make many international students
feel helpless and difficult. Many international students on campus also find themselves in trouble
because of language and cultural differences and cannot seek help. I found that some
organizations and services for students did not solve the problems of international students very
well, such as CLAS and CAPS services. They brought a lot of convenience and assistance to
students, but did not include international students. Because of language and communication
problems, these services have little effect for some international students. Over time, many
academic and mental problems have accumulated. For international students, they rarely take the
initiative to pay attention to and participate in these activities, feeling that they are an isolated
group.
I understand that this position was created to better help international students integrate
into the campus and solve problems about international students. Therefore, I chose to participate
in the election, to speak for international students, support international students, mobilize
international students to actively participate in school activities, and allow international students
to have a better learning and living experience in school.","Because of the Covid-19 outbreak, although I have not been to school life, I have heard
from many friends about school life and how they suffer during the epidemic, such as the reverse
day and night schedules of international students. These international students go to class every
morning, and their schedules are chaotic. They are studying very hard, but it is much harder than
usual. Such online learning is not only inefficient, but also very harmful to the body. For these
international students, I am very empathetic.

During this period, I also learned a lot about how AS works and the challenges faced by
international freshmen. Because all offline work has been transferred to online, it has become
very difficult for international freshmen to enroll. Many students do not know what needs to be
completed, the basic process of the school class and so on. It takes a long time to get used to
everything. Following these classmates, I also succeeded in becoming a classmate who cares
about the school and the students. As a Gaucho, although I am at home every day, I can
understand what happens in school and between students. I am looking forward to my next life
on campus.","In order for international students to have a better life and learning experience in school,
asking for more language options for CLAS and CAPS service is essential. These two services
are very important for every UCSB student. Many international students may choose to give up
these two services because of language and communication problems. They do not have a good
place to share their worries and seek academic help, which will make the campus experience for
international students very poor.
Second, promote emergency measures and safety guarantees on campus in different
languages to ensure that international students can find a place to seek help. Basic personal
safety is what every student should know most when entering the school. Enhancing
international students' awareness of campus safety is a prerequisite for integrating them into the
campus.
Third, create a forum for international students to share their worries and difficulties, and
involve related organizations to help these international students. I think that communication is
the best way to find problems. Only after we understand the needs of international students
through communication can we Help international students solve problems.
Fourth, improve the health problems of online classes for international students. Because
of the time difference, many international students are now living a life turned upside down.
Such online classes not only affect academic performance, but also harm the body.","In order to allow international students to better integrate into the campus and solve their
worries, I decided to create a forum for international students to share their difficulties and
worries and seek help. Posts can be published anonymously, which can better protect the privacy
of speakers. I will invite members of some specific organizations to stay at the forum to answer
questions from international students, introduce the activities of the school and the organization,
so that international students can become active on campus.
For many international students, fear of communication is the first step in preventing
them from speaking out. The establishment of the forum allows them to find a comfortable place

to communicate. Through in-depth communication with these international students, they can
intuitively understand their difficulties and help them solve their problems.
In addition, in order to better guarantee the safety of international students in the school,
the manuals on emergency measures and safety guarantees on campus have been translated into
multiple languages, and more contact with CLAS and CAPS service to create a multilingual
system. This is a huge project, but we can summarize the key points into articles for publication.
I believe this approach will be very effective in the initial publicity.","As mentioned earlier, the creation of a forum requires specific members of the
organization to solve specific problems. For example, I want to cooperate with the LGBTQ
organization of UCSB to support LGBTQ international students. Provide a communication
platform for LGBTQ international students. The same method applies to special education and
international survivors. Make sure international students’ voices are heard, give them a
comfortable place to share stories, and raise awareness, and let them know where to ask for help.
This can better solve the different problems of international students and make them feel Sense
of belonging.
In order to better publicize and allow more international students to participate in the
activities, I hope to cooperate with UCSB International Office (oiss) and international cultural
clubs in some schools. Because the news channels of international students may be limited due to
Covid-19, I hope to cooperate with these organizations that have close relations with
international students to better help international students integrate into the campus. The purpose
of this is to enable international students to participate in campus activities in the way they are
most used to. They will no longer feel like a separate group from the oiss and cultural clubs.","If the 2021-2022 school year is still a remote instruction, the creation of the forum is very
important. Because all work has been transferred online, it will be more convenient for
international students to use the forum. Some international students who dare not communicate
face-to-face with people can also choose to chat online. In general, remote instruction will not
greatly affect the development of my work.
In addition, some offline activities can only be transformed into a zoom form and carried
out by students. Interview and speech activities can be carried out directly through zoom to
ensure the health and safety of every student. And some offline collective activities can only be

forced to complete through zoom. All in all, remote instruction requires a lot of zoom, and
basically all activities are inseparable from zoom.
Compared with publicity, social media is particularly important without the publicity of persons
on campus. If the 2021-2022 school year is still remote instruction, social media usage will be as
huge as zoom.","As an international student, daring to express your own opinions to the public is the first
step to affirm yourself. I am very good at communicating with people and expressing my
opinions. I can always observe subtle problems and solve them. Details are everything, and
careful observation is an indispensable skill in communication. In high school, I have been
adapting to the status of an international student. As an international student who has fully
adapted to the new environment, I am well aware of the problems and problems of every
international student at this stage.
I dare to challenge myself. As the first international senator, there are still many problems
to face. How to start a new job and how to proceed perfectly is a test for every senator. My skills
are perfectly matched to the job requirements. In-depth communication can not only find
problems but also solve them well. How to integrate international students into the campus is a
problem that has always plagued everyone. I have strong learning and listening skills, which can
help me solve problems faster at work. I believe that my skills can help international students get
out of difficulties and make every international student feel the sense of belonging of UCSB.",Centrist,Fair,"I don't know much, and I don't dare to make a false
statement.","I do not support free tuition, but tuition can be reduced","This is exactly what I mentioned about psychological counseling for international
students. This service system has helped many UCSB students, but international students seem to
be excluded. They are afraid to share their worries and difficulties with others, because language
problems are sometimes misunderstood during consultations, and thus are not well treated.
As mentioned in my goal, increase more language options for international students and
recruit more staff who can communicate with international students. Language can give
international students a sense of security during counseling, instead of deliberately concealing
their condition because they are afraid that the counselor will not understand it.
In addition, some psychological terms cannot be well explained for international students,
which makes the treatment effect worse. This is a pity. So I hope that CAPS can prepare for the
multilingual system for international students as soon as possible, and promote it to international
students so that they know that school can help them.
appropriately.","I think that during the Covid-19 outbreak, it is everyone’s duty to reduce gatherings and
maintain social distancing. In order to protect the safety of everyone, organizations that violate
social regulations should be punished and criticized. Although it emphasizes the freedom of the
person and the freedom of gatherings, for the health of the masses, it is indispensable to abide by
the basic rules of the special period.
Those individuals/organizations who violate social regulations for the first time should be
educated and criticized, so that they understand the seriousness and harm of gatherings during
the Covid-19 outbreak. If this happens many times, the school can take more serious disciplinary
action.","Title IX office is a Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of
sex in education programs and activities. For international students, make sure international
survivors' voices are heard, give them a comfortable place to share stories, and raise awareness.
Let them know where to ask for help.
Support the work of the Title IX office in international students. Promote the Title IX
office to international students and tell them how to face it and the role of the Title IX office. The
International Student Forum invites the Title IX office to be a permanent residence to help solve
the difficulties of international survivors. Invite the Title IX office to give a multilingual lecture,
so that every international student can fully understand the system.
In order to help these survivors, the most important thing is about mental health. Therefore, to
ensure that their voices are heard is the most basic respect for these survivors.","For international students, the underrepresented groups of international students are
forgotten. Everyone called for the protection of underrepresented groups, but many international
students could not hear it. In order to allow international students to participate in the activities
of underrepresented groups, cooperation with UCSB's underrepresented groups can effectively
solve the worries of underrepresented groups of international students. For example, for LGBTQ
international students. To make LGBTQ international students feel safe and engaging, I will

create a forum for these students to talk about their worries and difficulties. And cooperate with
the LGBTQ organization of UCSB to support LGBTQ international students.
In addition, I think the school’s protection of underrepresented groups is real and
well-functioning. Creating unique communities for these underrepresented groups and
supporting them in holding unique activities I think can be added in the follow-up development.","Ask for more language options for CLAS and CAPS service to help international students
with their academic and mental flexibility. This article is very important for international
students. I think the passage of this law will allow international students to experience the same
treatment as ordinary students in the school. So that international students can live more
comfortably on campus. Language and communication are common problems for international
students, and it is precisely because of this problem that international students have not been able
to integrate into the campus well. The passage of the law can not only enhance the sense of
happiness of international students, but also make the campus of UCSB more diverse and more
voices heard.","In order to allow students to participate more actively in AS activities, I will choose to
promote more on social media. And through classmates and teachers, to show more students the
fun of the activity.
For international students, a series of activities for international students can be launched,
so that they can have a strong interest in participating. And cooperate with other organizations to
carry out publicity, so as to achieve the purpose of more people participating in activities.","To help students adjust from online status to offline hands-on lessons more quickly, I
think more offline ice-breaking activities can be held if the epidemic conditions permit. In
addition, you can contact various organizations and hold activities. There can be one-on-one
""guides"" to introduce the school and living environment to the students who move to IV.
Making friends and participating in activities can help students integrate into campus life
more quickly.","Generally speaking, the best solution is to get more students vaccinated. The school is
also working hard for this goal. Closed schools and online classes are both very good ways to
deal with the new coronavirus. For students in school, closing public facilities and maintaining
social distancing is the responsibility of every student.",,,,,,,

Cesar Castillo ,holly,Engineering Senator,Independent,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/14162722/cesar-castillo.jpg,,he/him/his,1st,Mechanical Engineering,,,"In my first year at UCSB, I’ve already noticed things that students aren’t happy with, and rather than wait for others to bring those issues to the table, I would like to raise them myself. The first was a big disconnect between first-year engineering students and their coursework. I, along with hundred of other engineering freshmen, took introductory courses but felt overwhelmed by the amount of work we had to complete, not to mention the fact that we lacked the in-person experience and thus came into the university without a sense of what proper study habits feel like. While the university plans to return to in-person instruction this fall and I believe it will achieve this goal, I am unsatisfied with the experience of the past year.
On a more general note, mental health in the College of Engineering is an issue worth examining. Students at all levels can experience burnout or feelings of inadequacy sometimes, and while CAPS may be a good place for students to seek help, there is the undeniable fact that other engineering students and faculty understand these feelings best. To that end, it may be useful for a peer group to be established so that engineering students have a safe and judgment-free environment to be heard and talk things through.
My overall goal as senator is to work with my fellow engineering students to identify what they feel most strongly about, and bring these issues to the Senate in a productive manner so that we can collectively find a solution and make UCSB a better place for everyone.","I have been working with freshman and sophomore engineering students to create a chapter of SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) International at UCSB. Over the past few months, we’ve worked together to contact other schools in Southern California to learn more about their experiences with their chapter as well as the national organization to help us with gaining faculty support and forming a Formula SAE Electric team. The team specifically will offer opportunities to all CoE majors to gain practical experience in open-wheel car construction and network with automotive and motorsport engineers with regards to career paths.
I have also been hired as orientation staff for this summer, where I went through a rigorous interview process to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities. The process required me to use my own agency so I could show what I was capable of, and the training I’ve undertaken since becoming a part of the staff has helped me to begin understanding the values of the university. These two experiences together have taught me to be proactive rather than reactive and make use of organizational contacts I may not be acquainted with to accomplish my goals.","The first bill I plan on introducing would involve having CAPS working closely with the College of Engineering. As previously stated, mental health in the College is a concern for students, and more can be done to help students deal with the issues they face on a daily basis. This bill would see CAPS working with upper-division students to establish an engineering support group where students can gather and speak freely about whatever they would like to discuss. These upper-division students would receive training on how to effectively provide advice and speak in a supportive way, and they would apply their own knowledge to form an engineering-specific discussion. This group would ideally be sponsored by the Engineering Student Council and sanctioned by the College of Engineering.
I would also like to explore a bill that discourages student groups and the University as a whole from collaborating with entities that profit from or sponsor human rights violations in China. It is apparent that the majority of UCSB students have a negative attitude towards companies and organizations which exploit humans for gain. To the greatest extent possible, A.S. and UCSB must distance themselves from these groups and raise awareness about their exploitative and inhumane practices.
Finally, I plan to introduce a bill that would establish a committee to investigate the functions of university administrators and determine whether or not certain positions are absolutely necessary for the well-being of the student population. It is also a known fact that students believe they are overpaying for education at the expense of administrative bloat, i.e. their tuition and fees are partially paying administrators who contribute little to education or student welfare. This committee would determine whether or not these beliefs are true and make recommendations on how the Senate should advocate for students going forward.","My platform is centered around mental health, reducing financial strain on students, and expanding access to industry resources. I believe that mental health is just as important as physical health and I’ll be working closely with my colleagues to develop legislation that will expand mental health resources for all students, especially those who are members of
underserved and marginalized communities on campus. As a university it should not be difficult to provide resources for these people, and I am confident that progress can be made on this issue. I am a big proponent of cutting unnecessary fees and charges that are redundant or do not
directly benefit the student body. As we saw during the 2020-2021 school year, students were unjustly charged for the maintenance of facilities that were not kept in use. The university should understand that students who are not able to use things due to circumstances outside of their control should not be billed for them. Even if the argument lies in the fact that the university cannot control the circumstances either, it must be understood that the university exists to serve its students rather than the students existing to pay the university.
Specific to the College of Engineering, I want to examine and expand opportunities for students to work with industry professionals and earn industry certifications during their undergraduate years. It is important that students be afforded the chance to take these exams if they choose without the worry of paying for the exam. I am particular to the Fundamentals of Engineering exam, but I’d like to see what students find themselves needing as they graduate and provide for those needs as well.","I hope to work closely with CAPS and the College of Engineering advising office to provide mental health support for engineering students. My vision is that CAPS can train the advising office as well as a peer support group on healthy techniques to help students through whatever issues they might be facing in their personal and academic lives. The idea behind this CoE-specific proposal is that some students might feel more comfortable speaking with others who have faced similar problems or who are a part of the same community.
With regards to the fee reduction, I look forward to working with campus administration, my Senate colleagues, the Student Advocate-General, and academic departments to identify areas where student-facing costs can be reduced over the long term. The goal is not to attack certain positions on campus, but rather to ensure that the duties supposedly being fulfilled match what we students need out of the university. When the university is aligned with the needs of the student body, we will know that our money is going to the services we really need.
The entire College of Engineering faculty will be a useful resource when looking at ways to support engineering students in seeking industry certifications. I specifically plan to look towards the staff engineers to provide insight on what preparation is useful for graduates entering industry, as well as the Engineering Student Council to understand what students are planning to do after graduation.","If remote instruction continues in the fall, I’ll make use of a few different platforms to reach out to engineering students. Firstly, the obvious Zoom office hours so that people can speak with me on whatever they might be concerned about. This will ensure that nobody feels disconnected from their senator and that I can meet and hear from people who may have different experiences from my own. I also plan to maintain an active Instagram account for my senatorial activities so that my constituents can learn more about my goals and be directly involved in the decision-making process. And lastly, I will be maintaining a presence in various engineering-related organizations and social spaces such as Discord servers, where many students gather on a regular basis to study and hang out. In this way I’ll be able to form meaningful relationships with the people I serve and establish connections with organizations I want to work with.","In high school I served as the student representative on our local school board, where a student body of 1700 people elected me to represent them. I heard the things that concerned and worried them, such as cuts to academic counseling services, a lack of accountability in administration, and even the closures of elementary schools they had attended growing up. I fought for what they wanted with the same passion they spoke about these issues amongst one another, and on some subjects the student voice did prevail over the district administration. Frankly, the whole experience was humbling in that nearly two thousand students trusted me to speak on their behalf. Coming into A.S. Senate, I know what it means to represent people in government (albeit of a different form) and therefore I have an understanding of what is expected of me from day one. Granted, as a freshman, it will take me time to become fully acquainted with A.S. operations and the goals and values of the Senate, but I am willing and ready to learn all there is so that I can better execute the duties of my office.",Left-leaning,"Good-While I did not actively follow the business of the Senate over the past year, the things I’ve seen on social media and in my email indicate that their intent is to do meaningful work on behalf of the students that elected them. One of the most notable pieces of legislation in my opinion is the A.S. grant, which helped students financially affected by COVID-19 to be able to afford basic needs.","Yes-As a matter of principle, the A.S. at UCSB should not associate itself with any company that profits from human rights violations anywhere in the world. I support a resolution divesting from companies that profit from human rights violations in Israel.","No-A university education should not be cost-prohibitive. We have been conditioned by myriad forces to believe that money is the key to everything in life, and this pushes low-income students out of an education unless they can secure scholarships. UCSB and all universities should be tuition-free, but at the same time, we should not insinuate that all high school graduates must go to a university. Some students are better served by trade school which may align with their interests; they should also be provided for.","For the most part, I think CAPS does a good job of doing its job. While I have not used any of the resources available through CAPS, I’ve heard from some of my peers that they got exactly what they needed out of the program. These friends spoke with a licensed psychologist
and were able to work through whatever issues they were having. For this I commend CAPS on its efficacy. At the same time, though, there are many stories of CAPS-associated personnel making student issues worse. Particularly on Reddit, these involve psychologists dismissing issues or making the student feel as though they are silly for bringing something up. These interactions often cause people mental and emotional distress and always lead to unfavorable outcomes. I am not particularly knowledgeable about the CAPS staff and so I would like to have a conversation about these stories to see if they are true, and if so, how best practices can be changed to provide a more positive outcome for everyone involved.","Partying has been a big problem during the pandemic in Isla Vista, and it’s unsurprising that the administration has taken a hands-off approach to the issue. As a university-sponsored organization, the fraternities and sororities of UCSB must be held to the same standards as any other organization. In a recent email to UCSB students, the administration announced that an intercollegiate athletics team’s season had been cancelled after a cluster of positive COVID cases. Where is this same response after fraternity members were seen on social media partying and inviting members of other Greek organizations to party as well? It is disappointing that a university which prides itself on accountability and equal treatment would turn a blind eye to actions that had the potential to hospitalize and kill people.
The fraternities and sororities seen on social media hosting parties should be suspended for a year to compensate for their recklessness as the rest of the student body was maintaining proper COVID protocols. The university must also acknowledge that it was complacent in allowing these parties to take place under its supervision and institute policies that give it more power over Greek life moving forward.","I am familiar with the function of a Title IX office but I am not familiar with UCSB’s Title IX office in particular. I think that the university should continue offering support to survivors of sexual assault through CAPS and encouraging survivors to report instances of sexual assault. In addition to these, I would support a mandatory training for Greek life and athletic teams that focuses on teaching about unsafe and predatory language so that members of these communities can keep each other accountable and make the university a safer place for
everyone. In cases where an assaulter speaks to others or communicates that they intend to cause harm, the training would be useful for others to call them out and have that person seek help instead of causing harm.","UCSB is a highly diverse campus with many ethnicities and gender identities represented among the student body. EOP and the MultiCultural Center provide lots of resources and events for underrepresented students to interact with one another and empower each other in all aspects of their lives. Through these organizations, the entire UCSB community can witness the diversity and range of backgrounds we have on campus, and learn more about the struggles we have all faced to get to where we are today. With that being said, there are still more things to be done. As a first-year student, I was informed that I had been admitted to EOP, but I had no idea how to take advantage of EOP or any of its resources. Now that the school year is almost over, I feel as though it’s a bad time to begin. I think some sort of mandatory introduction meeting would be a good thing to implement so that new EOP members feel welcomed, even if they don’t decide to take advantage of the resources offered to them. This can extend to other groups serving underrepresented communities as well, but telling students “Here are all the groups you can reach out to” is overwhelming compared to “Here are all the groups that will reach out to you to help you.”","The first bill I plan to author is one addressing the Greek life partying issue that was so prevalent over the past school year. The actions of the university and of the various fraternity/sorority councils were inadequate in preventing partying and holding members accountable. The bill would ask that Student Engagement & Leadership look into allegations of partying against fraternities and sororities, particularly those seen on the Instagram account ucsb.party, suspend culpable organizations for one year, and reprimand organization leadership for their role in allowing these parties to continue against University guidance and state law.
","As a candidate for Engineering Senator, I feel uniquely lucky in that my college is small enough to engage with everyone on a semi-regular basis. Through the use of social media such
as Instagram and Discord, I hope to connect with my constituents early and often. I plan to maintain an Instagram account for my A.S. Senate activities where people can learn about the weekly Senate business and provide their opinion on the proper action. I strongly believe that an elected representative should always act according to the will of the population that elected them; for this reason I’ll invite people to tell me how they think I should act on an item or a project. I also plan to maintain a more active presence on engineering-focused UCSB Discord servers, which many engineering students have been using throughout the pandemic to stay connected, study together, or simply hang out and make new friends. Being a real person instead of a political figure is important to constituents, and I am confident my fellow engineers will react positively.","I would continue efforts to make the student transition easier, especially for new first-years and transfer students. I think grading policies should continue to be flexible for the fall quarter, and potentially winter, as students return to normal on-campus life and a traditional academic experience. Having only lived in university housing since January, I would defer to my older Senate colleagues on in-person activity in Isla Vista and do what I can to support their proposals.","This past summer the university held orientations over Zoom, which I believed worked well despite not being the traditional experience. Remote instruction saw many instructors become more flexible in their policies (almost by magic) which was also a good thing for students. One major thing I noticed myself and others complaining about was the weekly Health and Wellness emails and virtual programming, which seemed consistently tone-deaf with respect to the student condition. Now that the pandemic is nearing its end as vaccines are administered, it is likely not worth investigating, but it was something of note.",,,,,,,
