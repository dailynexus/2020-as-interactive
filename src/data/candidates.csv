Yehuda Jian,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yehuda-Jian-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,"He, Him, His",2nd,Philosophy,"I am running for senate because I have a passion for changing my community for the better. I
love the people and atmosphere at UCSB and know that I can make the experience for future
students even better. As the Director of Legislative Accountability this year, I have connected
BCUs to their assigned Senators, handled any miscommunications or complaints about the
assignments, created a more modern and organized accountability system for both BCUs and
Senators by moving it from paper to digital, and I sat on the TPS/ratepayers board as the liaison
from the office of the IVP.  From early on I was drawn to student leadership and aside from my
role in AS, I’m on the Executive Boards of both Chabad and SSI. Even outside of my official
leadership positions, I have taken the initiative to lobby AS members and administrators alike to
advocate for the needs of the communities I am a part of. I was one of the main student voices
that supported the current Kosher/Halal food program and I continue to push for a more
permanent and steady solution with the creation of an entirely Kosher/Halal dining hall.",See above.,"The first bill I would introduce is a bill that would use the excess fees from students that AS
doesn’t use to reduce the overall cost of school through either a partial refund of whatever
wasn’t used, setting up a fund to be used for need based financial aid, or using the money to
subsidize cheaper textbooks. I would work with Finance and Business along with multiple facets
of the administration to make this a sustainable reality so that students get more from the
hundreds of dollars they pay to AS each year. The second would be a resolution calling for
better academic accommodations for religious students. There is no school policy about
religious accommodations other than the obligation to move a final. Whether it’s midterms,
quizzes homeworks or even attendance, the decision is up to the professor and that means that
religious students will never know if they can rely on accommodations or not. This resolution will
show religious students that someone is in their corner and I will work with the administration,
Hillel, MSA and various other religious orgs to make the demands of this resolution a reality.
The third thing I would pass would be a bill to allocate funding for the implementation of the
Blue-Light system and put together a task force to get it done. I will work with administration,
IVTU, IVCSD and the EVPLA to put together this task force and get the job done. It has been
way too long since the implementation of the first Blue-Lights on campus and I think it is about
time IV started feeling safer at night.","The most important parts of my platform and how I plan to achieve them are detailed above.
I also plan to work with the SRB, Library and UCEN to implement more AS charging stations so
that when midterms or finals come around, these spaces are more capable of dealing with the
increase in students spending a lot of time there. My final platform is to work with IVTU, IVCSD
and the EVPLA to get more street lighting in Isla Vista and build on the work that has already
been started in years passed.","I have detailed above who I will be working with for each part of my platform and will be open
to working with and hearing from any org or entity not already listed. I am here to give a voice to
my constituents and am happy to work with any org or entity that helps me do that.","I will hold weekly zoom office hours that will be posted on my Senate Facebook page and will
be open to making appointments outside of those office hours. I will also be available through
email, facebook messenger or whatever platform of communication works best with the student.
I plan to check all these forms of communication by the end of each day and respond to them as
soon as i read them or as soon as I have an answer. If for whatever reason a student cannot
find a time to actually meet with me, I will create a google form that will be posted on my Senate
Facebook page with a comments box that I will use to get feedback from students and still have
a way to listen to what they need to talk to me about. All of my personal social media account
information will also be made available along with my phone number, I understand the
importance of being available to my constituents and am prepared to go the extra mile to do so.","After spending a year in AS I have a clear idea of what is going well and what needs
improvement. I have specific ideas and plans on how to go about making these changes. I am
very excited to work with other senators who want to make change like I do and look forward to
working with Senators with different opinions to find a middleground where everyone benefits. I
have experience directly consulting Legal Code at the request of the IVP and I’m familiar with
the procedures of Senate meetings so I can hit the ground running once I get elected and start
getting things done immediately. I have experience working with AS entities and the
administration and have made vital connections with those people that will help me achieve my
goals. I am very open to new ideas and will advocate for any student who comes to me with a
voice that needs to be heard. I care about our campus and will do everything in my power to
make it better.","Centrist, I have some opinions that are to the left and some to the right but they average out
in the middle.","Very Good, as the Director of Legislative Accountability, I have had the unique opportunity to
watch senators work and I witnessed a group that is overall very dedicated to the student body
and who really care about the important issues.","Divestment is connected to an extremely controversial issue with valid claims on both sides.
I personally am against Divestment and am pro-Israel. I would like to clarify however, that this
does not mean I don’t recognize the struggle of the palestinian people. I believe that the true
path to a peaceful resolution of the conflict is by building bridges between the communities not
by building walls, whether they be physical or financial. I don’t approve of most of the things the
Israeli government does or has done in the past, but one could say that about many countries
and yet I don’t see a reason to divest from companies that do business with those countries. As
a proud member of the Jewish community I believe that the Divestment resolution is
Anti-Semitic and the only proof needed for that is the majority of the Jewish community agreeing
that it is.","Yes, I believe that all higher education should be free but I would say that the best way to
get there is gradually with a good plan that doesn't leave teachers underpaid and resources and
facilities underfunded. UCSB was founded with the idea it would be free. I think that that is the
right way to go but just cutting tuition immediately presents too many problems. The best path in
my opinion is to gradually lower tuition over a period of time to allow the necessary adjustments
to be made.","From my personal experience, I think that the types of services available are adequate but
they do not have enough locations. Students should be able to easily fit a visit to CAPS into
their schedules, and if they spend most of their time around the Chem Building or Physical
Sciences, that can be quite difficult. The staff I have encountered at CAPS have always been
respectful, understanding and helpful. When I am elected, if any of my constituents expressed a
desire to fix the Mental Health system or make it better, I would not hesitate to do everything in
my power to do so. Mental Health is just as, if not more important than Physical Health,
especially to a student. It is the responsibility of any university to give their students the best
chance to succeed and that goes hand in hand with making sure all of their students can access
whatever resources are necessary to stay healthy, mentally and physically. For example, the
University could partner with Acacia to build a system where students who can’t get a CAPS
counselor, are helped without having to do any extra work.","The university did not handle the situation with the fraternities well at all. Sexual Harrasment
and Sexual Assault are not matters that should be taken lightly. After the allegations made in
Fall Quarter, I would expect those Frats to be kicked off of campus. Simply putting Frats on
social probation for the remainder of a quarter that was already almost over is not nearly
enough. Frats have to take real responsibility for what happened. I think they should have been
required to have some sort of real education on what sexual harassment or assault are and how
to actively prevent them. When the school fails to respond properly to something like this, it
sends a message to the student body that the school doesn’t care. This message is not only a
sad one but an unacceptable one. If the school required Green Dot training for all OSL groups
including Greek Life, I think it would be a good indicator that the administration cares and is
working to create a safer environment.","I think that Title IX is not strict enough on universities. Just mandating a system of report is
nice, but not enough. Schools should be forced to put policies in place that are in line with the
legal repercussions of sexual harrassment or sexual assault. The university should not be given
the opportunity to kick the can down the road and hope someone else does the job. People
need to be helped as soon as these things happen and not at the leisure of some bureaucracy.
For too long the voices of people who have been harassed or assaulted have been silenced for
no better reason than “They were asking for it dressed like that” or “they should have manned
up and said no”. We can no longer allow this bigotry to exist and when I am elected senator, I
will fight to eliminate it.","As someone from a religious background, I can say that while UCSB has some great
resources for underrepresented groups, it definitely could use some more work. For the
Religious Community specifically, there are very few ways that the University accommodates
our holidays and traditions. I once was forced to drop a class I needed for my major just
because the department refused to give me the accommodations I needed to have an equal
playing field with the rest of the class. When I asked the department head why they refused to
accomodate me they said that there was actually no policy that pertained to my situation and
that it was above their power to do anything about. In the end it took too long to set up a
meeting with the person who could have helped me and I was forced to request a late drop to
avoid the low grade I would have gotten from missing the first three weeks of the quarter. When
I am elected one of my first orders of business will be to set this right and work with the
administration to create real and sensible policies that take into account the needs of religious
students, and any other underrepresented groups who have to work harder to keep up just
because of their background.","The first bill I plan to author is a bill that will put money back in the hands of students. For
years AS entities have been given budgets that are larger than what they actually spend, and
the extra just goes into a rollover budget that they can use next year. All that does however, is
create even more extra money sitting around doing nothing. I plan to change that. I will write a
bill that puts any excess funds at the end of the year back in the hands of students. This would
lower the overall cost of student fees by way of reimbursement. This money could also be used
to lower the price of textbooks or create a scholarship program for students in financial need.
AS gets around 14 million dollars a year to work with, if even 5 percent of that were to be given
back to students  it would free up $700,000 to give back to students. Imagine a UCSB where
that 600 dollars a year you pay actually saves you 600 dollars in textbooks, that's the UCSB I
want to create.","When I was a freshman I wanted to get involved in student government but I couldn’t even
find the name Associated Students, let alone the room it was in. The Pearman fellowship is a
great way to get involved with Associated Students and the number of fellows it yielded was
much higher this past year than years past, but I think it can get much bigger and more
accessible. When I am elected, I will work with the Office of Admissions and the Creative Media
Unit to get the word out to students before they even start their first quarter at UCSB. As the
Director of Legislative Accountability, I know first hand what it’s like to try and keep the Senate
accountable. In my position in AS I have already created a digital system of accountability to
replace the extremely out of date one which was still on paper. When I am a Senator I will write
legislation to get updates on the  senate agenda, senate office hours, senate meeting times and
other information posted not just on the senate website, but on the Daily Nexus and Bottom Line
as well.","With the recent events of the COLA strike, it became clear to me that President Napolitano
did not place enough emphasis on the needs of Grad Students and TAs. My number one priority
from the next President would be an administrator who will fight for the needs of their undergrad
and grad students, their faculty and their staff. Many of us have been through the hell that is
going to advising from three different departments and somehow having 7 different answers to a
simple question. I want a President who will work towards a more cohesive campus. Our UC
President should work towards sensible policy that makes living as a UCSB student easier, not
more confusing. When students gather together to ask for something that is quite basic, the UC
President should listen to what they have to say and work towards a real compromise if they
don’t have the means to fully grant these requests. The UC President is supposed to be the
embodiment of the voices of students, faculty and staff, I want the next one to fit that
description.",,
Yuval Cohen,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yuval-Cohen-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,2nd,Political Science/Middle East Studies,"I became involved with Associated Students my freshman year of college and I absolutely fell in
love with it. The community and people that make up AS all share a similar passion for UCSB
and want to see it become the best it can be. During my short time at UCSB, I have been able to
use my passion to enact change throughout my communities. By serving on the senate, I hope to
accomplish so much more. I am running because I want to be a voice for my community, I want
to represent the students, and I want to create an environment that everyone wants to be a part of.
I believe that senate is the perfect platform and place to come together and collaborate on ideas
that can truly make a difference, and that is something that I want to be involved in.","I have been involved in the AS Office of the President for two years now. My
freshman year, I was a fellow, and this year I am currently the Director of Dream
Scholar Affairs. As a fellow, I got to learn more about AS as a whole and all of the
moving parts that make it successful at UCSB. By my second year, I knew I wanted to
continue my work in the Office of the President. I had watched the individual who had
my previous position do a phenomenal job, and I wanted to bring my ideas to the
table. Being an undocumented student, I am very connected to my position as Director
of Dream Scholar Affairs. It has allowed me to make connections throughout my
community and raise awareness about undocumented students. I have seen things that
need to change, and I know what path they must take. This experience specifically has
prepared me to be a senator because I know how AS functions and what I can do as a
senator to make an impact.","The first resolution I would like to introduce revolves around helping undocumented
students. In June, the Supreme Court is expected to release their decision on whether
or not DACA will continue. This decision is going to impact a great number of
students, including myself. I know that before I became the Director of Dream Scholar
Affairs, I was totally unsure about the resources we have at UCSB for undocumented
students. I want to create a bill that works to advertise these resources and raise
awareness throughout the entire school about undocumented students. We need more
forums, events, and information for students, documented and undocumented. A
second resolution I would like to introduce is to partner with the Isla Vista Compost
Collective and increase the amount of compost bins throughout Isla Vista.
Sustainability is very important to me, and IVCC does a great job of composting. My
house is filled with compost bins, in Isla Vista and at my family’s home. Since IVCC
just partnered with the Isla Vista Community Services District so that they can have
more resources, this year would be a perfect time to increase access to compost bins
throughout Isla Vista. Restaurants, homes, lecture halls, and more places in Isla Vista
should have available composting bins. A third resolution I would like to introduce
while in office is to collaborate with the Recreation Center and possibly IVFP, UCPD,
and CFOs to create access to self defense classes. This school year, the community
definitely felt a lack of safety and security. I believe that all students should have the
option to learn how to defend themselves from any situation. No one should ever be in
a position where they feel vulnerable. Self defense classes are a perfect way to gain
that sense of extra security.","My platform revolves around the students and meeting their needs based on what I
have seen at UCSB for the past two years. Through my connections, I have gained a
good sense in realizing the things that need to change. My goals while in office will be
to revolve my actions around the students. There are so many voices and opinions that
never get heard, and my platform hopes to reach all of those students who want to see
change but do not know how to do something about it. I am very passionate about each
of my platform statements because I have a connection to each point. My biggest goal
would have to be increasing transparency and communication. I have always been a
very open and honest individual, so I hope to reflect that on my position as a senator as
well.","I hope to work with Undocumented Student Services (USS), the Mental Health Task
Force, Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), Environmental Affairs Board, AS
Office of the President, AS Food Bank, Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), and many
more. These are the main organizations and entities that I would love to collaborate
with. I believe in their mission and I want to do everything I can to help them
accomplish what they wish. I love coming together with different, yet like-minded
individuals because I know that it can result in something great.","I plan on hosting “online office hours,” like a lot of professors and TAs are currently
doing. I will be on Zoom at certain times or people can schedule a time that works for
them to meet with me. I want to be as available as possible, so I will be very active on
social media and platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, etc. I want constituents to
have full access to me and know that they should never hesitate to reach out. I believe
that by staying involved online and on commonly frequented pages or apps, I can
make it aware to students that I want to and will work to meet their needs.","When I was growing up, it was always hard for me to know what I wanted to be. All
the kids my age would have their dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers. But I was
all over the place, and I would simply base my future on what Netflix show I was
addicted to at the moment. When I began applying to colleges, I still did not know
what I wanted to do. I had to reflect on my entire life. That was when I realized that
everything I had done up to that point screamed leadership. I was in student
government all 4 years of high school and I would even go to Sacramento and lobby
every year. These were always things I loved doing, and I never thought I could ever
turn it into a career or something more. Senior year, I promised myself I would
become involved in student government again wherever I ended up. All of freshman
year, I joined everything that sounded remotely interesting to me, which is how I fell
in love with AS. UCSB took my love of community, leading, and government and
showed me that there was so much more I could bring to the table. My experience and
passion has been building up to this, and I know that I would do an amazing job as a
senator. As someone who has always had to work a little bit harder to prove myself, I
know that I can advocate for students and make the changes that they wish to see
within their university and community. I am overall super excited for this entire
journey no matter what happens.",Left-leaning,"Very Good. I believe that the work of the 70th Senate has been very sufficient. They have accomplished
a lot, my personal favorite being the creation of a new Senate seat for international students.
But as always, more work can be done to meet the needs of students.","No. This is a very controversial topic, especially since UCSB is the only UC that has not
voted in favor of this resolution. There is a great lack of knowledge circling this topic
and I believe that we must educate students on what the results of favoring BDS
would look like. Although I would not vote in favor of it, I will be open and impartial
to all other views and I am always eager to learn more.","No. UCSB should not be tuition-free at this time because
of all the resources and academics on campus that
must be funded. But, I do believe in lowering student
fees and making college more affordable to all through
continued lobbying efforts to fund the UC.","I believe that UCSB has a lot of services available to students. As a member of the AS Office
of the President, I was involved in coordinating the Mental Health Town Hall. During the
town hall, I learned a lot more about available resources on campus, CAPS being the main
one. A big issue with CAPS is the long wait times. There are a lot of instances where
students cannot wait for an appointment. I think by advertising the other resources, such as
peer groups or the emergency call-line, students can be educated on other options they may
have. Overall, CAPS can definitely improve their efficiency, but there are more services
available at UCSB besides CAPS that should be publicized and utilized more.","I believe that the university could have handled the situation better in the beginning. They
were slow to provide resources and help to students in need or those questioning everything
that was happening. Students really needed more information, yet they did not receive
enough information from the university reports. I believe the current exec board did a great
job of providing outlets to address the sexual assault instances, such as creating the UCSB
Safer Social Event Task Force. As time passed, the situation was addressed better, but the
initial response could have been better.","I believe that Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses.
But, there are things we can do to improve the system. The expansion of programs to help
fight sexual assault and providing more resources to survivors should be available. As a
Senator, I will work towards this by meeting the needs of my constituents.","The university itself should focus on hearing the voices of these communities and
meeting their needs. The student-led Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+, and other programs
should receive extra funding and help with expansion. These communities are doing a
great job with events and promoting awareness on campus. Overall, UCSB is making
great improvement in providing resources and practicing inclusion.","My first resolution that I plan to author if I am elected to serve on the Senate is a bill to
continue and expand the Mental Health Town Hall. This past school year, the Mental
Health Town Hall was run by the Office of the President. I believe if the Senate backs and
funds this event, it can grow and reach even more people. This town hall was very
beneficial for me and answered a lot of my questions surrounding mental health,
especially at UCSB. More students should be attending this town hall because everyone
should be educated about mental health. I think that this bill will greatly benefit and help
students.","I believe that with all of the resources we have, we should be advertising them to
students more. Through social media influence, email, and on-campus
advertisements, students can become more informed.  I also think that the student
body should stay informed through programs like GOLD and GauchoSpace. Students
regularly check these systems, and if there are updates from Associated Students on
these sites as soon as students log in, I think that could have a great influence on
UCSB’s campus.","Being UC President is a very important role that should be filled by a qualified and
experienced individual. I think the top priorities for the next UC President should be about
maintaining strong and adequate health services on each campus. Considering what is
currently going on in our world with the corona virus outbreak, health should be the number
one priority. At a campus like UCSB for example, our student health center should have
easier access. More important topics include lowering tuition, providing enough resources
for undocumented students following the upcoming announcement of the Supreme Court
decision on DACA, and sustainability on each campus (composting centers, reducing waste,
etc.).",,
