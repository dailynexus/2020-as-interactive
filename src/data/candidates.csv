Taylor Tait,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Taylor-Tait-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,1st,Sociology & Geography Double Major,,,"I am running for Senate because I believe what our campus needs is someone who is compassionate and will listen to and value the ideas of all Gauchos, and not only a few select groups. I want to use my experience and privileges to provide a platform for underrepresented groups on campus to express their concerns. As you’ll read below, I am well qualified and have a lot of outstanding ideas that have pushed me to pursue a spot in the 71st senate. 
","Since coming to UCSB, I’ve become involved with a variety of organizations that have helped me grow and prepared me to be a senator. I joined RHA as an Activities Coordinator for Manzanita Village’s Hall Council. It was a great experience that helped me learn the ropes of on-campus politics on a much smaller scale than A.S. Senate. I’ve involved myself in various student activist groups, advocating for the banning of fracking in Santa Barbara and participating in many COLA protests. I also pushed myself to get involved in different communities of our school by joining Club Water Polo. Being a part of a club sport has helped me meet people I wouldn’t ordinarily get to, and has allowed for me to witness firsthand how A.S. impacts all of our students. 
","While in office, the main three issues I plan to address are food insecurity, combating climate change on a local and broader scale, and prioritizing mental health. In depth, I would like to increase funding for campus organizations that work to combat food insecurity such as the A.S. Food Bank. I hope to help these organizations grow so they have enough resources to support more of our student population and eventually expand the variety and multitudes of other life essentials such as toiletries and first aid. In regards to the climate crisis, I would like to enact resolutions that will promote environmental sustainability on our campus. I would like to accomplish this by instating campus policies such as reducing light pollution and energy waste in our campus buildings and refusing to support businesses involved in fracking, unethical palm oil, and other industries that are detrimental to our planet. And, importantly, I want to aid in the efforts to improve our mental health resources and make them easier to navigate through the creation of online apps, increasing funds, and a variety of other means.
","Efficiency and transparency best describe the foundation of my platform. Overall, I would consider my vision to be environmentally conscious and human rights oriented. Mainly, I hope to increase environmental sustainability efforts in our community by raising climate change awareness, bringing compost bins to popular areas on campus, and instating other practices that will help UCSB become a truly green campus. I also would like to address the reality of food insecurity on our campus by growing and expanding our AS food bank, making our farmer’s markets more accessible, allowing guests to use students’ meal swipes instead of charging it to their BARC account, and increasing the capacity of donating meal swipes. As a senator, I will also strive to increase recognition and transparency for all boards, committees, units, and other organizations on our campus. Every Gaucho, both big and small, deserves to have their voice heard. Advocating for improvement of our Student Health processes is something I also prioritize; I plan to start this action through conversations with our school administration. As a senator, I will strive to embody the ideals of all members of our Gaucho community. I’ll take on this position with openness in discussing and advocating for the concerns and well-being of our UCSB community. 
","There are so many incredible groups in our community, if there was enough time to join every board, committee, and unit I would in a heartbeat. But realistically, I hope to be able to work with the Food Bank, Environmental Affairs Board, and the Student Commission on Racial Equality. I would be excited to work in any organization or entity, but these are just a few that I would like to collaborate with in order to achieve the vision of my platform. 
","In the unfortunate instance that our summer and fall quarters move to be online, I plan on doing everything I can to be available and transparent to my constituents. Some of the ways I will do this are to hold weekly zoom office hours and be available for scheduling appointments, so that I have the opportunity to discuss concerns and ideas face to face with students. Additionally, I will be active on my senate Facebook, updating my page constantly with what happens in the Senate and the actions I take to better our community. 
","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I am driven, compassionate, and am eager to learn about and reflect the interests of our students. What our campus needs is someone who is dependable and will work in favor of all our students’ ideals. I’ve spent the past six years working in various leadership positions, growing to encompass a variety of skills that would make me perfect for this position. Some organizations I’ve had the privilege to work with include: Manzanita Hall Council (as an Activities Chair), WE Charity (as a School Liaison), Special Olympics (as a District-Wide Events Assistant Coordinator), and founding an environmental nonprofit that focuses on ocean conservation. Each of these positions has taught me what it means to be a leader and how to become a voice for the people. My work ethic would be best described as resilient, organized, and creative. I have a true passion for considering the perspectives and values of others and finding a way to incorporate them into the bigger picture. For all these reasons and more, I am well qualified and will thrive as your next On-Campus Senator.
","Left-leaning 
","Very Good; the 70th Senate has moved mountains in advocating in the students’ interest. They accomplished so much in the past year, from lobbying to increase various BCU funds and utilizing a sexual assault task force to better combat sexual violence in our community, to reaching beyond our campus to support students negatively affected by the Mauna Kea telescope contruction. What I appreciate about the efforts of our previous senate is how dedicated they were when it came to improving life beyond on-campus means. I want to build upon their work by collaborating with more organizations to provide them more transparency and opportunities. 
","This topic has been widely debated throughout the years at UCSB. Personally, I feel that I am not informed enough to take a position on this topic. What I will say is that UCSB would benefit from exploring the idea of establishing relationships with companies that are confirmed to be ethically sound. 
","It’s no argument that the tuition we students pay greatly supports the multitude of organizations and resources that make our university as great as it is. Although I am not completely confident of whether or not focusing the Senate’s time on abolishing tuition for UCSB is going to be effective, I firmly believe in advocating for reducing our tuition prices. Furthering this, scholarships and other forms of financial aid should be extremely expanded so that they can compensate for tuition and student fees. There needs to be more availability of scholarships so students who come from all backgrounds and classes can be supported. Financial hardships should not prevent people from gaining access to education. 
","From CAPS to Health and Wellness, our campus is blessed to have multiple resources where Gauchos can reach out for support. I especially appreciate how easy it is to discover Health and Wellness events as well as our school’s overall efforts to not only normalize maintaining mental health, but prioritizing it over social and even academic success. Overall, I believe that our mental health services are inadequate due to the large demand that has come to overwhelm our services. Every aspect of mental services I have encountered has proven to be incredibly popular and therefore busy. Resources can be difficult to navigate. Scheduling therapy appointments is a grueling task, especially considering the toll it takes on our students’ already full schedules. Even the crowds of pet therapy dogs during dead week were packed. What I propose is an increase in funding and support of mental health services and an exploration of possibly offering virtual therapy appointments. The foundation of our community is well being, and I stand for investing in every Gaucho’s mental health. 
","The speed of UCSB’s response could have been much faster. In the quarter system, it’s been shown that the fast pace causes things to fall through the cracks, so to speak. But sexual assault is no light matter, and should be addressed with exceptional urgency and care, especially when multiple cases arise in the span of weeks. As in any situation, there could have been things our university could have done to handle it better. Personally, I found the school wide emails, presented sometimes weeks after the incident, to be ill timed. More transparency with our administration's actions, and to really know that there are executives and organizations actively working to address these reports, could help ease the mind of our community in the possibility of future sexual assault cases. Furthermore, supporting organizations including Take Back the Night will help aid the university’s response and actions to sexual violence in our community.
","I believe that Title IX is a decent base for a system to address sexual assault. However, it’s merely a foundation for the complex and careful works that are needed to be put into place in order to smooth out the many flaws of this legislation. Currently, Title IX does a mediocre job in accepting the worth of sexual assault survivors. It also lacks an incentive for our justice system to approach and address these reports with the same speed and effort as any other criminal case. Especially when Title IX is implicated in communities where sexual assault cases are notoriously high, I believe that UCs absolutely need further legislation if they hope to create safer environments. There is more that could be done to improve upon how UC campuses approach these situations. 
","I don’t want to speak on behalf of these groups, but from what I have seen so far UCSB has made waves in representing and supporting its communities that are often underrepresented and mistreated. A variety of student unions, organizations, and specialty housing are features that are unparalleled to some universities in our country. Coming to UCSB, one of the first things that I found captivating was the normalization of introducing pronouns when meeting people. I believe that the little, everyday actions of recognition and inclusion form a massive impact on our community. Promoting this mindset will only strengthen our Gaucho community. As someone who grew up in a SoCal inland suburb, I found it surprising how little recognition our beautifully diverse groups, clubs, and organizations received. In high school, showcasing and supporting the BSU, Polynesian club, and disabled students was something I came to normalize; and with that came an appreciation and admiration for these underrepresented communities. In light of my experiences, I urge for bringing the spotlight to various historically underrepresented groups on campus and truly supporting all members of UCSB is absolutely vital. As a senator, I plan to support these well deserving groups and help them further their voices on our campus. 
","If I am elected to serve, one of the first bills or resolutions I plan on authoring would be to increase funding for organizations that aid against food insecurity. Specifically expanding resources and accessibility to the A.S. Food Bank, farmers market, and more. I feel that this is a priority of mine because food insecurity is a huge concern for many students, especially those who cannot afford the lofty costs of meal plans. Students should only have to focus on their studies and getting involved, not worrying over where their next meals are coming from. 
","As a senator, I would strive to make the everyday functions of A.S. more transparent by keeping our media even more up to date and opening up discussions of A.S. actions. As a first year, I’m still understanding all the ins and outs of A.S., and it’s difficult to grasp an adequate understanding of what A.S. does for our university if you don’t have friends who are older. It’s important to involve our younger Gauchos in campus politics so that they have a better understanding and appreciation of what makes our campus, and, eventually, they can help shape and improve upon the efforts of those who came before them. I hope to bring everyday routines of AS leaders through the means of social media, email, and other various platforms. 
","As we say farewell to President Janet Napolitano and the legacy she leaves, many Gauchos look towards the possibilities of the upcoming UC President. In light of the COLA protests, a priority I see for the next President is openness towards students and faculty. What troubled many with Janey Napoltano’s approach to COLA was her downwright rejection in speaking with students. We as investors of these institutions deserve to have our voices heard. Whomever the next UC President will be, I believe it should be someone to reflect all the needs of our diverse UC student bodies.

Adam Majcher,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Adam-Majcher-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,He/Him/His,1st,Political Science & History Double Major,,,"I am running to be Senator with the 71st Senate because I want to make UCSB a better place than it was when I arrived. Having been a fellow as part of the AS Pearman Fellowship Program this year, I have witnessed Senators make big, positive changes to the campus. Now I feel it’s my time to implement my own positive changes after watching so many people do great work. I have loved attending UCSB so far, this school has given me so much and I am dedicated to improving the student life here. While I adore UCSB, there is always more work to be done, and I have noticed a plethora of things that I think could make even better. Listening to my friends talk about various problems they have experienced, and noticing things myself like the difficulty in learning more about, joining, and advertising clubs inspired me to run for Senate
and make positive changes to things that I noticed were not functioning as well as they could be. I want to make the campus safer, increase student activity and engagement in the community, and make UCSB better than it already is, and I will achieve these goals as a Senator.","I have been a part of various clubs and organizations on campus, such as the Fencing team and IV Arts. However, the thing that I feel has prepared me the most to be a Senator is being a fellow for Senator Tyler Ferguson in the A.S. Fellowship Program. Learning about all parts of AS, including all of the various entities, responsibilities of various positions, requirements for writing a resolution, the resources available on campus, how clubs are financed, and countless other things has really prepared me for being a Senator, and I am very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the program. Furthermore, I have attended many Senate meetings throughout the school year, and have even been a Proxy for multiple Senators at meetings, so I understand how Senate functions and flows. This will put me ahead of a lot of my opponents, as I have the capability to enact meaningful change at the onset of the school year.","Some of my biggest goals as a Senator are creating a new app called the Gaucho Back app, creating a weekend long club rush event in Fall Quarter, overhauling the UCSB clubs website and adding a new “Club Events” tab to Go Gaucho! The Gaucho Back app resolutions would ask for funding in order to create the app (or, alternatively add its functionality to an already existing app like Shoreline if creating a new appproves difficult) and also to advertise it to the student body. This app would allow UCSB students in danger to press a button to immediately notify local authorities to come to their location, saving a lot of time. The goal of this app is to increase campus security by not only allowing a faster response time to any student in danger, but also to deter anyone from putting students in danger in the first place. The weekend long club rush event resolution would be the first resolution that I would write, because it is vital that the club rush event happens relatively early in the school year. This resolution would ask for funds for the various stands and advertisement required for the event to be successful, and I would be in contact with many clubs to get them on board to come and advertise themselves the weekend that it occurs! The club rush would include representatives of UCSB clubs having stands in an area, and students attending in order to learn more about them and potentially join these clubs if they are interested! Another resolution that I would introduce would be a big one that would ask for approval of a complete overhaul of the faulty and unhelpful UCSB club website, and also ask for the approval for a new tab on Go Gaucho that would list campus events that are happening that day/week!","My platform would primarily consist of the campus club overhaul, the introduction of new measures to ensure the safety of students, and the expansion of resources for anyone seeking mental, physical, or emotional help.For the campus club overhaul, I would work closely and communicate frequently with campus clubs in order to organize more events and places for advertisement and ease of communication. Things such as the club rush event that I am proposing cannot happen if the clubs that would be present at the event do not know about it, so it is going to be crucial that I am in constant contact with these groups and their leaders in order to make the entire campus club system better. Furthermore, I would work with the developers and project leads of the Go Gaucho app in order to expand it to include club events. For the Gaucho Back app, I would work with local police departments and CSO’s to plan out an effective way to create the app and their response to it. It is crucial that there is effective communication between UCSB and the local authorities in order to create this app system. Finally, for the expansion of resources for mental, emotional, and physical health, I would work with the Mental Health Task Force, would attend Mental Health Town Halls, and communicate with and work with various organizations on campus such as CAPS, CARE, Health and Wellness, and Student Health in order to spread information about ALL of the resources available to students, rather than just flood everyone into CAPS and have it be overwhelmed (although it is still important to increase the resources given to these organizations on top of spreading information).",See #4 above,"Communication with the student body is absolutely crucial for any Senator to effectively do their job, so should the shift to online courses continue into the Summer and Fall, I would make sure that I am able to be reached by students multiple times throughout the week. First of all, I would hold weekly scheduled zoom meetings for anyone who has ideas, suggestions, or problems that they would like for me to hear and address, and I would advertise these meetings on social media so that students would know about them. I would also hold individual zoom appointments throughout the week for any students who are interested, in order to ensure that every voice is heard. Furthermore, I would frequently post about updates and important events on social media, in order to keep the student body informed on all of the things happening within the Senate and AS as a whole. Additionally, I would have a Facebook or Instagram account specifically for myself as a Senator where I would be active and hold weekly discussion posts that students can comment on with any ideas and changes that they think would make UCSB a better place!","I think I am the best candidate for this position because I have the motivation, experience, and ideas necessary to effectively make the campus a better place while I am in office. I have been a part of AS throughout this year as a part of the Fellowship program, and through this I have gained tons of knowledge on how AS, and specifically the Senate, runs and functions. I am familiar with how meetings flow and how to write bills and resolutions, so I am experienced enough to effectively utilize the position in order to make positive changes for the campus! Furthermore, I have a lot of ideas based on my own firsthand experience, and the experiences of my friends and various UCSB students that can greatly improve student life, especially for first year students like myself, in the coming years. Something like the Gaucho Back app can greatly help increase campus safety, and the revamp to the UCSB club website and introduction of events on the Gaucho Back app can substantially increase student engagement with the campus, and both are relatively creative ideas that can increase the quality of campus life substantially. I am also extremely motivated to make these changes happen! I have watched the 70th Senate be extremely impactful and make tons of positive changes in the past few months, and I’m ready and excited to create positive change for the school myself!","left-leaning 
","Very Good. Having attended many Senate meetings and witnessing various legislation that passed, I do think that the 70th Senate did a very good job at addressing the needs of the student body. From bills such as the International Student Bill to demanding rollover swipes, from passionately advocating for increased campus security to supporting the COLA strike, I think that this year’s Senate actively represented the wants and needs of the student body. I do wish that the 70th Senate focused a bit more at improving mental health facilities and spreading information regarding campus resources, however.","While I fully acknowledge the importance of the issue of divestment, I think there is too much gray area on both sides of the argument to take a firm “yes” or “no” stance. I look forward to learning more about the issue and consulting students to make a decision that best represents the stance of the student body.","Yes. I do believe that in an ideal world, education of all levels should be tuition free and readily available for anyone who chooses that path. However, until a better system is established nationwide and/or in California, some form of tuition is necessary to keep UCSB running and, especially, to give faculty a satisfactory paycheck. I believe the problem is moreso in the higher government of the United States rather than UCSB itself, and that tuition free education for all at UCSB is very difficult to achieve by the school itself. Rather, United States politics must fundamentally change.","No, the mental health services at UCSB are far from adequate. A friend of mine who was seeking an appointment at CAPS was told to wait in a multi-hour line just to sign up for a three month waitlist! Efforts such as dog therapy days and massage chairs are admirable, but far from adequate for a University that is home to over 20,000 students and requires the completion of multiple mental health modules for first year students. An important part of my campaign is to substantially increase the funds given to CAPS, greatly increasing the amount of staff in the facility, which in turn would help with the ridiculous wait times. Furthermore, I aim to expand the resources available to victims of physical, emotional, and sexual violence and spread information about their existence so that students are able to know about them should they ever need them. Additionally, there are many resources available to UCSB students that are poorly advertised by the school that offer services similar to those of CAPS. Groups such as the Mental Health Task Force and events such as Mental Health Town Halls are trying to spread information regarding things such as the Alcohol and Drug Program, Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), Health and Wellness, and Student Health Services. As a Senator, I would continue the efforts of these organizations, and work with these programs to continue improving the mental health counseling available for students!","Yes, the university could have handled the situation much, much better. While the complaints that the response was slow are entirely valid and accurate, I think the bigger failure was that the university did absolutely nothing to prevent potential future incidents of sexual assault on campus. UCSB needs to take a proactive rather than a reactive approach to physical and sexual assault, actively taking measures to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place rather than simply giving a delayed response that does not fix anything after horrible incidents like this happen. One of the most important parts of my campaign is the creation of an app (ideally named Gaucho Back) that has an emergency distress button that immediately notifies local authorities to come to one’s location. The presence of such an app that allows for extremely quick action would not only deter people from committing acts of assault, but it would also allow for help to come much faster than something like calling 911. Furthermore, there needs to be more resources on campus for victims of assault, something that I will focus on improving should I be elected to the Senate. There have been multiple cases of sexual and physical violence on or near our campus in the past year, and it is vital that these individuals receive the help and support that they need. Another big part of my campaign is spreading information about and advertising various clubs, organizations, and facilities on campus, and giving students the information of the existence of such resources for victims of assault can greatly help in them being utilized for students to receive the help that they need.","Title IX is not an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. While the law was a relatively effective as a stepping stone in the goal of creating campuses free of various types of discrimination, it fails to specifically account for many detrimental issues, such as sexual assault and transphobia. Furthermore, with the current political administration’s continuous efforts to reverse protections of Title IX, especially regarding transgender students and the investigation of sexual assault cases, the law is not powerful enough nor specific enough to effectively prevent sexual discrimination on college campuses, much less sexual assault. There needs to be more provisions put in place to guarantee that all sexual assault cases are thoroughly investigated, that transgender students are provided rights that are associated with the gender that they identify with, and clearer, more defined laws to prevent sexual discrimination and sexual assault. It is imperative that there are better measures implemented by the school to combat sexual assault on our campus, and a key part of my campaign, the implementation of an app that allows a UCSB student to immediately send a distress signal to local authorities, notifying them to immediately come to that student’s location, would go a long way in helping with this.","Part of what makes UCSB so special is how diverse the backgrounds of the community are, and how students from all over the world and from completely different walks of life are able to come together to learn and create an amazing community. As a gay student myself, I personally have never experienced any forms of harassment or discrimination directed at me at UCSB, and there are numerous resources that I am aware of for the LGBTQ+ community on campus, which is something that I do think UCSB is doing quite well. I am a strong believer in equity over equality, and, while there are many resources and groups available at UCSB for students who are members of historically underrepresented groups, more work can always be done. It is important to remember that members of racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities very disproportionately account for cases of violence and abuse both on college campuses and in the United States at large. This is just another reason why it is so crucial to effectively deal with and prevent cases of physical and sexual violence from occuring on our campus, and why UCSB’s response to the multiple cases of sexual assault and the case of anti-LGBTQ+ violence that occurred this year was so unacceptable and inadequate. Taking a proactive stance and creating measures that would prevent instances of violence from occurring in the first place is crucial to the wellbeing of the community, and, again, the Gaucho Back app would be a great place to start. The International Student Bill that I was a student sponsor for is a crucial step in increasing the inclusivity of A.S. and ensuring that all groups on campus have a voice and are represented, as international students have historically been extremely underrepresented within student government at UCSB. Finally, I will make sure to be in constant contact with students from all backgrounds in order to effectively represent and respond to the needs of the student body. I will do everything in my power as a Senator to ensure that every student has a voice, feels safe, and is represented during their time at UCSB.","While I believe that the creation of the Gaucho Back app is very important, the first thing that I would pass is an overhaul to the campus club website and the creation of a club rush weekend within the first quarter of the school year. One of my biggest goals as a Senator would be to increase the information spread of events, clubs, and facilities, and these organizations usually recruit towards the start of the school year, so focusing on this would be my first priority as it is so frontloaded in the school year. One of the biggest problems that I experienced at UCSB is the difficulty of finding, advertising, and joining clubs. There were small club joining events during the weekday that lasted an hour or two, and I had class during them. The clubs that are usually lining the path by the arbor are just a fraction of all the ones present on campus. I would work with club leaders to establish a “club rush” weekend where clubs would have stands in a large open space, and students would see flyers for it all over campus and be able to attend, learn about, and join various clubs on campus. Furthermore, the website for clubs is a bit of a mess as it is difficult to navigate and has little to no information about any of the clubs that are listed. Having a club database online would help students find, learn more about, and reach out to clubs that they are interested in and join them in order to get more involved in campus life during their first, and subsequent, years. Finally, I often see friends going to incredible events going on around campus on social media that I never even realized were happening! As Senator, I would push for an extra tab on the Go Gaucho app that would list all events that are occurring within the week. This free advertisement would greatly help spread information about the events that students and members of the UCSB community are hosting, and make the information for them easily accessible for the student body. The success of UCSB as a campus is largely linked to the engagement and involvement of the student body in campus activities. Bolstering this and the entire system around it can only help improve life for the whole community!","As mentioned above, one of my biggest goals as a Senator would be to greatly increase the information present regarding clubs and campus events, and this includes A.S. A.S. events would similarly be listed on the Go Gaucho app, alongside other community events, and the ability to sit in on Senate meetings or attend Senator or Executive office hours would be made much more public in an attempt to get more students involved in A.S. activities. Furthermore, social media is crucial in communicating to the student body, and I would frequently post about important events or bills that are being discussed in order to get students more involved and encourage them to come to speak at Senate meetings about their thoughts, concerns, and suggestions. The school newspaper covers important and groundbreaking updates that happen in A.S., and as a Senator I would work with various on campus media sources in order to publicize events happening in the school. Communication and information are crucial in not only informing the student body of what their representatives are doing in office, but also to encourage students to take an active part in their community and have a say where their money goes to.","The top priorities for the next UC President is to, first and foremost, listen to the students and faculty of UC campuses and react effectively with their concerns and needs. Campus safety must be a top priority, especially given the physical and sexual violence that has occurred within the past school year. Furthermore, with huge events such as the COLA strike and COVID-19 outbreak currently happening, the next UC President must react well to being under pressure, and be ready to address crises that can sprout at any moment. The students at UC universities must be the top priority of the next UC President, and our safety and education should be their top concern. Communication between the UC President and the students is vital, and assembling town hall style events with UC students could be a great way for them to learn about our concerns, complaints, and suggestions. Addressing current issues such as the COVID-19 outbreak and how it affects our campuses and meeting the needs of Graduate students who are receiving wages below the poverty line are both crucial in the moment, however, I think that most importantly the next UC President must be willing to communicate and cooperate with students and faculty in order to resolve these problems and any future ones that may occur.",,,,"My platform would primarily consist of the campus club overhaul, the introduction of new measures to ensure the safety of students, and the expansion of resources for anyone seeking mental, physical, or emotional help.For the campus club overhaul, I would work closely and communicate frequently with campus clubs in order to organize more events and places for advertisement and ease of communication. Things such as the club rush event that I am proposing cannot happen if the clubs that would be present at the event do not know about it, so it is going to be crucial that I am in constant contact with these groups and their leaders in order to make the entire campus club system better.

It is crucial that there is effective communication between UCSB and the local authorities in order to create this app system.

Adam Bagul,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Adam-Bagul-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,1st,History of Public Policy and Law,,,"I am running to be an on-campus senator with the 71st senate for a wide variety of reasons.
Civic service is an incredibly powerful idea and practice, it improves the quality of the
communities and people that are lucky enough to enjoy it. Service is a significant ideal that I
foresee continuing to drive me in my life and one that I will hold dear. However, it is only
worthwhile if there are people and ideas that are worth serving. I am so grateful to find myself
at UCSB where there are no shortages of people and ideas to advocate for and service roles in
which to do so. AS Senate is a wonderful place to work through both of those needs, being
privileged enough to serve by advocating for those students and issues that deserve it.
Additionally, I have an innate passion for leadership. I love being a part of something bigger
than myself, even more so being more involved and holding responsibilities that maintaining a
leadership position carries. Leaving high school I joined the United States Marine Corps, in
basic training I felt compelled to go beyond expectations and I soon found myself in a squad
leader billet. I held that billet until graduation and earned a meritorious promotion. This was
the beginning of understanding and realizing my passion for leadership. I still currently hold a
leadership billet in the Marines and deeply enjoy leading my marines as well as mentoring,
caring for, and holding them accountable. When I arrived at UCSB I found myself at an
informational meeting regarding Hall Council. Go big or go home, right? I ran for Hall Council
President and have been fortunate enough to win and serve during the 2019 - 2020 school year.
I have found that while student leadership is much different than leadership in the Marine
Corps, my enthusiasm for it remains all the same. I want to continue to chase my passion for
leadership and what better way than to increase the scope and be a part of a group of
representatives for all UCSB students. The amount of reasons I have for running for senate
goes on and on and include but are certainly not limited to, meeting more of my peers at
UCSB, challenging myself in both running and maintaining the senate position, and the
personal and professional development that will occur no matter the result of elections.","In my role as San Rafael Hall Council President I have been involved with two organizations
that while similar in function, prepared me for a position as an on-campus senator in different
yet overlapping ways. As San Rafael Hall Council President I worked closely with the
Residential Housing Association, or RHA, and San Rafael’s very own Hall Council. In
working with RHA I learned the basics of being in a legislative body, such as parliamentary
procedure or parli pro. Working and volunteering on different committees within RHA aided
me in gaining more experience with collaboration with other students on non-academic
projects and learning more about UCSB and life on campus in general. Attending weekly
coordinating board meetings within RHA exposed me to many different student organizations
and the events they host that make UCSB such an exciting community to participate in. Hall
Council on the other hand gave me experience holding a more administrative role in a student
government setting, such as being responsible for holding weekly executive and coordinating
board meetings and office hours. Both RHA and my Hall Council have prepared me to be an
on-campus senator in teaching me the issues that are common in residence halls and with on
campus students as well as many of the resources that are available to alleviate or move
forward with said issues.","Of my platform the three most important issues to me are resolving the inefficiency regarding
veterans’ benefits, urging the university to create more composting bins, and subsidizing /
lowering the cost of on campus parking. Regarding the first, I would begin researching further
into the details and deficiencies in the process that is leading to the hold up. During these early
stages I will likely find a student sponsor, likely another student veteran. The resolution itself
would roughly be along the lines of, “Whereas it is the responsibility of UCSB to certify
necessary documents in a timely manner, and; this has not been the case in recent years.
Therefore let it be resolved by the Associated Students in the Legislative Council assembled:
That the student body of the University of California, Santa Barbara strongly urges the
University to hire the necessary additional staff / correct the deficiencies and hold those
responsible for those delays accountable”. The second bill being related to additional compost
bins on campus would also begin with research and collaboration with related organizations
and departments at UCSB. The resolution itself would likely be one of support: “Whereas,
UCSB has committed itself to striving towards being zero waste, and compost bins are an
effective way to further this effort, and campus presently does not compost bins close to many
on campus residence halls. Therefore let it be resolved by the Associated Students in the
Legislative Council assembled: That the student body of UCSB supports the proposed plan to
create more composting bins on campus”. The third resolution would start no different than the
other two, with research and talking with related departments namely the Transportation and

Parking Services. This resolution / bill is harder to speculate on details because there are many
unknowns that will be answered with further research but if the UCSB is unwilling to negotiate
lowering parking permit prices then a conversation will ensue both within AS and with myself
and RHA to see if our organizations could subsidize a realistic amount of the cost. All of these
bills are rather difficult to “detail” because the ideas have multiple paths that have yet to be
revealed.","My platform consists of four main points, which I will lay out in a nonspecific order. I aim to
diminish parking costs while serving in AS Senate, through collaboration with the Office of
Transportation and Parking Services and RHA. This will most likely start through contacting the
Office of Transportation & Parking Services and Parking Rate Payers Board to inquire as to why
parking is priced as it currently stands and other relevant details. With updated and more specific
information I as well as other interested senators will most likely formulate the next course of
action whether it be trying to foster collaboration between AS and RHA to help subsidize
parking costs or putting heavy pressure on the university to lower these costs. Pushing for access
of the 200 free prints that students are allotted to be extended to the ResNet Printers in the
Residence Halls can be accomplished through speaking with the Housing Department and
Gaucho Print. Through entering a dialogue with both of these entities, we can better understand
why ResNet Printers are not included in this resource and take steps to try and include them.
Again reaching out to RHA for support in this matter would be incredibly helpful and only help
the chances of this idea becoming a reality. Urging UCSB to add more compost bins on campus
in order to help our campus further responsible environmental practices. This piece of platform
will require coming into contact and working with many departments at UCSB such as Facilities,
Sustainability, student and university organizations focused around environmental sustainability /
composting, and within AS itself with the office of the EVPLA and interested senators. Like
most issues in order to effectively take on this challenge information regarding the problem itself
and the roadmap to achieve the desired endstate is crucial to its success. Facilities and
Sustainability will yield information regarding how we can set up and begin the process, relying
on the other environmental organizations for help and support. Last but certainly not least, an
essential part of my platform would be advocating for student veterans by putting pressure on
university administration to hire the necessary staff and implement necessary changes so that
student veterans never get their benefits late again. I plan on learning more specifics regarding
the problem through talking to the SVO, other student veterans, and going through the process
myself. After learning more about where the deficiencies in the process occur, pressure and

urging UCSB to correct the problem will be more effective and better directed whether it be
through a bill, resolution, petition, changes made in operations and procedures, etc.","There are a multitude of organizations that I aim to collaborate with within my term as senator,
many directly pertaining to the issues and pieces of my platform that intensely hold my
attention. For example I hope to work with the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board, the
California Student Sustainability Coalition, The IV Compost Collective run by IVCSD, UCSB
Sustainability / Student E-Coalition, Zero Waste Committee, and other similar organizations.
Through working with these organizations I hope that we can further awareness, gain wide
support in favor of, and ultimately push UCSB to place more compost bins on campus. Time
and time again I have seen compostable food waste mismanaged by either being placed in the
garbage or left in the grass all over UCSB. Our university should continue striving to be zero
waste and investing in more compostable bins is a significant step towards that goal. Another
group of organizations that I would like to collaborate with are the Office of Transportation
and Parking and RHA. I believe that On-Campus students pay far too much for university
parking spots and through opening a dialogue / working with these entities change can be made
to lower or further subsidize parking costs. Additionally, a huge personally important issue that
I hope to resolve is the tardiness of tuition assistance that many student veterans are entitled to
and depend upon. I will be seeking advice, collaboration, and assistance with the Student
Veteran Organization, Military Family Organization, and Veteran Resource Center to make
sure this problem is resolved and does not persist.","It is clearly a difficult time for all UCSB students operating remotely and not being able to
enjoy the school that we hold so dear. Aside from not being in Isla Vista, seeing your friends,
and feeling normal these circumstances make access to TAs, professors, and on campus
resources more difficult and in some cases non-existent. The same applies to AS Senators,
however it is easy and more importantly senators’ responsibility to make themselves more
easily available if online courses continue through summer and fall quarter. Very similar to
quality TAs and professors, I would be open to hosting office hours weekly through Zoom for
any UCSB students that would prefer that form of communication. I would also be incredibly
vigilant with my school email and would respond to emails promptly. In addition to Zoom
office hours and reaching out through email, I plan on being incredibly present on my Senator

Facebook page and all social media. I think the use of social media and especially a Senator
Facebook page may offer a more approachable and personable way to get in contact with
constituents. In these unprecedented times of isolation, communication is key and as a senator I
do not plan on forgetting that whether I am on-campus or not as I greatly look forward to
speaking with fellow UCSB students.","I am the best candidate for the on-campus senate position because of my leadership experience
and determined hardworking nature. My time in RHA and Hall Council have taught me many of
the problems that are common in on-campus living. RHA and Hall Council have also introduced
me to many resources that are available to help on-campus students. An important part of being a
leader is being able to maintain a cool and level head in high stress situations, a skill that I am
very familiar with as I have and continue to lead marines during dynamic live fire exercises.
Situations like the one we are facing together all over the world highlights the need for level
headed leaders who will not get overwhelmed when stakes are high. I have proven to my
marines, my fellow RHA members, Hall Council members and more importantly myself that I
am an effective leader and I will continue to be as a senator. My mother once told me if you’re
not giving something one hundred percent, then why do it? When I set myself to a goal or
commitment I make sure that I give it my full effort. I am the best candidate for the position
because I am capable of filling the role more effectively than other candidates and if elected I
will put maximum effort in being the best senator I can be.","Other. I’m independent, I really don’t subscribe to solely left or right wing points of view.
Additionally, I do not allow my political beliefs affect my judgement when working in a
representative role, I will be focused on the opinions of my constituents rather than my own.","Good. As a first year that is very new into involvement with AS, as far as I can tell they’ve

done well. I was very pleased to hear about the resolution regarding roll over swipes in the
dining commons which is a change that is overdue. Additionally I have not heard any major
scandals or deficiencies in AS Senate this year so I do not have any negative judgement to
pass. However, on the other side of not hearing much about AS, it seems that the Senate and
AS in general needs to put a greater focus on awareness into current AS events and resolutions
/ bills. Many students, myself included, are not well informed on AS’s work and that in of
itself is a problem as they have a responsibility to effectively communicate their progress.","OTHER. I hope to learn more during my time as a senator so I can pass more informed
judgement if the vote comes up once again.","No. While every student, myself included, would be ecstatic to no longer pay tuition I do
not believe that it is feasible. Tuition accounts for an incredibly large portion of the
University’s income and is responsible for funding the bulk of virtually everything at UCSB.
Additionally I do not foresee California miraculously volunteering to fund all the UC’s out of
nowhere. I do believe that the UC has the means to significantly lower tuition and should do
so. Tuition-free attendance would be preferred, but it is not realistic at this time. There needs to
be a balance between too expensive and free, and unfortunately it is clear that it is presently
heavily skewed toward the former.","I am aware that the University’s Counseling and Psychological Services or “CAPS” is a very
well known and advertised resource on campus. CAPS is said to offer professional counselors
and therapists as well as help from other students called “mental health peers”. While the staff
and all the resources at CAPS are incredibly appreciated by the students of UCSB it is clear

that CAPS is failing to serve the needs of UCSB students in many respects. There is a dire
shortage in staff at CAPS, specifically licensed counselors and therapists, contributing to
incredibly long wait times. The shortage in therapists and counselors is also demonstrated in
CAPS’s outsourcing of some service to Acacia Counseling and Wellness. Outsourcing some
service is better than inaction and adding to the already extensive waitlist that students must
contend with, but with the resources that UCSB holds CAPS should be better equipped to
handle students’ needs. Additionally, roughly over 12 percent of the student population at UC
Santa Barbara are international students, the majority of them from China. Keeping UCSB’s
large Chinese student population one would think that there would be a counselor or therapist
that can help these students in Mandarin or Cantonese. Unfortunately this is not the case, this
essential resource is less accessible to a huge segment of our student body, who are away from
home in a country much different from their own with all the added academic stress that any
college student faces. Subsequently, I believe that action needs to be taken to resolve this
deficiency.","UC Santa Barbara’s response to the multiple reports of sexual assault occuring on fraternity
property during the 2019 fall quarter could have been better, specifically in timing. The rape at
the Sigma Pi house took place in early October. The University first responded to the reports of
the incidents by using the timely warning system, emailing all students on October 17th. In this
email they informed students that two incidents of sexual assault took place with a minor
description giving some details, following safety tips and resources. This email was sent far too
late, there is no reason why this email was received by students over a week and a half later.
The next day the IFC announced that they had put a 5 day moratorium on all fraternity social
activities. This decision also came too late and did not go far enough. They later changed the
moratorium to be indefinitely which I believe was the right call. On October 28, the university
sent out another timely warning email again giving a brief description, a description of the
suspect, and revealing that it had taken place at Sigma Pi. This is also far too late for a follow
up email to be sent especially if it is releasing pertinent information that may have been
necessary to include in the first email. UCSB later held a forum in November to address
students’ concerns. I believe this is also far too late and the university’s general focus on
women defending themselves rather than the root cause is concerning as well. Simply put I
think UCSB took most of the right steps, all extremely late making it lose much of its
effectiveness.","I do not believe that Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses.
As it stands Title IX itself is a sound and solid law in terms of setting the framework of
provisions and directives to work through cases of sexual assault, however the most important
part of its effectiveness is enforcement and implementation. Objectively, the enforcement of
Title IX in regards to the intensity of universities across the country in their response has been
drawn back in the transition between the Obama to Trump administration. This change is
propagated significantly in part by Department of Education Secretary Betsy Devos. It is
difficult to quantify the change in response from the change in administration, but nevertheless
it is still present. I strongly believe that it is not a smart or moral decision to scale back
intensity of sexual violence investigations or reprecussions in any case. The system that Title
IX has put into place can also put stress on survivors or victims of sexual assault who may not
want to move forward legally and disclose the details of their assault. In these cases CARE
works as a vital supplement to the system in place, allowing victims to work through emotional
trauma without disclosing information to mandated reporters who are required to come forward
to law enforcement.","While I do believe that there is always progress to be made and concerns that need to be
addressed, I do believe that at a fundamental level UCSB is serving historically
underrepresented groups. These groups include minority communities ranging from Latinx,
Black, Korean, Chinese, Middle Eastern and many more, to the LGBTQ+ community. The
administration and the community strongly supports these groups as seen through the support
given to organizations such as Black Student Union, Korean-American Student Association,
Queer Student Union, Vietnamese Student Association and many more. In my time in
Residential Housing Association, I’ve seen many different minority organizations come
through to ask for support or funding, the vast majority receive the entirety of their funding
requests and those who do not receive full funding usually receive partial funding. Apart from
student lead organizations the school’s own resources such as the Black Resource Center, The

Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, El Centro, and the Multi-Cultural Center
shows the University’s commitment to these historically underrepresented communities. The
progress and efforts that the university has made are not the end all be all to action that can be
taken. I believe that many underrepresented communities have needs that aren’t being
addressed and I want to champion that.","If elected to serve on Senate, my first bill or resolution that I would plan to author would
definitely concern student veterans. It is not an issue that is widely known or talked about on
campus, regardless it is still present. UCSB has not been processing Veteran’s benefits on time
leaving student veterans with much added stress affecting them academically, emotionally, and
most of all financially. Most people are aware that veterans usually attend university for free
because of earned benefits through their service, and this generally is the case if they choose to
use their benefits. However, through talking to other student veterans who have been at UCSB
longer than I have I have found out that the UCSB does not have enough staff to certify
documents in order to process benefits. Benefits are being processed late for many student
veterans leaving them to pay high unexpected costs until financial aid comes in, one student
veteran even having to take out a personal loan to cover tuition in the meantime. Needless to
say, my first resolution would be interested in hiring the necessary staff to certify VA benefits
and pushing the administration to hold those failing to do so accountable. As it is time sensitive
and a recurring problem that veterans should not have to meet friction with.","When I first began writing my response to this question I began describing holding an event at
least once a quarter, similar in nature to a social but its primary focus being to bridge the gap
between students and AS. I detailed that the meetings could start with a brief overview on past
ongoing, and future actions in AS Senate as well as giving general information regarding all
the opportunities and resources in AS, later giving time for students to meet with senators and
express ideas, concerns, and observations. These events already exist, they are called forums
and they are required by legal code in AS. I am glad that this concept is a reality, however how
effective can forums be if they are not well known or advertised. In order to mitigate the
feelings of inaccessibility towards Associated Students I aim to focus energy and effort to raise
awareness regarding forums and improve them further by looking into how they currently

function. A system in which senators can inform and involve the general student body and also
receive feedback and ideas from their constituency is only effective if there are students who
are aware of this resource and participate in using it.","I believe that the next UC President should embody what the University of California should
stand for: the education and wellbeing of students, staff, and community instead of corporate
interests. It seems more and more that universities across the country are shifting their concern
for profit instead of their purpose, students, and faculty. The next UC President should make it
a priority to move the UC in the opposite direction, away from this shameful trend. President
Napolitano’s successor should immediately be making an effort to lower tuition AND taking
steps to secure more resources for all UC campuses. A concrete example of this may include
but certainly is not limited to, working to reimburse part of students' 2020 Spring Quarter
tuition as online classes pale in comparison to the value of in person classes and the resources
being physically present on campus includes. President Napolitano’s successor should also
educate themselves on the 2020 Winter Quarter COLA strikes. Through becoming further
informed on the details of the situation, I hope that they will come to understand that graduate
students are a clearly essential component to our system and deserve a livable wage that is
appropriate compared to local living costs. COLA being a subject in which it seems President
Janet Napolitano has fallen short, it would seem necessary that her successor should correct
this situation.",,,,,,,

to be done. Joining Campus United has exposed me to so many people, including the
AS President Alison Sir, Internal Vice President Alli Adam, and so many more who do
everything they can to make UCSB the best it can be. Being someone who has no
experience in UCSB’s student government felt like a disadvantage at first, but I
quickly came to realize the outside perspective it gives me. As someone who spent this
year not only living on campus but also working within my residence hall, I gained a
lot of knowledge on how these halls are run as well as what we can do to provide for
students. Along with this, there are so many resources available to students that they
just are not aware of that I want to help bring into the light to support small
organizations as well as students in need. One of the most important things to me is
making sure students always feel represented; an effective government is one that
gives everyone within it a chance to voice themselves, even if that be through a
representative. I want to be a part of the positive change we see on this campus and I
want to represent our student body as well as I can.\","Throughout my first year, I was very active in my residence hall’s Hall Council. We
met every week and discussed upcoming events, funding, and what we could do to
make our residence hall great for everyone. As a floor representative, I was able to
work alongside other floor reps and decide on necessary funding for different events.
One of the key aspects we would always look at is if the event is inclusive to as many
people as possible, and how we could make it more inclusive. Those conversations
really showed me how easy it is to make sure everyone feels like they can be involved
within their community, and that was evident even in the events my committee and I
held throughout the year. Along with this, I am involved in UCSB’s Army ROTC
program. This program has taught me so much about leadership and teamwork; having

to work with all kinds of people to solve problems and make sure everyone is involved
actively is crucial in making sure plans run as smoothly as possible. I believe these
skills translate directly into a senator position where I would likewise be having to
consider many people in every decision I make. Communication is vital between
leaders and the people they represent to ensure that everyone has a voice as we move
forward together and I believe that through these types of involvements, I have been
able to learn how to do just that.",NO ANSWER,"My platform, as I am running for On-Campus Senate, will be centered around the students that
are living in residence halls. The vast majority of these students are freshmen with little to no
knowledge about how campus life works and the resources available to them. In office, I would
be creating ways to keep as many students informed as possible about how our school works,
whether that be through mass emails, social media platforms, or even fliers around the school.
Along with this, I would also be working with some second year students living in residence
halls such as San Rafael and Manzanita Village, doing my best to ensure that these students feel
just as involved as anyone else. One of the greatest things I have learned during my short time
working with Campus United is just how many resources that our school has to offer. As a
freshman, I was never exposed to many of the committees and organizations dedicated to student
life at UCSB and I would do my best to spread that type of information to students. These groups
include but are not limited to mental health facilities and organizations dedicated to food supply
for students in need. In growing the amount of people these groups impact, I would also be sure
to keep in contact to make sure they are always funded properly and given enough to provide and
function efficiently.","One of the biggest focuses of my campaign is ensuring proper mental health care for all students.

Organizations such as UCSB’s Mental Health Taskforce have already done so much for our
students and I would continue our work with them as well as the Public and Mental Health
Commission to see that we are continuing to push for the best resources we can offer. I often talk
about how important it is to be as transparent with students as possible. We often feel like our
campus is so large that there is no way to keep track of what is going on, but I believe especially
in these confusing times that it is not only possible but crucial that we keep everyone informed
on the ways we are moving forward. This can be done in so many methods ranging from online
groups to apps like Wildfire, but I know I could work with UCSB’s Publications organization
and even the Media Center to continue pushing information about events as well as changes and
important news to all students. Of course, there are so many ways to relay this information
already, but students often end up lost between countless emails, websites, and posts. There are
multiple news sources such as the Daily Nexus that are dedicated to keeping students informed
about issues campus wide that they may be interested in, and these are resources that I want
students on campus to utilize to ensure that there is as much transparency throughout the student
body and administration as possible.","Although this shift into online courses has made connection very difficult, I believe that if we
understand how to work through it together, we can make the best of it. Social media platforms
and other methods of communication such as messaging apps have made it easier to stay
connected than ever before and I believe it is absolutely vital to continue utilizing this
technology moving forward, regardless of if we are in-person or online. That being said, because
this online transition has been so drastic for all students, I have noticed people coming together
through all platforms such as Instagram trends or Facebook groups, just proving that we are all in
this together somehow. If necessary, I would be completely open to online communication and I
would even encourage some sort of forum for students to contact their representatives directly so
there will always be that active communication that allows students to be as involved in their
student body as they can be. We can even open some type of dropbox where students with
concerns can drop in suggestions for representatives to consider. Ideas like “office hours” for
student body representatives can be driven the same way professors and TAs have been keeping
themselves open for certain times throughout the week via email or even Zoom calls. This allows
for those students to contact their representatives with concerns and questions in real time, and it
is crucial that we continue to push for voices in the student body to be heard.","I would be the best candidate for this position because I believe in the power of student voice.
Throughout high school, I was in many leadership positions such as president of multiple clubs
and even the track and field team captain for two years. In that time, I dealt with many situations
where the people who looked up to me as a leader were not motivated to move forward and from
those experiences, I learned how to push through hardships as a team. During my time here at
UCSB, I took it upon myself to be a floor representative for San Rafael’s hall council where I
represented the residents on my floor when discussing events and money spent in our residence
hall. This gave me some insight on how to properly represent a group of people, always making
sure to talk to some residents beforehand to get opinions on ideas as well as keeping everyone
updated through posters and Groupme messages about upcoming events. I have always felt that
transparency is crucial to get things done and properly represent people, and that is a value I will
continue to uphold when in office. One of the most important lessons that I carry with me to this
day is that everyone has such a unique perspective on the world that shapes the way they react to
problems, so you can never take someone’s ideas for granted. In that sense, I believe I have a
very open mind and I will always be willing to hear the suggestions and requests of my
colleagues as well as constituents when it comes to passing bills or making decisions.","Independent, I think it’s important to look at
individual policies and solutions rather than identifying blindly with any party outlook
on politics.",Very Good,"No: This topic is not one I know enough to
express a fully formed opinion about. I will always advocate for human rights, and I
definitely would love to see support from organizations such as our university in
efforts to relieve those in impoverished countries. However, without more personal
research on the topic, I think it is unfair of me to express any perspective, and I would
definitely be open to speaking more on this issue once it becomes one I am more
familiarized with.","No: Although it is essential to have some resources to help
students afford their education as well as enforcements to ensure that universities are not
scamming students and making education inaccessible to certain groups, there is countless staff
within our campus that deserve an adequate paycheck for their hard work. From T.A’s to
janitorial services, there are people in our system we cannot overlook. Along with this, there are
also vital resources that are provided to students that we can expand through AS efforts and

committee resolutions that would only go to further benefit students which would not exist
without tuition costs.","As an incoming freshman, I remember being constantly preached to about the impressive
extent to the mental health services provided at UCSB. However even as a freshman, there
have been instances where I have felt the need to take advantage of these so-called resources
where I was given a wait time estimated by the months. My experience is not surprising to
many students, I have talked with countless people (including but not limited to my own
friends) who have dealt with this same struggle of needing the resources that were presented
as far more functioning than they really are. Just the idea that there are two months worth of
students that are desperately seeking mental health services at any given time on our campus
should not sit well with anyone. One of the problems seems to be that students just do not
know all of the programs available for them. UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force continues
working directly to bridge the gap between mental health resources and the student body,
including a new website that helps students navigate support systems that are available to
them in a way that makes it easier to get the help they need. We need more coverage on these
systems to reach more students who may need the help but are unable to find it because it
otherwise results in an overflow of people to one program that may not even have what they
are seeking. While I see on-campus resources such as mental health events coordinated in
residence halls, these events do not reach out to the vast majority of university students who
need more than a face mask and a movie night. It is vital that we continue to show how many
students care about each other as well as themselves in the area of mental health, and we
must continue to emphasize that mental health is just as important as physical health. As an
AS Senator, I would work closely with groups like UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force to
ensure that we continue to improve the services we can provide to all students.","In a situation like that, it is obviously going to be hard for the university to go through all
evidence and processes necessary while making sure the students feel like there is any effort
being made. I am a strong advocate for constant transparency and there is no reason that we
should not be kept in the loop in a situation that could be dangerous as well as concerning for
many if not all students. There is only so much we can do to stop individual actions, but
seeing sexual assault become such a pattern on university campuses is alarming and cannot
go unaddressed. I have had to take the same online courses given to all students regarding
sexual assault and I have seen the ways to be an active bystander, but all these “solutions” do
is teach how to stop the crime in action. I do not believe these methods are preventative
enough and I think there is so much more we can do than wait until it is too late. I would like
to advocate and continue to support the work that the UCSB Safer Social Events Task Force
has done because we need more emphasis on reformative methods that change the way we
stop sexual assault on our campus.","Title IX is interesting because it is fundamentally a good idea as it prioritizes equal access
to education regardless of gender. However, its recent implementation in California
universities is very controversial. Because this is such a young topic that I know so little
about, I do not want to falsely speak on the account, but from the research I have done
thus far, I do not believe Title IX adequately addresses sexual assault on campus because
it forces the victim to relive their experience in front of many others in a courtroom.
While I do believe it is important that a statement be made in order to emphasize a fair
trial, this experience is not only traumatizing for the victim, it also pushes so many into
silence. Everyone in a situation where they are sexually assaulted wants to speak up, but
requiring them to speak in such an uncomfortable setting forces so many people to just let
it go. This not only fails to bring justice to students, it perpetuates the idea for the
assaulter that they can get away with anything, putting more students at risk.","As lucky as I have been to attend such a richly diverse and accepting campus, I believe
there is always work to be done when it comes to representation. Every week I am sent

emails and I look around campus to see flyers about events that not only serve to
represent different groups, but also many that involve interests and hobbies that bring
people of all different groups together. From my own experience, the best organizations
are the ones that are not the “most accepting,” but the ones that look towards the
character of a person rather than focusing on their born traits. While it is vital that we
continue to represent all groups and ensure diversity is never overlooked, it is also
important that we do not stop there and we continue to support organizations that are
inclusive to interests and the development of relationships that dive deeper than the
surface to build a more connected campus.","I will never stop advocating for the improvement if not reformation of our school’s mental
health care facilities. UCSB takes student’s mental health very much into account; I have
seen residence halls, professors, and even the chancellor address topics involving students’
mental health in the past. However, it is a different story talking to everyday students. I
have spoken with many people, including both friends and strangers throughout campus,
to see what common opinions are surrounding UCSB’s mental health services and the
answers are almost always the same; inadequate. Of course, this campus is known and
often brags about its advanced resources, but students do not feel they have proper access
to mental health care, regardless of how educated they are on the amount of resources we
have to provide. I firmly believe that mental health is just as important as physical health
and it is concerning to me that in a university where students are constantly under severe
pressure and stress, they feel that they are not given adequate access to basic healthcare.
We must approach a reformative bill that looks at mental health with that exact
perspective-- that it is just as important as physical well-being. I think if we were to invest
more attention and funds into our existing programs, it is completely possible to expand
them and to ensure that more students are cared for as efficiently as possible. Luckily,
through my short time with Campus United, I have already had multiple personal
conversations with leaders who are dedicated to this same issue. Even our current AS
President, Alison Sir, has done so much including organizing a Mental Health Town Hall
to initiate a broader conversation about how we work through mental health issues as a
community. These are the types of efforts I would continue to support and help grow in
office.","Social media has become such an amazing outlet of relaying information to students.
However, just as well as it is a resource, it can also be seen as a threat to our ability to
decipher between true and false information. There are countless forums such as
Facebook where a great majority of students can join groups that share information
that may be important for others to know. I am a part of many of these groups,
including the Wildfire app that gives students the run-down on events that concern
them in real time. It is crucial that we continue using these forums because students
do not have the time to sit around and try to figure out what is going on and how it
will affect them. In recent events, Chancellor Yang constantly sent emails regarding
how to move forward and the effects of the recent virus on student life and classes in
the future. This consistent transparency not only keeps students in the loop, it lets
them know that their school cares about them and the quality of their education. It is
important that we keep all students informed about how things around campus are
working and what resources they have/what may affect them in the future, and I
would push for more of this to be done through social media so students have
constant access to that information in their hands.","I think one of the biggest concerns students have is transparency with how their tuition is
being used to make their campus as efficient and beneficial as it can be. We always see a
new building being built on campus or some form of construction that will not affect most
students’ day-to-day lives. Truth be told, these projects serve the university more than they
do the students. Everyone attending UCSB can name at least one area in which we can
improve, a very large one being fixing the bike paths. This suggests that there is a lot we can
do in developing resources that students can directly see helping them. Along with this, we
prioritize our sustainability efforts greatly, but there is so much more work to be done. The
next UC President definitely needs to continue the efforts to make the UCs as climate
friendly as possible as we aim to be a zero emission campus. These ideas all seem to tie in
together; it is crucial that students understand where their tuition is going and how it is
helping them as they pursue higher education so they can continue to work with AS leaders
and their own committees in advocating for causes and funds that they feel are important.
The next UC President should continue to work directly with students across UC campuses

to hear their concerns and help fund and support their efforts to find resolutions. We need a
president who is as eager to make positive change the same way I see students across
campuses working to see progress.",,,,,,,
Yehuda Jian,max,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yehuda-Jian-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,"He, Him, His",2nd,Philosophy,,,"I am running for senate because I have a passion for changing my community for the better. I
love the people and atmosphere at UCSB and know that I can make the experience for future
students even better. As the Director of Legislative Accountability this year, I have connected
BCUs to their assigned Senators, handled any miscommunications or complaints about the
assignments, created a more modern and organized accountability system for both BCUs and
Senators by moving it from paper to digital, and I sat on the TPS/ratepayers board as the liaison
from the office of the IVP.  From early on I was drawn to student leadership and aside from my
role in AS, I’m on the Executive Boards of both Chabad and SSI. Even outside of my official
leadership positions, I have taken the initiative to lobby AS members and administrators alike to
advocate for the needs of the communities I am a part of. I was one of the main student voices
that supported the current Kosher/Halal food program and I continue to push for a more
permanent and steady solution with the creation of an entirely Kosher/Halal dining hall.",See above.,"The first bill I would introduce is a bill that would use the excess fees from students that AS
doesn’t use to reduce the overall cost of school through either a partial refund of whatever
wasn’t used, setting up a fund to be used for need based financial aid, or using the money to
subsidize cheaper textbooks. I would work with Finance and Business along with multiple facets
of the administration to make this a sustainable reality so that students get more from the
hundreds of dollars they pay to AS each year. The second would be a resolution calling for
better academic accommodations for religious students. There is no school policy about
religious accommodations other than the obligation to move a final. Whether it’s midterms,
quizzes homeworks or even attendance, the decision is up to the professor and that means that
religious students will never know if they can rely on accommodations or not. This resolution will
show religious students that someone is in their corner and I will work with the administration,
Hillel, MSA and various other religious orgs to make the demands of this resolution a reality.
The third thing I would pass would be a bill to allocate funding for the implementation of the
Blue-Light system and put together a task force to get it done. I will work with administration,
IVTU, IVCSD and the EVPLA to put together this task force and get the job done. It has been
way too long since the implementation of the first Blue-Lights on campus and I think it is about
time IV started feeling safer at night.","The most important parts of my platform and how I plan to achieve them are detailed above.
I also plan to work with the SRB, Library and UCEN to implement more AS charging stations so
that when midterms or finals come around, these spaces are more capable of dealing with the
increase in students spending a lot of time there. My final platform is to work with IVTU, IVCSD
and the EVPLA to get more street lighting in Isla Vista and build on the work that has already
been started in years passed.","I have detailed above who I will be working with for each part of my platform and will be open
to working with and hearing from any org or entity not already listed. I am here to give a voice to
my constituents and am happy to work with any org or entity that helps me do that.","I will hold weekly zoom office hours that will be posted on my Senate Facebook page and will
be open to making appointments outside of those office hours. I will also be available through
email, facebook messenger or whatever platform of communication works best with the student.
I plan to check all these forms of communication by the end of each day and respond to them as
soon as i read them or as soon as I have an answer. If for whatever reason a student cannot
find a time to actually meet with me, I will create a google form that will be posted on my Senate
Facebook page with a comments box that I will use to get feedback from students and still have
a way to listen to what they need to talk to me about. All of my personal social media account
information will also be made available along with my phone number, I understand the
importance of being available to my constituents and am prepared to go the extra mile to do so.","After spending a year in AS I have a clear idea of what is going well and what needs
improvement. I have specific ideas and plans on how to go about making these changes. I am
very excited to work with other senators who want to make change like I do and look forward to
working with Senators with different opinions to find a middleground where everyone benefits. I
have experience directly consulting Legal Code at the request of the IVP and I’m familiar with
the procedures of Senate meetings so I can hit the ground running once I get elected and start
getting things done immediately. I have experience working with AS entities and the
administration and have made vital connections with those people that will help me achieve my
goals. I am very open to new ideas and will advocate for any student who comes to me with a
voice that needs to be heard. I care about our campus and will do everything in my power to
make it better.","Centrist, I have some opinions that are to the left and some to the right but they average out
in the middle.","Very Good, as the Director of Legislative Accountability, I have had the unique opportunity to
watch senators work and I witnessed a group that is overall very dedicated to the student body
and who really care about the important issues.","Divestment is connected to an extremely controversial issue with valid claims on both sides.
I personally am against Divestment and am pro-Israel. I would like to clarify however, that this
does not mean I don’t recognize the struggle of the palestinian people. I believe that the true
path to a peaceful resolution of the conflict is by building bridges between the communities not
by building walls, whether they be physical or financial. I don’t approve of most of the things the
Israeli government does or has done in the past, but one could say that about many countries
and yet I don’t see a reason to divest from companies that do business with those countries. As
a proud member of the Jewish community I believe that the Divestment resolution is
Anti-Semitic and the only proof needed for that is the majority of the Jewish community agreeing
that it is.","Yes, I believe that all higher education should be free but I would say that the best way to
get there is gradually with a good plan that doesn't leave teachers underpaid and resources and
facilities underfunded. UCSB was founded with the idea it would be free. I think that that is the
right way to go but just cutting tuition immediately presents too many problems. The best path in
my opinion is to gradually lower tuition over a period of time to allow the necessary adjustments
to be made.","From my personal experience, I think that the types of services available are adequate but
they do not have enough locations. Students should be able to easily fit a visit to CAPS into
their schedules, and if they spend most of their time around the Chem Building or Physical
Sciences, that can be quite difficult. The staff I have encountered at CAPS have always been
respectful, understanding and helpful. When I am elected, if any of my constituents expressed a
desire to fix the Mental Health system or make it better, I would not hesitate to do everything in
my power to do so. Mental Health is just as, if not more important than Physical Health,
especially to a student. It is the responsibility of any university to give their students the best
chance to succeed and that goes hand in hand with making sure all of their students can access
whatever resources are necessary to stay healthy, mentally and physically. For example, the
University could partner with Acacia to build a system where students who can’t get a CAPS
counselor, are helped without having to do any extra work.","The university did not handle the situation with the fraternities well at all. Sexual Harrasment
and Sexual Assault are not matters that should be taken lightly. After the allegations made in
Fall Quarter, I would expect those Frats to be kicked off of campus. Simply putting Frats on
social probation for the remainder of a quarter that was already almost over is not nearly
enough. Frats have to take real responsibility for what happened. I think they should have been
required to have some sort of real education on what sexual harassment or assault are and how
to actively prevent them. When the school fails to respond properly to something like this, it
sends a message to the student body that the school doesn’t care. This message is not only a
sad one but an unacceptable one. If the school required Green Dot training for all OSL groups
including Greek Life, I think it would be a good indicator that the administration cares and is
working to create a safer environment.","I think that Title IX is not strict enough on universities. Just mandating a system of report is
nice, but not enough. Schools should be forced to put policies in place that are in line with the
legal repercussions of sexual harrassment or sexual assault. The university should not be given
the opportunity to kick the can down the road and hope someone else does the job. People
need to be helped as soon as these things happen and not at the leisure of some bureaucracy.
For too long the voices of people who have been harassed or assaulted have been silenced for
no better reason than “They were asking for it dressed like that” or “they should have manned
up and said no”. We can no longer allow this bigotry to exist and when I am elected senator, I
will fight to eliminate it.","As someone from a religious background, I can say that while UCSB has some great
resources for underrepresented groups, it definitely could use some more work. For the
Religious Community specifically, there are very few ways that the University accommodates
our holidays and traditions. I once was forced to drop a class I needed for my major just
because the department refused to give me the accommodations I needed to have an equal
playing field with the rest of the class. When I asked the department head why they refused to
accomodate me they said that there was actually no policy that pertained to my situation and
that it was above their power to do anything about. In the end it took too long to set up a
meeting with the person who could have helped me and I was forced to request a late drop to
avoid the low grade I would have gotten from missing the first three weeks of the quarter. When
I am elected one of my first orders of business will be to set this right and work with the
administration to create real and sensible policies that take into account the needs of religious
students, and any other underrepresented groups who have to work harder to keep up just
because of their background.","The first bill I plan to author is a bill that will put money back in the hands of students. For
years AS entities have been given budgets that are larger than what they actually spend, and
the extra just goes into a rollover budget that they can use next year. All that does however, is
create even more extra money sitting around doing nothing. I plan to change that. I will write a
bill that puts any excess funds at the end of the year back in the hands of students. This would
lower the overall cost of student fees by way of reimbursement. This money could also be used
to lower the price of textbooks or create a scholarship program for students in financial need.
AS gets around 14 million dollars a year to work with, if even 5 percent of that were to be given
back to students  it would free up $700,000 to give back to students. Imagine a UCSB where
that 600 dollars a year you pay actually saves you 600 dollars in textbooks, that's the UCSB I
want to create.","When I was a freshman I wanted to get involved in student government but I couldn’t even
find the name Associated Students, let alone the room it was in. The Pearman fellowship is a
great way to get involved with Associated Students and the number of fellows it yielded was
much higher this past year than years past, but I think it can get much bigger and more
accessible. When I am elected, I will work with the Office of Admissions and the Creative Media
Unit to get the word out to students before they even start their first quarter at UCSB. As the
Director of Legislative Accountability, I know first hand what it’s like to try and keep the Senate
accountable. In my position in AS I have already created a digital system of accountability to
replace the extremely out of date one which was still on paper. When I am a Senator I will write
legislation to get updates on the  senate agenda, senate office hours, senate meeting times and
other information posted not just on the senate website, but on the Daily Nexus and Bottom Line
as well.","With the recent events of the COLA strike, it became clear to me that President Napolitano
did not place enough emphasis on the needs of Grad Students and TAs. My number one priority
from the next President would be an administrator who will fight for the needs of their undergrad
and grad students, their faculty and their staff. Many of us have been through the hell that is
going to advising from three different departments and somehow having 7 different answers to a
simple question. I want a President who will work towards a more cohesive campus. Our UC
President should work towards sensible policy that makes living as a UCSB student easier, not
more confusing. When students gather together to ask for something that is quite basic, the UC
President should listen to what they have to say and work towards a real compromise if they
don’t have the means to fully grant these requests. The UC President is supposed to be the
embodiment of the voices of students, faculty and staff, I want the next one to fit that
description.",,"I am running for senate because I have a passion for changing my community for the better. I
love the people and atmosphere at UCSB and know that I can make the experience for future

Yuval Cohen,max,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yuval-Cohen-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,2nd,Political Science/Middle East Studies,,,"I became involved with Associated Students my freshman year of college and I absolutely fell in
love with it. The community and people that make up AS all share a similar passion for UCSB
and want to see it become the best it can be. During my short time at UCSB, I have been able to
use my passion to enact change throughout my communities. By serving on the senate, I hope to
accomplish so much more. I am running because I want to be a voice for my community, I want
to represent the students, and I want to create an environment that everyone wants to be a part of.
I believe that senate is the perfect platform and place to come together and collaborate on ideas
that can truly make a difference, and that is something that I want to be involved in.","I have been involved in the AS Office of the President for two years now. My
freshman year, I was a fellow, and this year I am currently the Director of Dream
Scholar Affairs. As a fellow, I got to learn more about AS as a whole and all of the
moving parts that make it successful at UCSB. By my second year, I knew I wanted to
continue my work in the Office of the President. I had watched the individual who had
my previous position do a phenomenal job, and I wanted to bring my ideas to the
table. Being an undocumented student, I am very connected to my position as Director
of Dream Scholar Affairs. It has allowed me to make connections throughout my
community and raise awareness about undocumented students. I have seen things that
need to change, and I know what path they must take. This experience specifically has
prepared me to be a senator because I know how AS functions and what I can do as a
senator to make an impact.","The first resolution I would like to introduce revolves around helping undocumented
students. In June, the Supreme Court is expected to release their decision on whether
or not DACA will continue. This decision is going to impact a great number of
students, including myself. I know that before I became the Director of Dream Scholar
Affairs, I was totally unsure about the resources we have at UCSB for undocumented
students. I want to create a bill that works to advertise these resources and raise
awareness throughout the entire school about undocumented students. We need more
forums, events, and information for students, documented and undocumented. A
second resolution I would like to introduce is to partner with the Isla Vista Compost
Collective and increase the amount of compost bins throughout Isla Vista.
Sustainability is very important to me, and IVCC does a great job of composting. My
house is filled with compost bins, in Isla Vista and at my family’s home. Since IVCC
just partnered with the Isla Vista Community Services District so that they can have
more resources, this year would be a perfect time to increase access to compost bins
throughout Isla Vista. Restaurants, homes, lecture halls, and more places in Isla Vista
should have available composting bins. A third resolution I would like to introduce
while in office is to collaborate with the Recreation Center and possibly IVFP, UCPD,
and CFOs to create access to self defense classes. This school year, the community
definitely felt a lack of safety and security. I believe that all students should have the
option to learn how to defend themselves from any situation. No one should ever be in
a position where they feel vulnerable. Self defense classes are a perfect way to gain
that sense of extra security.","My platform revolves around the students and meeting their needs based on what I
have seen at UCSB for the past two years. Through my connections, I have gained a
good sense in realizing the things that need to change. My goals while in office will be
to revolve my actions around the students. There are so many voices and opinions that
never get heard, and my platform hopes to reach all of those students who want to see
change but do not know how to do something about it. I am very passionate about each
of my platform statements because I have a connection to each point. My biggest goal
would have to be increasing transparency and communication. I have always been a
very open and honest individual, so I hope to reflect that on my position as a senator as
well.","I hope to work with Undocumented Student Services (USS), the Mental Health Task
Force, Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), Environmental Affairs Board, AS
Office of the President, AS Food Bank, Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), and many
more. These are the main organizations and entities that I would love to collaborate
with. I believe in their mission and I want to do everything I can to help them
accomplish what they wish. I love coming together with different, yet like-minded
individuals because I know that it can result in something great.","I plan on hosting “online office hours,” like a lot of professors and TAs are currently
doing. I will be on Zoom at certain times or people can schedule a time that works for
them to meet with me. I want to be as available as possible, so I will be very active on
social media and platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, etc. I want constituents to
have full access to me and know that they should never hesitate to reach out. I believe
that by staying involved online and on commonly frequented pages or apps, I can
make it aware to students that I want to and will work to meet their needs.","When I was growing up, it was always hard for me to know what I wanted to be. All
the kids my age would have their dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers. But I was
all over the place, and I would simply base my future on what Netflix show I was
addicted to at the moment. When I began applying to colleges, I still did not know
what I wanted to do. I had to reflect on my entire life. That was when I realized that
everything I had done up to that point screamed leadership. I was in student
government all 4 years of high school and I would even go to Sacramento and lobby
every year. These were always things I loved doing, and I never thought I could ever
turn it into a career or something more. Senior year, I promised myself I would
become involved in student government again wherever I ended up. All of freshman
year, I joined everything that sounded remotely interesting to me, which is how I fell
in love with AS. UCSB took my love of community, leading, and government and
showed me that there was so much more I could bring to the table. My experience and
passion has been building up to this, and I know that I would do an amazing job as a
senator. As someone who has always had to work a little bit harder to prove myself, I
know that I can advocate for students and make the changes that they wish to see
within their university and community. I am overall super excited for this entire
journey no matter what happens.",Left-leaning,"Very Good. I believe that the work of the 70th Senate has been very sufficient. They have accomplished
a lot, my personal favorite being the creation of a new Senate seat for international students.
But as always, more work can be done to meet the needs of students.","No. This is a very controversial topic, especially since UCSB is the only UC that has not
voted in favor of this resolution. There is a great lack of knowledge circling this topic
and I believe that we must educate students on what the results of favoring BDS
would look like. Although I would not vote in favor of it, I will be open and impartial
to all other views and I am always eager to learn more.","No. UCSB should not be tuition-free at this time because
of all the resources and academics on campus that
must be funded. But, I do believe in lowering student
fees and making college more affordable to all through
continued lobbying efforts to fund the UC.","I believe that UCSB has a lot of services available to students. As a member of the AS Office
of the President, I was involved in coordinating the Mental Health Town Hall. During the
town hall, I learned a lot more about available resources on campus, CAPS being the main
one. A big issue with CAPS is the long wait times. There are a lot of instances where
students cannot wait for an appointment. I think by advertising the other resources, such as
peer groups or the emergency call-line, students can be educated on other options they may
have. Overall, CAPS can definitely improve their efficiency, but there are more services
available at UCSB besides CAPS that should be publicized and utilized more.","I believe that the university could have handled the situation better in the beginning. They
were slow to provide resources and help to students in need or those questioning everything
that was happening. Students really needed more information, yet they did not receive
enough information from the university reports. I believe the current exec board did a great
job of providing outlets to address the sexual assault instances, such as creating the UCSB
Safer Social Event Task Force. As time passed, the situation was addressed better, but the
initial response could have been better.","I believe that Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses.
But, there are things we can do to improve the system. The expansion of programs to help
fight sexual assault and providing more resources to survivors should be available. As a
Senator, I will work towards this by meeting the needs of my constituents.","The university itself should focus on hearing the voices of these communities and
meeting their needs. The student-led Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+, and other programs
should receive extra funding and help with expansion. These communities are doing a
great job with events and promoting awareness on campus. Overall, UCSB is making
great improvement in providing resources and practicing inclusion.","My first resolution that I plan to author if I am elected to serve on the Senate is a bill to
continue and expand the Mental Health Town Hall. This past school year, the Mental
Health Town Hall was run by the Office of the President. I believe if the Senate backs and
funds this event, it can grow and reach even more people. This town hall was very
beneficial for me and answered a lot of my questions surrounding mental health,
especially at UCSB. More students should be attending this town hall because everyone
should be educated about mental health. I think that this bill will greatly benefit and help
students.","I believe that with all of the resources we have, we should be advertising them to
students more. Through social media influence, email, and on-campus
advertisements, students can become more informed.  I also think that the student
body should stay informed through programs like GOLD and GauchoSpace. Students
regularly check these systems, and if there are updates from Associated Students on
these sites as soon as students log in, I think that could have a great influence on
UCSB’s campus.","Being UC President is a very important role that should be filled by a qualified and
experienced individual. I think the top priorities for the next UC President should be about
maintaining strong and adequate health services on each campus. Considering what is
currently going on in our world with the corona virus outbreak, health should be the number
one priority. At a campus like UCSB for example, our student health center should have
easier access. More important topics include lowering tuition, providing enough resources
for undocumented students following the upcoming announcement of the Supreme Court
decision on DACA, and sustainability on each campus (composting centers, reducing waste,
etc.).",,,,,,,

Alexandra Perez,sofia,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,,,She/Her/Hers,2nd,Political Science and History of Public Policy and Law double major,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 71st senate because I want to be a better resource to those around me and help implement new ideas to better support students. I have heard the complaints of my fellow friends and peers about how they feel that the university is not doing enough to support our students, and I agree. I am running to be a senator because I have big ideas and the ambition and drive to do it. When I arrived at UCSB, I was excited but also nervous because it was a whole new world. It was challenging adjusting to the quarter system and also being away from home. A lot of students seek help from the university and while the university does provide a lot of resources, I noticed how the resources fell short when it came to helping all of the student body. I am running for senator because I want to help meet the needs of students and provide more resources so everyone who attends UCSB can succeed and feels like they belong on this campus. I am running because I want to advocate on behalf of students and create real change for this university.","I have been involved in several ways on campus. One way is by being a member of RHA and hall council. Through this, I was able to create programs and events for the Santa Catalina community and allowed me to practice my communication and leadership skills. Another way was by serving as the Outreach and Recruitment Chair for A.S. Committee on Committees. This has prepared me by developing my professional skills and collaborating with other A.S. entities to focus on outreach for people to join A.S. and help make the system meet student needs. I have also been involved on campus by being an RA. Being an RA has taught me many skills such as time management, leadership skills, community development, and much more. It has helped me become a more all-around person and has allowed me to become a better resource to not only residents but to every one of my peers. I have also been involved in the political climate on campus in ways such as protesting in solidarity with the COLA strike. These involvements have prepared me to be a senator because they have allowed me to learn the needs of my fellow peers and the ways in which our university can better support our student body.","One bill I would like to introduce while I am in office is a bill to provide free menstrual products in places on campus such as resident hall bathrooms, lecture hall bathrooms, and non-binary bathrooms, and in places around Isla Vista. I know the 69th senate passed a bill to create a committee to explore how we can provide menstrual products and I want to build on the bill by collaborating with other organizations and entities to put it into action. This is important because menstrual products can be expensive and can be a resource for students that need menstrual products. This bill would put menstrual products in lecture hall bathrooms and in gender-neutral bathrooms around campus to guarantee that any student who needs a product will be able to attain one. Another bill I would introduce is a bill to establish a quarterly A.S. senate town hall to promote transparency between elected senators and their constituents in order to hold senators accountable and collect feedback and concerns from their peers. This would help make A.S. seem more accessible and as a resource for students to use when they want their voices to be heard. A resolution I would like to introduce is a resolution to condemn the human rights violations in the form of femicides happening in Mexico. Hate crimes against women in Mexico continue to occur each day and our UCSB A.S. Senate has a commitment to fight against human rights violations.","My platform is geared to help not only my constituency of Off-Campus residents but all students at this university. I have six main ideas on my platform that focus on improving resources for students. My first is to extend the walk in-hours/availability of CAPS. I believe this is important because the health and wellbeing of students should be a top priority for the university and I believe we can do more to help students in a timely manner. I also want to collaborate with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and the EVPLA to work on how we can extend busses and provide more frequent busses to Isla Vista because a lot of students can not afford bikes and the bus is their main form of transportation. Many students rely on the 27 bus to take them to campus and because they run so infrequently and are smaller busses, a lot of students are not even able to get on a bus or have to wait long amounts of time to catch a bus. Another item on my platform is providing free menstrual products in lecture hall bathrooms and in places around Isla Vista such as the Pardall center, IV and Embarcadero Hall, and the Isla Vista Community Center. The next thing on my platform is combating food insecurity by providing more meal vouchers to residents of Isla Vista and working with Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary enterprises to work on allowing students to bring take-home storage containers to help combat food insecurity and food waste. I also want to implement a Mental Health, Sexual and Gender Diversity, and Cultural Diversity, training for incoming first-years and university employees in order to help promote a more inclusive environment for all students. Finally, I want to establish a quarterly AS-wide Town Hall as a forum for open discussion with the student body. Mandatory attendance of all senators and executives would be required in order to hold the accountability of elected officials. I would also like to extend the invitation to boards, committees, and units (BCU) chairs to encourage them to share what they are working on and what we are doing to collaborate together. I know A.S. has a connotation as being inaccessible to the student body so I want to encourage transparency and space for feedback from students in order to better serve them.","I hope to work with multiple organizations and entities to help achieve my platform. I believe we have strong organizations that already do a lot for students and should be recognized and collaborated with in order to provide more beneficial services to all students. I hope to work with the Period Chapter at UCSB, The Women’s Center (WGSE), Commission on Student Well-being(COSWB), and the Residential Hall Association (RHA) to collaborate on ways to get menstrual products in campus lecture hall bathrooms and in non-binary bathrooms around both campus and in Isla Vista. I also hope to work with the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) to help combat food waste in dining commons by working with Housing, Dining, and Auxillary enterprises to allow students to bring their own food storage containers to help combat food waste and food insecurity. I also hope to work with CAPS, Student Commission on Racial Equality (SCORE), Queer Commission, the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), and the Resource Center Sexual & Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to help create a curriculum for first-year students and UC employees to better support the student diversity reflected on this campus and to inform and provide a sense of inclusion for all incoming students current students.","If the shift to online courses continues through summer and fall quarter, I would host Zoom office hours each week to make myself available to my constituents. My constituents would also have my email to contact me at any time. I strongly believe that during this time, we as a student body should support each other and be a resource to one another in the best way that we can, whenever we can. I would also encourage my fellow senators to collaborate on a group Zoom call once a month that would be open for the student body to join. They would be able to voice their concerns and ideas to us. We would also relay information to our constituents on what we will be working on to continue to support and provide resources for students. I would love to introduce myself in Zoom lectures as a way to reach out to different students. Some constituents that would be difficult to reach are the students who do not have equal access to technology or internet access and I want to advocate on their behalf as well and be able to address their concerns. I strongly believe the university must do something to help students who do not have equal access to the internet or to technology that would give them resources to allow them to be successful at this university.","I believe I am the best candidate because I am ambitious, hardworking, and am well qualified for the position. When I was younger, my dad told me a quote that continues to motivate me today; “you’re not smart, you’re hardworking.” I work hard and do everything to the best of my ability. I am committed to the student body because I am committed to making a difference and helping all students succeed and attain the resources they deserve. As a daughter of immigrants and as a Latinx woman of color, I have been disadvantaged many times in my life, but I chose to overcome those struggles and work hard to be where I am today. My parents worked hard to allow me to be where I am today and I want to be the change I wish to see in the world, and it starts here at this university. I care very much about our campus community and believe that caring about the UCSB community is very important when it comes to leadership roles. This is reflected in my job as an RA and knowing important resources and ways to better serve our community. I have had multiple leadership experiences and am excited about helping students. In my daily life, I practice activism by advocating for students and working hard to do my best for others. I am a devout public servant and this is what I enjoy doing. I know I can help make this university a more inclusive and resourceful place for all.",Left-leaning,"Good; I think the 70th A.S. Senate did a good job in addressing the needs of the student body because they passed several resolutions such as one to reissue UCSB as a sanctuary campus and also a resolution to defeat the stigma on mental health and better support undergraduates. However, I do think a lot more student-issued bills could have been passed such as actual solutions to problems like a way to help with the stigma on mental health. As a senator, I will follow my campus-based resolutions up with bills that promote action surrounding the issue.","Yes; I would vote in favor to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement because I strongly believe that any company that profits from the violation of human rights should be condoned. The violations that Israel has perpetuated and allowed against Palestinians are not acceptable and A.S. should join other undergraduate ASUC’s to align with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. The UC system should rescind it’s funding and place it towards initiatives that address student needs like Basic Needs. ","Yes; I believe that UCSB should be tuition-free because everyone should have the opportunity to get a higher education regardless of their socioeconomic standing. The fact of the matter is, that in these times, a college degree is very valuable for the workforce. No one should be prevented from an education and the high cost of tuition is hard on certain people. UCSB should be helping its students succeed and free tuition would be the first step to better helping us students. The UC was always meant to be tuition-free and must return to that model. ","I do not believe that mental health services at UCSB are adequate. As a student that has sought help from CAPS, I can personally say that I had a bad experience. You can walk in for a brief assessment at CAPS which is good, however, you can only come in during a small window, and if you are not one of the first ones there, they won’t have any more space available. I had to go to CAPS three times before I could finally be briefly assessed. They also do not have enough therapists staffed. I know multiple students who have had to wait weeks, and even months to be seen. This is not acceptable because mental health is very important and if someone needs to be seen ASAP, it is important to see them. Furthermore, the clinical staff is lacking in people of color. I was unable to get a therapist I felt comfortable with because I hoped to have someone who was Chicanx to better understand me and my culture, but that did not end up happening. I also know they only have one psychologist for international students, one of our biggest UCSB populations. It is not acceptable that the diversity of the CAPS clinical staff does not reflect the diversity of the student body it is supposed to serve. There is already a stigma around mental health, and part of breaking that stigma is seeing people like you, that have problems like you, and especially people like you to help you. CAPS needs to hire a more diverse clinical staff and make more availability to students. That is why on my platform I have the plan to help increase the walk-in hours for CAPS in order to fit more students. It is unacceptable that so many students have to wait a long time and feel turned away because our university is not providing enough resources.","I definitely believe that the university could have handled the situation better. It took a long time for the university to address this issue and while things were still being addressed, the fraternity in question was still allowed to continue to participate in Greek life events. While I do not believe the entire fraternity should be penalized for certain member’s actions, I do believe the fraternities should have been held responsible and should have held the member/s accused accountable as soon as possible. The university sent us out an email on October 28th stating that the day before the incident occurred and not much was done until the next following weeks. The IFC (Interfraternity Council) determined the consequence for themselves, the fraternities, to place a moratorium on all social events. There was no direct action from the university and the students were left out of the loop and confused and worried about the situation. The failure to communicate clearly from the university left many students frustrated. The only thing that I know of that is being done is a “Task Force for Safer Social Events” which is trying to bring change, however, the moratorium was lifted and socials occurred once again.","I do not believe Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Title IX is complicated and confusing and with the soon to be added rules from Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, it puts the survivor in an uncomfortable position should they choose to go through with the claim by placing them in cross-examination with the perpetrator. As an RA, I was trained in Title IX briefly, and I can say it is in fact confusing. The system is flawed and can often be very discouraging to survivors because it can be confusing and long. The new added laws will also redefine harassment and make it more narrow scoped, which also turns away survivors. This system is not adequate in addressing sexual assault on UC campuses and needs to be more survivor-oriented. It disadvantages survivors who have a lack of resources whether it is financially or emotionally.","I do not believe UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups. Over the years, UCSB has made steps towards becoming more inclusive towards these communities, however, I believe the university can do better. One thing that I instantly noticed at UCSB was the lack of diversity in the faculty. I know that, for example, the department I am in does not have many professors of color. The diversity of the professors and instructors who are teaching us does not reflect the diversity of the student population. This includes sexual and gender diversity. For example, UCSB has an out list for faculty members who identify with the LGBTQ+ community and there are very few faculty who are on the list, once again not reflecting the student body. I believe that diversifying faculty is essential in order to better serve these underrepresented communities because then they would get some representation. This is just one way the university could dedicate itself to truly serving its entire student population.","If elected to serve on the Senate, the first resolution I would pass is a resolution to work with CAPS and Student Health to extend their walk-in hours/availability for students. I have heard the frustrations of many of my peers and have felt them firsthand. It is hard for a student to be seen at Student Health because it takes a while to make an appointment. Also for walk-ins, you have to often wait a while to be seen. For CAPS, it is unfair that the walk-in hours are so narrow and that if you can not go right when the walk-in hours start you can not be seen. This is important because the health and the well-being of students is important and should be a priority for the institution. It is hard enough for some people to seek help and then when they go seek it, there is no availability. I will work with fellow senators to make sure we do something to address this problem because it is not acceptable.","My job as a senator would be to not only advocate on behalf of the student body but to also be transparent with them and listen to what my constituents have to say. In my platform, I talked about how I wanted to have a quarterly AS-wide Town Hall as a forum for open discussion with the student body. This would require the mandatory attendance of all senators and executives in order to hold the accountability of elected officials. During this town hall, we would allow for students to voice their concerns or ask any questions regarding what we as senators would be doing together for students. We would advertise this town hall to inform students about this. I also think it would be a good idea to create social media platforms such as an A.S. Senate Twitter or Instagram in order to tweet bills passed and allow for UCSB community members to DM us for concerns in order to come off as less intimidating and to show that we really value the opinions of our constituents.","The priorities of the next UC President should be dedicated to the benefits of the students and not the institution. We saw how Janet handled the protest of UCSC’s TA’s who were striking for COLA(cost of living adjustment). She condoned the firing of the TA’s and made no progressive strides towards granting COLA or even engaging in a negotiation. With the COVID-19 crisis occurring currently, our striking here at UCSB got cut short as we were told that campus was closed and classes were moved to remote instruction. The new UC President should work to give COLA to the graduate teaching assistants who work hard to help the professors and us, the undergraduates, while also being students themselves. Another top priority for the next UC President is to stop the construction of the telescope on the mountain Mauna Kea as it is disrupting and violating the sacred culture of the people on the island. Finally, the next UC President must work towards making UCs more accessible to any student that wants to study at a UC. They can do this by making the UCs tuition-free or at least lessening the cost. The University of California system prides itself on being the center for research and education, but would not be able to achieve all that it has without its students and workers. The UC system receives much of its funding from donors and should be able to at least lessen the cost while maintaining the services and jobs that it provides. The UC President is supposed to serve the students and the next UC President should be devoted to the students.",,,,,,,

Rosey Lavery,sanya,L&S Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roseylavery.jpeg,,"She, her, hers",3rd,Communication,,,"I am currently running to be a senator with the 71st senate at UCSB because I have seen the dedication and passion that goes into these positions, and I want to bring the same qualities to this organization. I was lucky to be educated and involved with political movements from a young age thanks to my Dad. His job has required him to be very involved in local politics, and that led to my sister and I tagging along. Our involvement ranged anywhere from attending city hall meetings in San Francisco to being campaign volunteers for individuals such as current California Governor Gavin Newsom. It was because of this experience back home that I was excited to become involved in our own campus politics. 
Being a current Junior at our school, I have had the time and experience to become very familiar and immersed within both our campus and Isla Vista communities. UCSB has given me the chance to appreciate the great opportunities given here, but also experience aspects and services that need to be improved or implemented. As a senator, I want to be an advocate for the change and concerns students of all class standings, backgrounds, and identities want brought to the attention of the Senate. ","I have been involved with both my sorority and the Isla Vista Party during my time here at UCSB. My sophomore year, I learned about our school’s senate when a few of my friends chose to run for positions. After they told me about their platforms and all the teamwork that goes into campaigning, I knew that I wanted to be involved in some way. 
I volunteered to help them campaign in the time leading up to and during elections. From handing out fliers at the Arbor to reposting information on social media, I was there to support my friends and their goals through the entire process. Since their election, I have seen first hand all the hard work they put into their positions on and off the clock. After talking to my peers about their workload and ability to balance school work and senate, I am confident that I will thrive in this position. 
I know that I will be able to handle the workload and duties that come with being a senator because my previous experience has prepared me for it. Over the past year, I served as my sorority’s Recruitment and Marketing Vice President which taught me how to be a leader amongst my peers. My duties included multiple weekly and monthly meetings with advisors, chapter members, and the rest of our executive board. Our positions gave us the platform to make much needed change within our own organization, and I made sure to make as many changes as I could during my term. I want to bring that same mindset with me to the 71st Senate if elected. ","Considering the recent changes to our curriculum, there is going to be a lot of necessary work done by the 71st senate. If elected, my first resolution would be to ensure that all of the UCSB employees who were laid off or displaced by the Corona Virus have their jobs waiting for them once our campus reopens. The unemployment rate in our country has skyrocketed to numbers beyond that of the Great Depression in just a matter of weeks. The only way for the University to make a contribution to lowering these numbers would be to rehire their employees. From janitorial staff to campus restaurant staff, much of the non-essential employees during the lockdown have nowhere to work, but as soon as we return to what will be the new normal, there should be nothing stopping these organizations from rehiring the same individuals if they chose to return. 
My second resolution would be to stop the University from drastically increasing student fees to help finance COVID-19 related expenses and advocate for an increase in financial aid resources. The probability that the University could become financially displaced by the current pandemic is high, but the likelihood of students being financially displaced is much higher. As we continue into the future, it is our job to support the members of our community. Therefore it is the duty of the school to ensure that students affected by COVID-10 have access to financial aid resources to help them continue their education. 
My third resolution would be to finance a grant program specifically for situations such as the one COVID-19 has put us in. In order to take future precautions to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19 or any other contagions within our community, we should be providing the tools to do so and ensuring that we are prepared to fix the damage done. ","My platform has its foundation in my vision of expanding campus resources to better suit the current needs of our UCSB community. I would like to take steps to do this by collaborating with CLAS to expand one-on-one tutoring to Davidson Library and the University Center. Establishing workshops offered multiple times a year through each department in the College of Letters and Science to teach students specialized skills in their career fields is another vision that I am passionate about. Additionally, I want to implement a healthy habits movement with the help of CAPS during finals week each quarter. 
In order to keep this momentum consistent, I plan on constantly making small attainable goals that will help set the stage to achieve my long term goals. Making all of these visions a reality is going to take a lot of time and effort, but it is time and effort that I am willing to give. These aspects of my platform are just a few of the many resources on campus that are not reaching their fullest potential to meet the needs of the students on our campus. Students are struggling to teach themselves course materials, worried they don’t have what it takes to succeed in a career post graduation, and developing unhealthy study habits just to get through it all. Our university needs to hear these issues and do something to fix them, and I want to be one of the many people who will tell them that. 
","As mentioned above, I want to work with organizations such as CLAS, CAPS, and departments within the College of Letters and Science. Additionally, I want to also work with Associated Students to raise student awareness of the many resources they offer including the Food Bank and Book Bank. Each aspect of my platform requires me to meet and collaborate with leaders within each of these campus organizations. I thoroughly enjoy working on projects I am passionate about, and having the opportunity to meet with individuals who can aid me during the process is help that I am willing to take. ","During this stressful time, I know that every student has questions about how they will continue their education as we adapt to our continuously changing curriculum. From inconsistent communication between professors and students, varying lecture formats, waitlisting and crashing courses, our education is all over the place right now. If elected, my hope is to create some sort of consistency for students amidst all of this mess. 
I want to make myself available to students starting in the summer so that come Fall, senators will already have a list of needs from members of our community that we can start resolving. Whether it be over Zoom or through email, I want to have conversations with students about how we can meet individual needs and unique situations from home. By doing this, my hope is that I will be able to bring these concerns to department heads within the College of Letters and Science and work towards implementing solutions come Fall Quarter. ","I am the best candidate for the College of Letters and Science Senator because I have both the skills and the mindset needed to be successful in this position. My whole life I have been taught to be a hard worker, a problem solver, and a go-getter. These qualities have become a part of who I am, and I have utilized them to do good in any way I can. 
Whether it be playing on my lacrosse team in high school, participating in clubs, taking on a leadership position, or volunteering with local non-profits, I have always been involved in my community in various ways. Being involved in many organizations has taught me how to network, speak up for, and collaborate with members of my community. I know for a fact that these skills make me fit for the responsibilities that come with being a College of Letters and Science Senator, and I plan on utilizing them if elected to this position.",Left-leaning ,"Very good; The 2019-2020 school year has presented the 70th A.S. Senate with a variety of challenges and I believe they lived up to their duties as best as they could. The passing of resolutions to defeat the stigma surrounding mental health, to make UCSB a sanctuary campus, and to support the impeachment of Donald Trump are just a few of the resolutions passed that I stand with.  ",I am not fully educated enough on the situation taking place in Israel & Palestine to make an adequate vote on this matter at the time. The fact that this is such a serious decision requires one to be aware of the positives and the negatives of choosing to divest or not to. I plan to look further into the matter to do just that.,"Yes; While it would be much less of a financial burden on students for UCSB to be a tuition-free institution, our tuition is what funds many of the events thrown on campus and pays the salaries of our staff. Until the day comes that UCSB is tuition free, students must continue to pay tuition in order for the university to continue functioning the way it does, In order to support the students who at this time cannot afford our tuition, we must ensure that we raise awareness and continue to provide the financial aid and support that our university provides.","While I do believe there are adequate resources for mental health services, what is lacking is the access to these services. Students who are in need of urgent mental health services often find themselves unable to see a professional until 2-4 weeks later. We must first address the problem by hiring more staff at CAPS in order to open more appointment times for students. In addition, CAPS should begin hosting workshops on mental health education so that students are more aware of the signs that they might need professional help.  ","In a situation such as this, it’s the University’s responsibility to ensure all accusations are heard and investigated with all seriousness. As a woman at UCSB and a member of Greek life on campus, I can speak for many of my peers when I say it is our right to be informed of sexual assault accusations made within our community. At the same time, I do not need to know every detail within the case because we also want to make sure we are centering survivors. While the university should make students aware of where and when the event took place and investigate all accusations to the fullest extent, the majority of information should be limited to those involved. The steps taken by IFC and Panhellenic in response to these reports has shown that our community has not taken this situation lightly, but further steps must be taken by the University to put an end to sexual assault once and for all. 
","There are many pros and cons when it comes to addressing how adequate Title IX is to address sexual assault on campus.  When it was written into law, Title IX opened the door for women to equally participate in the workplace and at educational institutes. But since its implementation, various forms of sexual assault and harrassment still occur within these institutions, and are often brushed off. It is my personal opinion that when it comes to addressing accusations, Title IX leaves University staff too much leeway when it comes to interpreting what is to be defined as sexual assault. A better line of communication must be established between law enforcement and Universities in order for things to improve. ","I myself am not a member of a historically underrepresented group, so I am not the person to determine if our university is effectively serving them. Using my position as an L&S senator, I want to hear first hand from groups within the Multicultural Center and organizations serving our LGBTQ community how our university can better serve them.  ","If elected to serve on the Senate, my first resolution would be to expand CLAS to have one-on-one tutoring sign ups at both the University Center and Davidson Library. This has the potential to aid many students in their studies as a great majority frequently utilize these campus buildings for studying purposes. By expanding CLAS beyond the Student Resource Building, more appointment times will become available to students as a result. ","As a member of A.S., I plan on making myself accessible to the average student by utilizing social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to repost and update the student body on Senate activities. While most of our student body is currently on our platforms, there are many that still aren’t. I believe that the creation of a weekly or monthly Senate newsletter to be sent to student’s UCSB emails would be a creative way to make sure that every student has the tools to keep themselves updated on bills, resolutions, and senate activities. ","I see the top priority for the newly hired UC President being the efforts that need to be taken in order to recover from the damage COVID-19 has done to our community. Many university staff and laborers have been put out of work or laid off due to the UC campus closures. Once the campuses reopen and we transition back to in-person classes, the new UC President should work to ensure that all staff who were displaced by the campus closures have the opportunity to return to their jobs.

Nadav Kempinski,max,Engineering Senator,Independent,,,He/Him/His,3rd,Human Centered Engineer,,,"I believe in supporting your community to the best of your ability, and my engineering peers have truly been there for me through the good and the bad -- it’s time for me to pay that back. 

My experience in AS on Committee on Committees helped me understand what works (and what really just doesn’t) in our association, and I’m ready to turn that into positive change for our engineers. 

I’m often faced with comments from non-engineering students such as, “You don’t seem like the typical engineer I’d expect,” or “I don’t have any other engineering friends.” My time in the college has shown me that there’s diversity in our college, and the reason we’re often not seen is systemic. My goals this term are to create more opportunities on campus for engineering students to engage with non-engineering activities and programs, to offer our unique skillset (as so many others on campus have) and to gain from others’ perspective. 

Our campus is strong when working, united, towards the betterment of all students -- it’s time to get AS behind our backs. 
","The best student leaders are the ones who understand the community and can turn experience into movement. Working in campus-org leadership has prepared me in understanding what students groups need to further their work and I’m set on being a resource to these community-engagers. Our student body is vibrant because of our wealth of communities -- let’s come together to provide our students access to campus resources and create experiences together. 

I’ve been part of the Gaucho Tour Association, Model UN, Adventure Programs, Sigma Eta Pi, Sunrise Movement, TableTalk, TAMID, AS, Engineers Without Borders, Design For America + more -- it’s really been a ride 😅! The UCSB campus has provided me with so many opportunities and my goal is to provide back. 
","-INCREASE CAPSTONE FUNDING for independent projects so engineering students can focus on personal interests such as sustainability rather than defense corporations. 
-EXPAND FOOD RESOURCES on campus to target where student populations spend the most time, ensuring food is never a question of cost, time or accessibility. 
-ENGAGE CLAS SERVICES to cover lower-division classes with at least 50 students to ensure students begin their studies on campus with the proper support and resources. 
-ADVOCATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH on campus by resolving AS towards finding innovative methods to fund increased CAPS support on campus and continue programs such as Peer Advising that bring the community together in supporting one another. 
","Ensure basic needs and improve academic support. Focusing on improved food and mental health services will help students’ holistic wellbeing, and improved academic resources will support students to excel in their coursework while having more time to take care of themselves and focus on their interests -- these are two aspects of campus life that I’ve seen in my peers to be pressing matters. 

I’ll be working with the vast resources that AS holds in placing funding behind our goals -- millions of student-sourced dollars that deserve to be spent the way that students need. 

I’ll liaise closely with student groups, focused on engineering groups, to ensure that student needs are heard and properly brought to the table. 

And I’ll work with faculty from across the departments to see where we can find interdisciplinary opportunities for our students. We are learning actionable skills -- we should utilize them to make our community more resilient. 
","Engineers: Engineering Student Council (as a given), ASME, IEEE and AIChE, to get representational up-to-date views on what engineers are looking for on campus. 

Professional Orgs: SWE, Los Ingenieros, NSBE, Engineers Without Borders, Professional Fraternities (ASK, PSR, Theta Tau, etc), and Design for America to engage communities where engineers tend to spend time -- all in attempts to reach students in the communities they care about most. 

My platform is only as strong as the support it receives from the people. My direct aim is to create community dialogue on finding enactable positive change, and my time will be spent first and foremost towards creating that platform. My determination to create interdisciplinary communication will help lead those thoughts into action, but it starts with clear dialogue. 
","Walk in office hours continue to be effective during stay-at-home orders, as I’ve been doing in other leadership positions as of yet. My phone, email, Facebook and Zoom are all openly available (which I all check hyper-frequently), emails through the CoE listserv regarding my support for engineering students, and personal reach-outs to campus leaders so they know I’m keen to hearing their ideas. 
","I wish I had the chance this quarter to better get to know the others running for the CoE position -- I’m sure that any of us would be great candidates in creating real change for CoE students. I’m believe I’m qualified and truly believe that I would make a strong representative for our students, due to my engagement with the CoE faculty and advisors in creating the school’s first Independent Major, through my extracurricular connections across various communities throughout campus providing me with the instant ability to work with those groups, through my understanding of what engineering students are interested in, and that my visions for change aren’t deterred by the ability of previous Senates to enact change. A vote for Nadav Kempinski is a vote for direct focus on the population, rather than just the ideas within me. 
","Left-leaning
","Good: Given my time studying abroad during Fall, a frenzied Winter and an online Spring, I was unable to first-hand witness what the 70th Senate has accomplished. In the past I’ve witnessed a toxic environment within the Senate, providing a terrible role model for other campus leaders. I’ve heard the 70th Senate has provided a conducive environment for improving student conditions -- along with signalling support for this year’s important COLA wildcat strike -- I applaud their work.
","No: For transparency, I was born in Israel and have no interest in boycotting my country, my friends or my family who live there. I’ve attended both BDS meetings my first 2 years and witnessed the amount of sheer emotion that our campus brings to the conversation, and have no faith in policy’s ability to support campus through this emotional struggle. I’ve been in favor of conversation between both sides and finding common ground. I have stated before and would continue to support a complete divestment of the UC from companies who engage in warfare or human rights violations. ","Yes: It may not happen while we’re in our undergraduate studies, but cost-barriers have no place stopping bright minds who choose education. Grants and scholarships are nowhere near the service they need to be, and the method we utilize to test students’ ability to gain access to additional funding (ACT and SAT scores, their ability to write) are flawed. The UC will have to find alternative methods of funding, and a slow transition would need to occur, but I believe it is both possible and inevitable.","Far from adequate. When it’s common to hear that students who seek support are finding waiting times of weeks to months, for issues that are much more present and severe for students, there’s an obvious lacking in services for our size in population and need. This isn’t just on our campus -- the US and California are all lacking in support services and funding to meet the needs of students. We need to push for advocacy on the state and federal level for further funding, we need to push for innovation from our therapists and social workers, and we need to focus our on-campus resources to foster supportive communities. 
","Although I was abroad and not present to understand the situation, and I am lacking in the specifics of what occurred, it has been common knowledge that university campuses are ripe with sexual assault cases across the nation. It is imperative for campus administration to take all allegations of sexual assault seriously, to investigate community members’ potential lack of safety, and to ensure that students can feel comfortable in the greater community. A student body that does not feel comfortable in the midst of its fellow students needs to be addressed.","It’s been saddening to hear the sheer amount of cases that deal with Title IX on UCSB campus, and although I do not know the full extent that Title IX either supports or inhibits those who experience sexual assault, I will continue to be a supporter and ally for those who demand reform on our university campus to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in our homes, on our campus and in our community. Title IX’s role in increasing student engagement in campus-affiliated activities for all regardless of gender identity of expression should be maintained, and we should strive beyond federal policy to enable further engagement.","I don’t personally identify as a part of historically underrepresented communities on campus and therefore cannot speak for their experiences on campus and in the area, or as to whether our campus is providing the resources and outreach necessary for them to succeed. As a part of the Gaucho Tour Association, I’ve been impressed with our focus on outreach towards underrepresented communities and continuing our designation as #1 Hispanic Serving Institute in the United States, yet this is only one measure of the work we’re doing for one group of students. 

I feel that our campus is far from properly serving these communities as stratification between communities is extremely prevalent -- only a community that engages communally can be seen as a resilient one. I will support all measures that help bring underrepresented groups to the table, to ensure the presence of resources on campus allowing students’ access to information and support, and outreach programs that help inspire youth from communities across the state to consider higher education as accessible and offer financial support to do so. 
","Increased food access on campus. Buildings or facilities which see high levels of engagement from the student population should be given funds to offer healthy foods to the students who utilize the space. Considering for example the CAD Lab, a room which often sees 200 students filter through during a given day and spending hours for each visit, its department should be given the resources to offer students food so that they can focus on their studies without compromise on nutrition. I’d aim to work with the UC Global Food Initiative, the AS Food Bank, Calfresh representatives and the departments on campus to offer this program to students and ensure its effectiveness. 
","Students have their own activities and ongoings that are important to their lives -- we should focus on improving accessibility and transparency without increasing necessity or time commitment for keeping up on what’s going on. A simple revamp of the AS website from link-based information to dynamic offerings could provide clarity as to bill and resolution updates instead of the current web of broken links, offer up-to-date Senator Office Hours with locations, could provide all upcoming events and bill considerations in a clear fashion and offer the proper social media handles to contact for further information. Marketing of this single address would provide the resource necessary for students who are interested in engaging in Associated Students to do so, without further burdening the body with a legislative focus. I’d be happy to draft a site and seek approval for the integration.

Those who wish to become a part of AS should be kept up to date with all openings, and those aiming for candidacy into the Executive or Legislative branches should understand what actions are taken by students in those roles -- as a Senator I would work to provide transparency in role and action, to both inspire others to engage in the legislative process and to show that students in all positions of power on campus have the ability to inspire change. 
","The job of UC President is vast and as undergraduates we often don’t see the entirety of the role, but I would expect the next UC President to have the ability to negotiate with unions and students on campus without utilizing threatening tactics such as removing community members from the community. I fully supported the COLA wildcat strikes this past quarter and continue to do so, and will further my support for the people who work to make the day-to-day operations of this university possible.",,,,,,,
Surya Pugal,max,Engineering Senator,Independent,,,He/Him/His,2nd,Computer Science Major and Social Justice Minor,,,"When I first started at UCSB, I was daunted by the prospects of college, struggling to cope with being away from home while acclimating to a new environment. My first quarter was rough to say the least, as I found myself struggling with sleep deprivation, irregular meals, and an overwhelming pressure to succeed in my courses. However, it's because of the support of my professors and friends who've reached out to me that I've been able to make it this far and validate to myself that I do belong in this amazing community of like-minded engineers.
 I’m running for senate because I want to make sure that no student feels like they are less than, unworthy, or not enough. Sometimes the rigor of this university can easily make you feel like you’re not smart enough and that you somehow slipped through the cracks to get to where you are. Being in student government would give me a chance to be a part of the decision making process and advocate for my friends and peers. As cliche as it sounds, I’m running because I want to get the opportunity to use my skills and experiences to  work with the people around me and shape the university for the better. 
","I have been a tutor for five quarters for lower-division computer science courses, which and has given me the opportunity to hear out students’ concerns regarding the curriculum, as well as more personal concerns about coping with the workload and stress that accompany their courses. I have also been involved more recently in the CS Undergraduate Curriculum Restructuring Team, working in a team of five computer science undergrads under Professor Richert Wang to help reshape CS16, 24, and 32 (introductory sequence in computer science) to provide more engaging material to better immerse students in the learning experience and create projects which they can be proud of. We are also working to add a CS24 placement exam, to provide students who have taken AP Computer Science the opportunity to skip out of CS16. 

I am currently a member of the Engineering Student Council, an organization that seeks to promote recreational events on campus pertaining to engineering, as well as facilitate the interaction of different engineering clubs to promote more interclub spaces. In the future, I hope to promote workshops on how to procure research in engineering, something which is sorely lacking with COE and is more geared towards L&S students.
","I hope to introduce a bill to increase funding for tutoring programs pertaining to engineering on campus. The computer science tutoring program, for instance, is relatively new and the amount of tutors the program can accept is significantly limited by funding, resulting in tutors only being able to be serve lower division computer science courses (only in Winter 2020 were we able to get to expand the course to CS130B, in which tutors were in high demand). 

I also want to author a bill to promote the creation of a COVID-19 financial relief fund and creation of an accompanying committee pertaining to COVID-19 relief. Covid-19 is the single biggest issue that students currently faced and introduced a myriad of problems such as unprecedented job loss and increased xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment. We need to ensure that the UCSB learning environment is still accommodating of people’s financial needs, which for many has taken a turn for the worse in what appear to be uncertain times. 

Finally, I want to push for a bill to add mental health advisors within engineering advising, as students who are experiencing stress as a result of the large workload that may come with their questions will find it comforting to get not only practical, but personal support in the process of asking for help.
","My platform is rooted in educational access and mental health. My approach to addressing the issue of educational access is three-fold. First is increasing minority representation within STEM. To do this, I am  going to work with clubs dedicated to pushing for adequate representation of minorities. Also, I want to sponsor a bill in senate pertaining to a COVID-19 financial relief fund, allowing for students who are disproportionately affected by the circumstances that have arisen as a result of the pandemic to be able to still have access to a secure learning environment, with minimal burden. Finally, I want to expand existing tutoring programs to ensure that students are able to request for help from their peers in classes that are understaffed or extremely difficult. This pertains specifically to CLAS and the current undergraduate learning assistance program within COE
        
With regards to mental health, I want to push for imposter syndrome and anxiety workshops, which are prevalent within STEM. This will be done in conjunction with CAPS and Student Health. Furthermore, I’m seeking to introduce a bill to streamline the transition of mental health resources online.  All of this will help to destigmatize mental health and help students feel secure. 
","First, I want to work with CAPS to assist with improving existing mental health facilities and programs, as well as aiding with the online transition of mental health resources. Also, I’m hoping to collaborate with CAPS or the CS ULA’s (computer science undergraduate learning assistants) to increase and improve tutoring resources for the upcoming school year.

I will be additionally working with the Engineering Student Council, of which I am currently a member of to oversee engineering club activities as well as try and facilitate club collaboration, not just within COE to cultivate inter-club spaces. If elected, I’m also hoping to work with WiCS (Women in Computer Science), oSTEM, SWE (Society of Women Engineers), Los Ingenieros, and a number of other organizations dedicated to pushing for adequate representation of women, LGBTQ+, Latinx, and other minority groups within STEM. Also, to help students destress and provide recreational events, I’m seeking to collaborate with Tau Beta Pi and Theta Tau, who specialize in helping promote a welcoming environment for engineering students. Organizations like SBHacks and WomxnHacks, which provide a medium for the creation of engineering projects through hackathons, are also groups that I’m seeking to interact with. Finally, although not an organization, I’m hoping to work with the lower division computer science professors and faculty to get additional insight on what students need most.
","Firstly, I will hold office hours both through Zoom, depending on the status of COVID-19. I will also be available via appointment, and do my best to work around the schedules of others. I’ll also try and set up a website where students can address their concerns about particular issues. Other means of communication that students could contact me through would be email and phone call. Furthermore, if elected, I will seek out and work with like-minded and passionate students to determine what issues are important and propose solutions for said issues. For lower-division courses, I will try to contact professors and send out surveys at the beginning and end of each quarter to get student input about what issues are most important to them. Also, during the campaign process, I plan on making a Facebook group regarding my campaign and what I plan to do. If elected, I will use the group as another medium for students to get in touch with me to ask me questions. Although I’m still learning how to use Instagram and Snapchat, those are also viable means for students to voice their concerns or questions. Finally, I will work with the COE office to make routine email announcements for important issues.","I have done everything I can to the best of my ability, and if elected to Senate, will continue to pursue the same degree of hard work. If people vote for you to be in a position of authority, they are effectively putting their trust in you, something which I will not abuse. I am not faultless and make mistakes, but I will never hide this from the people I work -- transparency is key as a senator. 

Over the past five quarters I have tutored for computer science, I have been able to serve as not only a peer mentor but a personal friend for many. Being able to play a part in their successes has made me thankful for this gratifying job I have. I believe my empathetic nature will help me in understanding people’s needs when working with them. Most of all, being able to bring out the best in people brings out the best in me.

This university has provided me a home away from home, and being able to do my part in improving the campus would be an immense privilege. My policies, platforms, experiences, and organizational involvement reflect my personal character, something which I believe embodies what is needed for the College of Engineering senator position. 
","Left-leaning
","Good: The 70th senate has passed several bills, such as meal plans to provide options to roll over leftover meals and promote disarmament of I.V police, to the benefit of the student community. However, there is a lot more that needs to be done with regards to mental health and access to assistance with upper-division engineering courses. Very few, if any, resolutions focused on the engineering community have been passed, let alone discussed within this year’s senate. There needs to be more engagement between the engineering community and the senate representatives to ensure that appropriate needs are being met. 
","Yes: Any corporation that exploits the suffering of people for personal benefit must be held accountable. However, a large reason why the previous attempt to pass a resolution on this failed was due to concerns about encouraging anti-semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment. To avert concerns and ensure attempts at passing said bill are successful, I would do so under a blanket resolution calling for divestment from companies that profit from the perpetration of human rights abuses worldwide, and not just centered in Israel. Palantir, which recruits on UC campuses and has frequently aided ICE in their operations, is an example of this.","Yes: As a set of public institutions, the UC’s have an obligation to ensure unfettered access to education, regardless of income status. Existing financial aid programs, such as Pell Grants and Cal Grants, are not sufficient enough alone to address demonstrated financial need. At the very least, in light of current circumstances, students ought to see a significant reduction in tuition due to diminished access to campus resources.

Making UCSB tuition-free would both address the overwhelming accumulation of student debt and draw in more low-income applicants who otherwise perceived college as an unaffordable investment. 
","CAPS and Student Health have done an adequate job when it comes to taking care of students’ mental health issues. Student Health has put on a number of events dedicated to ensuring that the student body feels safe and is able to cope with the workload and stress that can prove overwhelming at times. Also, CAPS has offered facilities including counseling services and a mental health peers program, both of which have helped students in times of need. However, a large number of students are unaware about CAPS services, particularly within engineering. To address this issue, I plan on working with lower-division course professors to post information about CAPS on the class forums (Gauchospace, Piazza, etc.) as well as working with the mental health peers program to help advertise CAPS services during the first two weeks on lecture, when students are getting acquainted with their classes. Furthermore, I plan on working with select clubs (WiCS, oSteam, Los Ingenieros, SASE, etc.) as well as the CS office, to hold workshops about imposter syndrome and anxiety, to both destigmatize mental health and ensure that students never see themselves as unworthy or undeserving. In light of COVID-19, I also want to help introduce resolutions to help facilitate access to mental health services online to make sure needs are being met.
","There was a lot the university could and should have done with regards to addressing the reports of sexual violence on campus. The university states that rules and regulations that were in place prohibited them from responding faster, but the fact that sexual assault within fraternity spaces continues to be a recurring problem is indicative of the lack of proper regulations that have not been instituted and enforced by the administration. Firstly, we need to introduce regular workshops about sexual assault and consent, either in the form of a senator or in conjunction with Student Health. Current online info sessions are irregularly in place and as evidenced by recent events, have negligible impact on curbing sexual assault. Furthermore, we need an independent third party to oversee the IFC and major events conducted by fraternities to ensure all respective people are held accountable in a timely manner in situations where sexual violence arises. The current method of oversight has shown to be ineffective and only works as a temporary measure. 
","With the introduction of Title IX has come the decreased perpetuation of educational gender stereotypes and increased access to career opportunities for women. Nonetheless, Title IX alone is not an adequate measure for adressing sexual assault on college campuses. Despite its presence, we have observed a number of sexual assault cases within UCSB and has little to no effect on deterring sexual violence. Furthermore, the ambiguity in the way Title IX was easily exploited by the current presidential administration to promote, according to the New York Times, a strict definition of gender on a biological basis by using the person’s sex at birth. This conflation of gender and sex invalidates the presence of transgender students, as evidenced by UC Berkeley senator Isabella Chow’s refusal to affirm a bill to protect transgender students from violence as well as the more recent case of transphobia at a Sigma Nu party this Februrary. As mentioned in the response to question 13, UCSB must enact additional regulations on fraternity spaces, as well as push for an independent third party to work with the IFC. This way, we are able to reduce the number of sexual assault cases, as well as better hold all involved people responsible.
","UCSB has a number of different facilities dedicated to promoting a welcoming community for students of all backgrounds. From the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity to the various organizations pushing for representation of underrepresented communities within STEM and other exclusive spaces, UCSB has made a strong effort to combat discrimination within the community. However, the campus has also failed to take decisive action when it mattered most.

The anti-black rhetoric experienced by the BSU last February when meeting with administration to advocate for increased black student resources and the construction of a Malcolm X Center is one such glaring example. During a party hosted by Sigma Nu, the administration failed to immediately hold anyone accountable for the evident transphobia and bigotry first addressed on the subreddit r/UCSantaBarbara. And more recently, the perpetuation of COVID-19 related xenophobia, particularly within online forums pertaining to UCSB such as Free and For Sale, a Facebook group for selling items, have gone largely unaddressed by administration, despite the fact that news outlets such as the LA Times and USA TODAY have reported specifically on these incidents. Inaction should never be a valid course of action, and future ASUC senators need to call out when it happens. 

","If elected, the first resolution I intend to pass would be pushing for the institution and expansion of a COVID-19 Financial Relief Fund. Right now, COVID-19 is the biggest issue students face on campus, resulting in the transition to online resources, unprecedented job loss, and increased xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment. We need to ensure that the UCSB learning environment is still accommodating of people’s financial needs, which for many has taken a turn for the worse in what appear to be uncertain times. The resolution will be modeled off that of UC Berkeley’s, which was proposed in early April by Senator Romario. 
        To implement this, I hope to work with Student Affairs and well as clubs representing underrepresented communities, whom, as Senator Romario points out, will be disproportionately affected by the increased barriers in health and social services. The bill would also push for the creation of an independent committee to oversee the collection of funds accumulated from financial grants and crowdfunding. The committee would additionally aid in the online transition of certain organizations and resources, such as mental health (CAPS) and tutoring services (CLAS or alternative tutoring club). The resolution may be split into two resolutions if the scope ends up getting too large.
","One thing I would do is to increase engagement with clubs and organizations on campus. To do this, I would schedule a meeting time with all engineering-related clubs to address concerns they have. I would also facilitate additional club gatherings through ESC, or the Engineering Student Council, to provide a space for clubs to interact with one another and determine mutual needs. 
I also intend to draft meaningful resolutions within the engineering community, such as expanding our mental health program and CAPS capacities, as well as expanding tutoring capabilities of CLAS, the CS tutor program, and other clubs which provide tutoring services. Right now, not a lot has been achieved by the senate with regards to engineering, consequently resulting in a disconnect between the senate and the students which it serves. 
Also, allowing for students to readily access bills and resolutions provides a much needed sense of transparency and keeps students posted on where the senate and its members stand on particular issues of importance. One way to do this would be to provide a readily accessible link to find the bills and resolutions discussed by the senate on the website. 
Finally, offering polls and surveys within engineering courses during the start and end of each quarter regarding what issues students currently see as important and possible solutions that they would suggest would provide an outlet for students to voice their input and feel they are being heard.  
","The next UC president has to be a proponent for diversity within UC campuses and push for adequate representation of students from a variety of different backgrounds and experiences. This also calls for increased acceptance of in-state students, whose proportional acceptance rates have been decreasing over the past couple of years, as well as helping undocumented students at any UC with the aid they need. Certain college campuses have faced heavy criticism for enabling ICE operations, and we need to ensure that this is not the case for our successive president. He or she also needs to be able to adequately address the COLA movement, pertaining to ensuring adequate living conditions and wages for graduate student workers, and be willing to work with labor unions. Furthermore, said president needs to be decisive and frequently reach out to the student community to address common issues, something of utmost importance especially now given the increased social disconnect as a result of COVID-19. As Felicia Mello from CalMatters points out, the president’s “decisions will shape not only their institutions, but the future of public higher education in the state and nationally”, so we must ensure that whoever we pick truly has the students’ interests at heart.
