Dominic Wang,,Off-Campus Senator,,,he/they,2nd,Undeclared,,,"I am running to be a senator because in this past year, I have seen ridiculous abuses of power by AS Senate. To me, the 74th AS Senate is a bureaucratic mess. By running for AS Senate, I hope to cut through the bureaucracy, and be an advocate for students. Many people in AS senate have claimed to listen to students, but ultimately, students’ needs are still not being met. We are struggling to make ends meet. As someone who has experienced the struggle, I bring a fresh perspective and a simple goal; change. AS Senate spends its time arguing; simply put, I am sick of it.","I have been involved in mutual aid projects in Isla Vista; this is most of what motivated me to run. Working with Food Not Bombs Isla Vista, I’ve seen students who are barely making it paycheck to paycheck, or struggling to get food, and I’ve helped them. I have spoken to locals who talked to me about being pushed into homelessness by over admittance of students. I’ve handled tough situations with homeless people who are upset at their mistreatment. These experiences taught me the most vital part of aid is solidarity. I refuse to be a self-serving candidate; as I run, I remember the struggles that students experience, and I refuse to turn my back on our community.","The first bill I would like to introduce during my term is a divestment bill. The fact that AS senate sends money to Israel is ludicrous considering how many people are struggling here. I refuse to stand with the status quo and continue to let people starve here and be bombed in Gaza and shot in the West Bank. The second bill I would introduce is a bill to provide increased funding to community support groups, such as AS Food Bank, the IV Tenants Union, and Life of the Party. Harm reduction and food and housing aid are vital parts of our continued survival. These resources are underfunded and being ignored; I hope to change this. The third and final piece of legislation I would introduce is a resolution to condemn the UC’s actions with regards to the housing crisis. The UC continues to refuse to offer adequate care to students it has already admitted, while putting more incoming students in this position; this is unacceptable, dangerous behavior.","My main platform is divestment from war and reinvestment in community. This is pretty self-explanatory; the UC spends money investing in violence and colonization across the globe while ignoring the needs of its own students, who pay tuition. Instead of continuing to let this happen, I will work towards a divestment bill, and a reinvestment of this money into vital community safety groups. By pushing for divestment, I hope to open up a new pocket of money that could be used to hire housing advocates, fund the AS Food Bank, and provide more food, basic needs, and harm reduction services to the community.","I hope to work with the AS Food Bank to improve funding and work on the needs of the student body. I also hope to work with UCSB DSP to improve their notetaker programs, and increase funding to the Mobility Transportation Program. Furthermore, I hope to work with DSP, the Isla Vista Community Services District, and UCSB transportation services to improve the conditions of the roads and sidewalks in and around UCSB and Isla Vista. This would allow for students who are physically disabled to more easily travel around Isla Vista. Finally, I hope to work with the IV Tenants Union to increase the amounts of housing advocates available to students.","I am always reachable on Instagram! Furthermore, I will establish hours that I am reachable physically at the Arbor. Anyone who is interested in respectfully discussing their needs will be welcome. I will be an elected representative of the student body, and it will be my moral responsibility to listen to my constituents and represent their needs best. Furthermore, I will continue to volunteer with mutual aid projects in Isla Vista, including Food Not Bombs Isla Vista, and will continue to keep an ear to the ground with regards to the needs of homeless and housing insecure students. Unlike past elected officials, I will listen to you!","My experience is different than most candidates’, and in my opinion it makes me uniquely qualified to support constituents in material ways. My main source of experience is from mutual aid projects in Isla Vista; through these projects, I have learned that the most sustainable way to make change is through solidarity and action. I have learned from students who are housing insecure and homeless that the support they need is support that will last. I will stand in solidarity with every struggling student on and off this campus, and when it comes down to it, I will take any action necessary to fight for their needs.",Left-leaning,Very Poor,Yes,"I believe that UCSB spends too much money on the Gaza genocide, and not enough supporting its own students. Of course I will support a divestment resolution.",Yes,"College is an important educational step that opens so many doors. I believe that everyone is entitled to an education, no matter their financial background.","I do not believe that mental health services at UCSB are adequate; as someone who has struggled with mental health, UCSB’s mental health professionals are simply not reachable. CAPS therapists switch every few appointments and students who have spent time building a relationship with their therapists are thrown into the waters of a new person they do not know. This is not accessible therapy. Outside of UCSB, therapy is simply too expensive and difficult for many people to get. I believe that UCSB should invest more money into mental health services and hire more therapists so that every student who needs one can work with one for long periods of time. Furthermore, UCSB is an extremely high stress situation; it is not acceptable to continue to put students through these kinds of stresses. Class stress must be reduced.",,,"I believe AS senators actively make AS Senate more inaccessible for students; it’s impossible to read AS bylaw for example. Anyone trying to understand what AS senate is doing struggles. At the April 4th, 2024 Senate meeting, the behavior of AS Senators was so confusing and actively disruptive that many students hoping to make public comment for the meeting on the recall election of the current AS President were discouraged. This is an undemocratic way of acting. As someone who would constantly stay in communication with the student body, I will be available to communicate every decision with students who are confused. I will work on posts in conjunction with other Senators about the decisions made by AS Senate, explaining them to the general student body.","I believe Senate’s role during this time is to fight for the needs of the most marginalized of students. Senators should be acting out the needs of their constituents and they have not been. Instead of ignoring the demands of the student body for their own perspectives, they should represent. Furthermore, senators should be open about their perspectives. They should be honest about what they believe and what actions they are taking. As elected officials, senators need to understand that they need to represent the needs of students, and if they are not doing that, that they should at least be honest about it. They should not be allowed to claim neutrality.","I would not have approved of the MCC temporary suspension, because the MCC serves as a safe space for students of color, one of a few on this campus. The decision to suspend the MCC was quite frankly racist. I would have worked with other senators to present a united front and demand that the administration of UCSB reopen the MCC as soon as possible. Furthermore, I would have worked within my ability to protect the students who had been doxxed, while condemning the doxxers. I would have worked on a resolution with other Senators to condemn the doxxing of students, especially black, brown and Arab students."
Ella Yu,,International Senator,,,She/her,Sophomore,Communication and German,,,"I am running for the position of AS International Senator because I believe in the power of representation and advocacy for UCSB's diverse international student body. My passion for enhancing the UCSB experience for every international student is driven by my own experiences growing up in a multicultural environment in Shanghai and navigating various cultural landscapes. As a Communication and German major with extensive leadership experiences, including my role at the 2023 APEC Conference, I am uniquely positioned to bridge cultural gaps and promote an inclusive community at UCSB. My campaign is not just about a title; it's about making real changes that enrich our campus life, ensuring every international student feels welcomed, supported, and empowered.","My involvement in organizations such as CSSA’s International Cultural Exchange Department and my participation in the American Marketing Association and Women in Media has equipped me with the skills and insights necessary for this role. Organizing cultural events like the Spring Festival and Mid Autumn Festival has honed my ability to manage large-scale projects and foster communal ties. Additionally, my engagement in these groups has provided me with a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities within our campus community, preparing me to effectively advocate for and support international students in the senate.","During my term, I plan to introduce the International Gaucho Nutritional Assistance Program to address dietary needs specific to international students, including partnerships with local eateries for discounts and cooking classes. Secondly, the International Career Fair & Legal Aid Initiatives will connect students with sponsors and provide essential legal workshops, preparing them for professional success in the U.S. Lastly, the Global Gaucho Integration & Orientation Program aims to facilitate smoother transitions for international students through pre-arrival modules and in-person orientation sessions focused on U.S. cultural and academic norms.","My platform is built on three pillars: nutritional support, career and legal aid, and cultural integration. To achieve these goals, I plan to collaborate with UCSB’s Food Bank, local businesses, career services, and legal experts to create programs that directly address the needs of international students. By leveraging existing resources and establishing new partnerships, I will ensure these initiatives not only launch successfully but also sustainably benefit students. Regular feedback loops will be established to continuously adapt and improve the offerings based on student needs and experiences.","To effectively implement my initiatives, I will partner with UCSB’s Food Bank, Career Services, and the Office of International Students and Scholars. Collaborations with other cultural and academic student organizations will also be instrumental in promoting and refining the programs.","I commit to being accessible to my constituents through regular office hours held both virtually and on campus to accommodate different schedules and preferences. I will also utilize social media platforms and email newsletters to keep students informed and engaged. Regular meetings and feedback sessions will be organized to discuss ongoing issues and gather input on new initiatives, ensuring transparency and responsiveness in my role.","My unique background as an international student from Shanghai, combined with my leadership experience and active participation in campus organizations, makes me the best candidate for this position. My proven track record of organizing successful cultural events and leading initiatives that promote inclusivity and understanding provides me with the insights and skills needed to effectively represent and advocate for UCSB’s international students. My dedication to creating a supportive and enriched campus environment is matched by a clear and actionable platform tailored to the needs of our diverse student community.",I choose not to publicly share my stance on this specific issue.,I choose not to publicly share my stance on this specific issue.,No," Please note that while I am required to select an option of 'Yes' or 'No' due to the format of this survey, I choose not to publicly share my stance on this specific issue at this time.

Lily Habas,,College of Creative Studies Senator,,,she/her,3rd,Art,,,"I am running for senator because I have felt disappointed by the mismanagement exhibited by the majority of the current senate during this year. Beyond issues within the Senate itself, progress has been stalled by a refusal to cooperate and senators feeding their political interests. I hope to be part of a senate that addresses the genuine needs of students without a desire for personal political gains, in addition to finally divesting student funds from war.","I have considered myself an organizer and activist for some time, but my involvement in the new UCSB chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace this year spurred me to make a change at the government level. The organization aligns with my personal anti-war and pro-divestment beliefs and has been a wonderful community for creating change at local and global levels.","My highest priority is cooperating with other senators on a resolution demanding the divestment of student funds from war by the university. Additionally, I am devoted to procuring ample funding to expand basic needs resources that have already been implemented at the university. I plan to introduce legislation that expands vital resources like the A.S. Food Bank, as well as a bill providing stronger protections and resources for all students facing housing insecurity both on and off-campus.","My platform focuses on outreach and addressing the needs of the student body by working directly with the student population. With many students feeling unrepresented and unheard this year, I hope to be a voice for all students, both within and outside of the College of Creative Studies. My goals will be achieved through cooperation with other students in the senate and a narrow focus on getting the work done, with no room for self-interest or bureaucratic games. My successful senate term will provide students with the resources they ask for and representation for those who have felt unheard.","This year, in particular, many campus organizations have expressed a feeling of disconnection with the Senate. I hope to foster a direct relationship with the vital campus organizations that desire change and progress for the campus community. A.S. entities such as the Commission on Disability Equality (CODE), IVTU, The Food Bank, and Black Womyn's Health Collaborative are just a few organizations that I look forward to working with.","Accessibility is very important to me, and it is particularly important for the needs of constituents. I believe holding frequent office hours as a Senator is an important duty, but having additional remote accessibility (such as over Zoom) is equally important. I'm hopeful that hosting casual CCS ""town hall"" meetings where students can express concerns and ideas will make constituents interested and excited about what is happening in the A.S. Senate.","Beyond spending 3 years thus far studying in CCS, I care for the well-being of my peers and the world around me. I have developed connections with students and organizations I would have never predicted, and feel more motivated than ever to create legitimate positive change for every student at UCSB. As a public university, I believe we must continue to make progress and represent an institution for the people, by the people. While this year's Senate has not been committed to this goal, I believe my election to this position will reinvigorate this commitment within the entire Senate and beyond.",Left-leaning,Very Poor,Yes,"As a Jewish progressive, this issue is dear to my heart. I am proudly anti-zionist and advocate for the liberation of all peoples, including all Palestinians living in occupied Palestine. Divesting our student funds from war is a key part of this movement toward collective liberation.",Yes,"I believe that education is a human right and should not be limited by a financial barrier. Beyond this, UCSB is a public university that already funds many students' educations through financial aid such as scholarships and grants. Free and quality education should be a possibility for everyone, regardless of meritocracy.","No, I do not believe mental health services at UCSB are adequate. CAPS is unable to serve the vast number of students who require and deserve quality mental health care despite how much the program is promoted. We must expand and improve this program to fit the needs of the large student population at UCSB.","I am familiar with the university's Title IX office, but I feel there is more work to be done to support survivors. The university must actively dismantle institutions that allow for assault to occur, particularly those affiliated with the university both on and off campus property. Additionally, I hope to work on expanding safety resources for students so that constituents can feel protected against assault without calling the police, which can sometimes do more harm than good for survivors.","I do not believe UCSB effectively serves historically underrepresented groups. The university chastises underrepresented groups for speaking out against injustice while simultaneously utilizing underrepresented groups to present a facade of diversity. Despite being a Hispanic-serving institution, many Latine students report frequent instances of discrimination and discomfort in classrooms and in the campus community. Black, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ students face harassment and discrimination on and off campus despite the university's claims of progressiveness and equality. The university administration and government have a duty to serve these historically underrepresented groups and actively dismantle the conditions that produce discomfort and discrimination.","Despite the current inaccessibility, I believe that frequent emails, social media presence, infographics, and individual outreach will make a world of difference to involve the student body and keep them informed about Senate activities.","The Senate should represent the diverse beliefs of the student body while also advocating for and uplifting students. While the Senate does not have a responsibility to dictate the political and social beliefs of constituents, it does have a responsibility to act on behalf of the student body and support them. The Senate has done neither this year, which is the bare minimum for appropriate behavior during such a difficult time of suffering and crisis. Particularly, the Senate has an obligation to reach out to students and organizations who may be experiencing heightened suffering during this time, as well as protect students whose safety may be at higher risk due to their identity. ","Beyond refusing to take accountability, the 74th Senate made a mockery of the tragic doxxing of several students who were affiliated with the MCC. The President reposted the doxxing on public social media and later even admitted to not reaching out to the individuals who were doxxed or offering so much as an apology. The behavior of the A.S. government during and after this incident was embarrassing and unprofessional. As a Senator, I would have focused on de-escalation and protecting individuals who might have been at the most risk for retaliation, such as the individuals who were doxxed. My priority would have been keeping the MCC, which was not responsible for the signs, running, as it is a crucial campus space for so many students. Finally, I would have facilitated important community meetings for gathering and healing, as well as presented definitions and differentiations between anti-semitism and anti-zionism, which was wrongfully conflated by A.S. in the aftermath of the incident."
Paolo Daniele Brinderson,,Off-Campus Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/26133448/Paolo-Brinderson.jpg,,He/Him,3rd,Political Science,,,"Genocide. I am done watching Palestinians be murdered and feeling complicit. Seeing the world operate as usual while Gazans have to witness hell is unnerving. The way in which our government and administration refers to it as ""the conflict in the Middle East"" sounds like something out of 1984. Its despicable that UCSB is the only UC that has not divested from murder and something needs to be done about it. I am not unique in my valuing of Palestinian lives and I am proud to be running with many other candidates who support the same thing but it feels like I am just doing the bare minimum really. ","My most important experience has been as a DSP Test Proctor for 2 years now. It has allowed me to give back to the school and help students that need it the most. It also gives me the opportunity to witness how much students struggle taking the enormous exams professors pass off as ""normal"". I think working for disabled students has greatly enhanced my perspectives on the needs of the student body becuase they struggle with tasks able bodied students might describe as routine. This new perspective, I think, has allowed me to be much more empathetic and attuned to needs other than my own. I also frequent protests and pride myself on giving a voice to the voiceless with the goal of using my position of privilege to help those without.","Divestment: according to the Daily Nexus, ""UCSB cumulatively received investments of over $3 million in the 2022-23 fiscal year alone from various defense companies that are actively supplying U.S. machinery to the state of Israel."" Passing a resolution, like every other UC has,  would allow us to avoid complicancy in ethnic-cleansing. 

Condemn the suspension of the Restorative Justice Program by Santa Barbara County Sheriff over Deltopia weekend: This was done without consultation from the student body and underscores the controlling relationship police (without college degrees) continue to seek with our student body

Recommend the University recognize the Student Dining Labor Union - UAW: The Daily Nexus reported on Feb. 29 that the ""UC Refuses to Recognize UCSB Student Dining Labor Union"". I have witnessed the working conditions of our student dining workers and it is completely atrocious. Students work long, demanding shifts with little compensation and often with creepy bosses who treat them as disposable. UC must recognize the right for student workers, as with all workers, to unionize and protect themselves from predatory bosses and ridiculous workloads.","I seek an anti-racist campus without discrimination or hatred that goes out of its way to care for each and every one of its students. For me this means denouncing hateful and bigoted ideologies like Zionism while making sure all marginalized students have unencumbered access to places they can safely practice their identity. It also means improving administrative culture. UCSB is a large public institution with a very high student to faculty ratio which in my experience, gives the administration the excuse to treat its students like shit. UCSB does not offer enough housing, classes, and general support to its student body. By leaving students scrambling for resources they should have provided itself the university gets to wash its hands of any wrongdoing while leaving campus divided and bitter.","Students for Justice in Palestine, Jewish Voice for Peace, Black Student Union, El Congreso, Cops off Campus, SDLU-UAW, Muslim Student Association, Queer Trans Leadership Council, and more generally all entities dedicated to making our students safe","I can always be reached at my email Pbrinderson@ucsb.edu or on my instagram @pbrinderson, I will try to be available and respondent when I am not in class. I am more than willing to meet with any student about any issue that is plaguing them and will do my best to address their needs. Beyond my personal modes of communication I want AS to be more open and honest towards its students which I expect, to have the benefit of students  being more willing to voice their complaints to AS.","I am passionate, driven, and solution oriented. I think the best candidate is Dan Siddiqui, but I am deeply committed to creating a more thoughtful and inclusive campus. I am an outsider to AS and that comes with challenges but it also comes with new perspectives and no animosity towards other AS members. The Senate is large and I want to foster a communicative relationship with my fellow candidates with that in mind it just doesn't seem right to call myself the ""best"" candidate but I think I am highly qualified, inquisitive, and determined to improve the abysmal student environment. ",Left-leaning,Poor,Yes,This is the issue that got me interested in running for Senate in the first place and it is dispicable that we accept money from any corporation that profits from war,Yes,I think public education should be available to everyone in the public regardless of wealth or income. In addition the government must also ensure enriching careers for the larger amount of students entering college once it is free so that a college degree doesn't get watered-down into a highschool diploma.,"No, I think the largest problem plaguing the mental health of UCSB students are UCSB professors and the housing/cost of living crisis in Isla Vista. The University offers students experience burnout, anxiety, depression, etc. by offering counseling instead of combating the root issue of our students' mental anguish. Of course not all mental health issues come from material circumstances but I don't doubt that a large amount of the student body is frequently put in poor mental health via issues directly related to the University. I point the finger at overdemaning professors and our housing/cost of living crisis. I think the University must give a mental health training and require professors have conciliatory grading/deadline options for students as well as ensuring that all of its students have adequate housing before claiming that it offers adequate mental health services.","I am familiar with the Title IX office and its functions to protect students and employees safe from sexual discrimination, harassment and assault. It is clear that the university cares about victims of assault and so they must do more to support victims. According to RAINN only 20% of female college students report their assault, it should not be a mystery why this is. Universities across the US, including our own, do not take victims seriously regardless of their gender identity. While I hope more than 20% of victims at UCSB report their assault there is no reason to believe this is the case.","No. With many other issues encountered in this questionnaire, the University claims that it represents the needs of disparaged groups but often takes action that explicitly goes against their needs and interests. I would provide the closing of the MCC as one of the many examples of the University ignoring the needs of queer students and students of color. ","Most students do not perceive AS. Largely because they don’t need to, but also lack of outreach. I find most students hear about AS when they make a headline in the Nexus, headlines that are frequently negative.  This is a shame because AS offers students important resources. We just need greater outreach via flyering, a more updated website, and a greater social media presence. I want to increase outreach to the student body via greater advertising of meetings and services. The AS offers important services that could be crucial to a student’s time here but they have to know about it. The Student Advocate general, for example, I had never heard about before running but potentially be game-changing for students victimized by admin.
","The Senate must stand with Palestinians as they face slaughter from American manufactured bombs, guns, and missiles by divesting from the corporations that provide these instruments of enthic-cleansing. This may seem like ""taking sides"" to some but it is really standing up for injustice something that must be done in Palestine but also across the world from Ukraine, to the Congo, Sudan, and Myanmar. The Senate must communicate that any rhetoric to continue the funding of Israel's genocidal campaign is hateful. It must also that students who support Israel must do so in a way that is not islamophobic in the same way that students who support palestine must do so in a way that is not anti-semitic.","The 74th Senate did not handle the situation, the University stepped in and decided what would happen instead. The University ""handled"" the situation by suspending the MCC and releasing a ""non-statement"" to the student body ""condemning all forms of hate"". Ironically enough I think what the University did was incredibly hateful. By closing one of the only places on campus open specifically for students of color, on a campus that is much whiter than the rest of the state, the University continued the marginalization and victimization of POC that has underscored their history in this country. The University claims it is unbiased and takes no sides but by acceding to zionist demands in the face of Palestinian genocide the University has clearly taken a side. The 74th Senate did not do enough to stand up for students of color when the MCC was closed meanwhile I participated in protest in the Black Studies department and sent a very strongly worded email in response to Chancellor Yang's ""non-statement"". As a Senator I would have supported the protestors and denounced any escalation of or outside intervention in the situation. "
Alexa Butler,,Letters and Science Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/26133421/Alexa-Butler.jpg,,She/they ,3rd,Black Studies ,,,"Hi, my name is Alexa Butler. I am driven to be a senator because I am passionate about being a catalyst for change. I believe in the power of advocacy and the importance of amplifying diverse voices within our student body. As a senator, I see an opportunity to make a meaningful impact and ensure that every student's voice is heard and valued. I am committed to serving with grace and dignity, and I am confident that my experience and dedication will enable me to effectively represent the interests of our student body. I am eager to work collaboratively with my peers to address pressing issues, advocate for positive change, and create a more inclusive and equitable campus community. ","I am currently a tour guide with the Gaucho Tour Association, I am Co-Chair of (BWHC) Black Women's Health Collaborative, I am mentor with (UMP) Undergraduate Mentor Program.As Co-Chair of the Black Women's Health Collaborative (BWHC), I have been deeply engaged in serving not only my board but also the entire black student population at UCSB. Through my two-year membership with BWHC, I have gained valuable experience in navigating the intricacies of student advocacy and leadership within our campus community. My role as Co-Chair has allowed me to amplify the voices of marginalized students and lead initiatives that address the needs and challenges faced by black students on campus. As a liaison to senators, I have effectively communicated the concerns and priorities of our community, advocating for resolutions that promote equity and inclusivity. I have also spoken at Senate meetings on behalf of both my organization and myself as a student, ensuring that our voices are heard and represented in important discussions. Additionally, I have organized and facilitated collaborations with other Recognized Campus Organizations (RCOs), fostering a sense of unity and solidarity among diverse student groups. With my experience and readiness to hit the ground running, I am prepared to contribute effectively to the Associated Students Senate and continue advocating for the diverse student body at UCSB.","In my upcoming term, I have identified several critical areas where legislative action is urgently needed. Firstly, I am committed to Divest resolution, recognizing UCSB's position as the only UC yet to divest. This resolution aims to ensure that our institution's investments are aligned with ethical principles by divesting from entities complicit in war and weapons manufacturing. 

Secondly, I will advocate for a resolution condemning the actions of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the U.S. government's involvement in ongoing conflicts.

Furthermore, I am passionate about addressing historical injustices faced by indigenous communities. To this end, I will propose a bill aimed at returning stolen artifacts housed in the Humanities and Social Sciences Building (HSSB) to the Chumash people.

Lastly, I believe it is imperative to promote diversity and representation within our student government. As such, I will draft a resolution mandating that the A.S. Senate includes at least one Black senator annually, ensuring that the voices and perspectives of Black students are heard and valued in our decision-making processes.","In the Associated Students and at UCSB, I envision several key changes that reflect my commitment to equity, justice, and inclusivity. Firstly, I advocate for increased representation of Black individuals, especially Black women, in leadership positions within the Associated Students and across campus. This includes promoting diversity in decision-making bodies to ensure that the voices and perspectives of marginalized communities are heard and valued.

Secondly, I strongly support the implementation of resolutions aligned with the principles of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. It is essential for UCSB to divest from institutions complicit genocide and to take a stand against injustice in Palestine. By aligning with BDS principles, UCSB can demonstrate its commitment to social justice, and global solidarity.

Furthermore, I advocate for creating a campus environment that prioritizes the safety and well-being of all students, faculty, and staff. As someone who has personally felt unsafe on campus due to instances of discrimination and harassment, I understand the importance of fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect where everyone feels valued, supported, and empowered to thrive academically and personally. It also entails addressing systemic issues of discrimination, harassment, and violence to ensure that every member of the UCSB community can pursue their educational goals without fear or safety concerns.
","As a senator, I aim to build collaborative relationships with a wide range of multicultural organizations committed to advocacy and solidarity. Building on existing partnerships, such as those with BCU's (A.S. Board Commissioned Units) like BWHC, SCORE, CODE, EJA, and EAB. I recognize the importance of engaging with a diverse array of Registered Campus Organizations (RCOs) to ensure that the needs and priorities of all student groups are addressed. Some examples of the impactful organizations I hope to collaborate with include BSU, SJP, CSA, NSA, NSBE, Mujer, and CPOD.I am committed to being accessible and responsive to their concerns, actively working together to advance both my platform and their respective goals.","During my term, I'm committed to being accessible to my constituents both remotely and in-person. I view my constituents as integral members of my team, and building strong relationships with them is key to our success. I'll establish various communication channels to ensure continuous interaction, such as regular office hours, virtual meetings, and social media platforms. By actively participating in multiple initiatives alongside my constituents, we can collaborate effectively and address issues together.","I aspire to bring a fresh perspective to the A.S. Senate, with a deep-seated passion for outreach, advocacy, and learning, particularly in serving marginalized communities. My desire to represent both my campus and hometown stems from a commitment to ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Currently, I feel underrepresented by the existing A.S. Senate, and I believe my insights and contributions can bridge this gap. I am eager to engage in Senate proceedings, advocating for resolutions that promote inclusivity, equity, and the well-being of every student.

Moreover, I am driven to be a senator because I am passionate about being a catalyst for change. My experience in drafting and championing the anti-blackness bill demonstrates my commitment to addressing pressing issues and effecting positive change. With only a few weeks left in the academic year, I recognize the urgency of the situation and am prepared to hit the ground running. My familiarity with legal code and Senate procedures, coupled with my readiness to quickly acclimate myself to the board, will enable me to effectively contribute from day one. I am confident that my dedication, experience, and enthusiasm make me the ideal candidate to represent the interests of our student body in the A.S. Senate.

Overall, my diverse leadership experiences have equipped me with the skills, passion, and determination to advocate for positive change within the Associated Students and UCSB community. I'm eager to bring my unique perspective and unwavering dedication to the table as a senator, striving to create a campus environment where every student feels safe, valued, and empowered to succeed.
",Left-leaning,Poor,Yes,"I would  vote in favor of a resolution to divest. It's incredibly frustrating that UCSB is the last UC to take this essential step, which highlights a disregard for the interests of our students, particularly BIPOC students. Divesting is not just a priority for me; it's my FIRST platform. If candidates do not prioritize divestment, then they should not even be considered for office. I refuse to let my tuition dollars contribute to genocide. We should all have a say in where our money goes, and divestment is a crucial step towards ensuring our funds align with our values.",Yes,"I believe that UCSB should be tuition-free. The burden of tuition places  financial strain on young adults, particularly those from marginalized groups, and perpetuates neoliberal forces that exacerbate socioeconomic disparities. It's unjust that brilliant students at UCSB are deterred from pursuing higher education due to the looming debt upon graduation. Education is a fundamental human right, and no one should be saddled with exorbitant tuition fees as a barrier to accessing knowledge and opportunity. A tuition-free UCSB would not only level the playing field but also empower students to pursue their academic passions without the burden of financial insecurity."," I believe UCSB's mental health services could be enhanced to better support students. While CAPS offers valuable resources, there's a need for increased staffing and accessibility. If elected, I'll prioritize relieving CAPS' workload and initiating conversations about mental health across campus. It's crucial to address the specific needs of BIPOC students and combat misconceptions surrounding mental health in marginalized communities. By fostering open dialogue and expanding support networks, we can create a campus environment where every student feels empowered to prioritize their mental well-being.","The university's Title IX office plays a crucial role in addressing cases of sexual assault on campus. To better support survivors, I believe we need to streamline communication channels and ensure that the office is staffed with trained professionals, particularly women who can empathetically handle these sensitive situations. Immediate access to mental health services should be provided to survivors as soon as they come forward, and the entire process should be conducted at the survivor's pace, prioritizing their well-being and comfort. Ultimately, the Title IX office must prioritize supporting and serving survivors above all else.","Definitely not, as a first-generation Black lesbian woman I have not felt welcomed or served at UCSB. This institution does not serve marginalized groups. They attempt to be neutral with centrist ideologies, but that is not how equity works. If UCSB served black or any minority students, then a current A.S. Senator would not have voted NO to condemn Anti-Blackness. If UCSB cared for marginalized groups we would have DIVESTED. If UCSB's Administration cared about black and brown students the MCC would have never been shut down. UCSB has issues when attempting to serve BIPOC students, they don't do it and don't know how. If elected I promise how we are treated and how we feel at UCSB will change. The active ongoing issues of racism, anti-blackness, and harassment will not be ignored anymore. I'm tired of my identities and all marginalized identities are not catered for here. We need more BIPOC voices in A.S. Things can't change until there is effective representation.","As a senator, I'll prioritize accessibility and transparency to bridge the gap between A.S. and the student body. I'll establish weekly office hours and keep my physical and virtual spaces open for comments and questions. Additionally, I'll maintain an active presence on campus, engaging with students during tours, classes, and events. Communication channels will include social media, email newsletters, and in-person discussions. By being approachable and available, I aim to ensure that students feel informed, heard, and empowered to engage with Senate activities","This year, the Senate's handling of division surrounding Israel and Palestine was unacceptable. Personal biases and ideologies overshadowed constructive discussion, leading to abuse of power and hostility. If elected, I'll prioritize clear, professional communication, ensuring all voices are heard, especially those most affected by the issue. Senate must serve as a platform for respectful dialogue and meaningful action, fostering understanding and unity rather than division.","Incidents of  targeting and abuse to students leaders coincide with the tenure of the A.S. first pro temp and President, raising concerns about the punitive, unprofessional, and disrespectful nature of their leadership. It is evident that their actions have been influenced by anti-black sentiment, which is deeply concerning and unacceptable. 

The  targeting of the MCC, a sanctuary for marginalized voices, is a reminder of the forces of oppression we face. Instead of celebrating our inclusivity, the MCC has been vilified and branded as anti-Semitic. This deliberate mischaracterization erases the voices of black and brown bodies, perpetuating harmful schemation and further marginalizing our communities.

The MCC is more than just a physical space—it is a lifeline for many who go unrecognized at UCSB. Yet, it has become an environment , marred by vandalism, repression, and violence against BIPOC student workers. Zionists, emboldened by their privilege, desecrated this sanctuary, while black and brown bodies were unjustly cast as aggressors.

The MCC, once a symbol of  resilience, has been reduced to a viral media stunt, its student workers doxed and ostracized for speaking their truth.—our administration, our professional staff, our A.S. president—all have failed us in our time of need.

This egregious injustice cannot be ignored. The closure of the MCC, and the administration's failure to address the abuse and suppression faced by BIPOC students, is a clear example of systemic neoliberal practices and anti-blackness. It is a blatant attempt to silence our voices and erase our presence on campus.

Isabella McClintock,,Transfer Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/26133426/Isabella-McClintock.jpg,,She/Her,3rd ,Sociology,,,"I am running to be a senator in the 75th student senate to represent my fellow transfer students. As someone who has undergone the transition from community college to UCSB I understand the barriers transfer students face, including financial, educational, and social barriers. I want to be a voice for students who are integrating themselves into the greater UCSB community. I want to advocate not only for people who went from high school to community college and to university, but transfers who took any path to get to UCSB, including transfers from other universities, non-traditional/returning transfers, older transfers, and transfer students who are parents. ","I am currently the chair of the Transfer Student Alliance and have rebuilt the board from an inactive board to one that is fully operational within one quarter. Through TSA I have created a coalition with the Transfer Student Center and have passed funding requests to have collaborative events for transfers that foster community and increase outreach for campus resources. I also spend my free time working at the A.S. Pardall Center to further serve students within the Isla Vista community, a resource for students that offers free printing, computer usage, covid tests, and works closely in collaboration with the Legal Resource Center, Isla Vista Tenants Union, UCIV group, and IVCRC. In addition, I am a member of the UCSB Panhellenic community as a member of Gamma Phi Beta and have connections to outreach through the Greek community about campus events. ","I want to propose an amendment to the current legal code to expand the Transfer student seat since there is currently only one representative for the 33% of the undergraduate population that is transfer students. Transfers are currently being underrepresented and are in need of more advocacy when it comes to their perspective having a seat at the table when decisions about university life are being made. I want to propose a bill to administration about allowing Transfer students to reside in unused graduate student housing in the San Clemente Villages since there is a lack of safe and affordable housing for second year transfer students. Thirdly, I want to increase the minimum wage of student jobs on campus to $20/hour, since student employees are limited to 36 hours of work per paycheck at only $16/hour, students living below the poverty line are not earning a livable wage on top of university expenses. ","My platform is built on outreach, inclusion, representation and community. My time in office some of the goals I want to achieve include increasing the number of Transfer Senators, raising the student minimum wage to one that is livable, since many students do not have access to off campus jobs that provide better pay. I want to increase the accessibility to affordable mental health care, which means increasing the number of mental health care providers through CAPS to reduce wait times, and to allow students without health insurance a place to seek help without going into debt. Lastly, I want to work with administration to allow unused graduate student housing in the San Clemente villages to be allocated to housing insecure undergraduate students. All students should be allowed access to safe and affordable housing, and there should be no student left unhoused if there is leftover housing going unused. ","Some of the organizations I hope to work with in order to achieve my platforms includes continuing to work in conjunction with the Transfer Student Alliance, the Transfer Student Center, the Pardall Center, and the Isla Vista Tenants Union. In addition, I hope to work with the Commission on Student Well Being, the Public and Mental Health Commission to increase student access to mental health services that are affordable. I hope to work with Thrive and the Basic Needs Committee to have outreach to Transfer students who are unaware of the services such as loaner computers, cooking classes, and CalFresh workshops. I hope to work with my fellow senators and admin to pass resolutions for more affordable housing, and more transfer student representation on the senate. ","I will make myself available during my term as a senator by holding regular office hours both in person and online via zoom for students who are unable to meet in-person or who rely on accessibility tools that online platforms such as zoom provides. In addition I plan to hold quarterly or monthly town halls for Transfer students to relay their concerns and grievances about campus or community life. This way I will be able to be an active member of the senate who hears out student concerns and ensures that I am accurately representing and serving student needs. I will not be a senator who does not take their constituents into consideration, especially dealing with budget allocations that are funded directly from students pockets. I will follow the Brown act, releasing my agenda to the public before senate meetings are held to ensure transparency and to build trust within the students I serve.","I am the best candidate for the position because of my experience, skills in leadership, and genuine desire to help make campus an environment that students can thrive in. As the chair of an AS board, I already understand the intricacies of working within Associates Students from my current position in the Transfer Student Alliance. In addition to my experience at UCSB, I have worked in leadership positions since my time at community college where I was a senate liaison for my CC's student senate, and intern at the Student and Faculty Political Action Committee and volunteer at VIDA (Vasconcellos Institute for Democracy in Action) that lobbied in Sacramento for funding to community colleges to become have tuition free. In addition I am extremely passionate about Transfer student success and want to make UCSB a place where all Transfers feel welcome and supported by their community to not only further their education but grow as an individual in our school. ",Left-leaning,Very Poor,Yes,Our University should be a place that fosters growth and education. UCSB has no place in war or in genocide. We must divest. ,Yes,Higher education should be free. Nobody should have to put themselves into debt just to survive in our society. Universities should not be profiting off of students who are trying to better their chances at making a living within our economy.  ,"I believe that the student mental health services are not adequately fulfilling the needs of the student population as a whole. I think that CAPS is a stepping stone to what needs to be available for sufficient mental health care. I believe that the mental health services are overrun by students seeking help, with not enough staff to meet the demand. I know that referrals are offered for students who are not getting frequent enough care, but health insurance and transportation to off campus mental health care is not guaranteed for every student. I think that funding to expand the amount of providers needs to be made to make up for the demand of students that is currently not being met. ",,,"In question six I detailed the ways I would be accessible for students to report their grievances through town halls. During these, I will report out about what is happening within the senate to increase awareness and transparency. I will also advocate for more accessible senate meetings, such as ensuring there is a zoom option that adequately represents the meeting with clear audio and visuals. I would like to do outreach through the Daily Nexus or through KCSB, giving reports regularly to ensure our student press/media is aware of the inside happenings of senate. Most importantly, I will hold my fellow senators and student representatives accountable for doing the same. If a student representative is not willing to include and increase accessibility to the students they are serving, they should not be in office and I will make sure that if they fail to do so that it will be brought to the student body's attention. ",Senate's role during this time is to listen to the students they represent and understand their concerns and critiques. The senate should not be a platform for senators to express their individual self serving claims that are unrelated to the UCSB student population. Senate needs to increase their transparency to students trying to access their representatives. Senate needs to increase access to their office hours both in person and remote so they can successfully communicate with the student body they are representing. ,"The senate should have prioritized the safety and wellbeing of black and brown students who use the MCC as a place they feel comfortable on campus. The 74th senate severely let down the peers that they represent and should have put aside any political differences and start meaningful conversations about how to solve the problem of students feeling unheard, rather than escalating the situation and even risking the safety of students through their online platforms. As a senator I would have started an emergency town hall meeting for students within the MCC and other organizations to speak and to come up with solutions together."
Alex Arambula,,On-Campus Senator,,,He/She/They,Second,Applied Mathematics,,,"Every year the On-Campus Senator position is underfilled, only getting about one or two candidates every year (like this year!) of a total number of five. Students living in on-campus housing deserve a right to be adequately represented in the student government, and I aim to champion their voices into the wider Associated Students Senate.","I have been involved with my own hall council in Anacapa, KCSB (in both Sports and Archives), and UCSB's Anime Club. Through these, I have interacted and worked with several different kinds of people that go here, especially those who reside on campus. KCSB Archives in particular has allowed me access to archives that involve past Senates and how they have handled current events at the time, which gave me a great insight and want to become a Senator now.","A first bill I'd like to propose would be to change the meal-swipe system to allow swipes to roll over from one week to another, another bill I'd like to propose would be to remove the requirement to buy a meal-plan when staying on campus (as several students have expressed wishes to not feel forced to eat school food), and a third bill would be to pave a bike lane between the library and the ILP to avoid pedestrian/bicyclist accidents.","I'm running on a platform of meal swipe reform and transparency between developers of the San Benito Housing Complex. The meal swipe system is antiquated and unintuitive, being less than ideal for incoming first-year students on campus. I would introduce bills to change the meal swipe system to make it more accessible to utilize and (if students wish) to avoid it. As for San Benito, what mired the Munger Hall was its lack of transparency and student input until it was too late, but I will work with the HDAE to update the Student Housing Development website to include more information as the project progresses and allow for students to submit their own feedback to the future campus housing complex so we can avoid the pitfalls of the cancelled Munger Hall.","I hope to work with Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE), the Resident Housing Association (RHA), and the residence halls on campus to further my platform to changing the meal swipe system and increasing student knowledge and voices of and in the Student Housing Development process, hopefully making both fair and equitable.","I will be available regularly for in-person office hours at any of the three RHA offices, or any residence hall on campus. For a more remote experience, my email will always be open for comments or questions. I hope to see and hear from several on-campus residents in the 2024-2025 school year!","I have lived on campus for both of my school years here at UCSB, and I have worked with several residents and RHA in the past to better understand the populace of people living on campus. Additionally, my initiative in running for this office that so few others would is a testament to my willingness to serve the on-campus student body even if others consider this position ""cursed"".",Left-leaning,Poor,Yes,UCSB has more pressing issues than funding war criminals.,Yes,Education should be a human right.,"While I believe that the mental health services at UCSB are adequate for short-term therapeutic care, they tend to suffer with students who need longer-term care. UCSB should hire more professionals that are capable of providing individual long-term support for students suffering from mental difficulties that can't be easily solved through group sessions or workshops, but rather a program tailored specifically for them to get them to a better place mentally.","Title IX at UCSB nowadays seems equivalent to the Human Resources department at a company; it serves to UCSB and its image but not the students who allege misgivings people in power. There needs to be a fundamental reshaping of Title IX to focus on a victim-first mentality that gives alleged victims of harm from people in power the resources and confidence they need to get through such a horrific event, rather than trying to do damage-control to protect the image of abusers. ","As a bisexual Latine myself, I can only effectively comment on those two communities. For the LGBTQ+ community, while I think the campus offers a lot of events and safe spaces for queer people, it does very little to combat the pervasive homophobic and transphobic rhetoric of several students on campus who think their harmless ""jokes"" aren't harmful to students of those sexual and gender identities. As for Latines, El Centro has been threatened year after year by UCSB to either cut their funding or shrink their already dwindling presence on campus, effectively trying to cut out a major source of gathering for Hispanic students in a purportedly proud Hispanic-Serving Institution.","I would try to make by presence as an On-Campus Senator known to just about every student living in the residence halls at UCSB, allowing myself to be a source of knowledge for the first- and second-year students residing on campus, making it so they both understand the role of A.S. and learn ways for themselves to get involved in the student government, as well as how the student government is serving them. ",The Senate's role during this time is to try to quell the division of students at UCSB and act as a place where students share their views to their respective senators in a fair and democratic manner so that said senators can act in accordance with their constituents' beliefs and confidently explain how they are moving forward and why in relation to their constituents' remarks.,"The 74th Senate should have gone after those who were doxing others and appropriately saw to it that they were punished appropriately. If I were a Senator, I would have simply allowed those on both sides who sought more destructive and violent means of conveying their message to be appropriately punished for their unacceptable behavior, not just turn a blind eye to the misdeeds of those who agree with me."
Yasmine Suuck ,,Off-Campus Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/26133455/Yasmine-Suuck.jpg,,She/Her,2nd ,Political Science,,,I am running for A.S. senate because I am passionate about advocating for students and I feel I can make a difference in the organization. Currently A.S. is entrenched in various scandals increasing tensions between students on campus. I believe I can be a voice for students that feel marginalized as well as act as a vehicle for more cooperation. Without a functioning Senate students no longer have advocates. I am here to be your voice and ensure that you have someone constantly working to expand resources for student needs. ,"My involvement as an employee, member of various clubs, and students has prepared me for this position. I am a part of Campus Democrats which has allowed me to talk to students especially through voter registration during the midterm elections and year-round. My involvement with the Labor Caucus also allowed me to engage with workers on campus as well as in the Santa Barbara area that are fighting for better working conditions. I understand the challenges students face while trying to hold a part time job and being a full time student. I am determined to make your voices heard. 
","During my term I would like to work on helping students with housing, basic needs, and accessibility. Our university has not built adequate housing to accommodate our growing population. By engaging with students and university administrators I hope to alleviate the stressors surrounding housing. I also want to help students achieve better basic needs resources as living in Santa Barbara is very costly. This includes increasing funding for the A.S. Food bank which many students depend on for food security. Finally I want to work with A.S. as a whole to increase transparency and comprehensibility of the many resources this organization offers. ","My platform is to prioritize students and increase transparency in A.S.. Ultimately, the Senate is supposed to act for students and without students understanding the actions of the Senate it is no longer a truly representative organization. I will continue to talk to students about their goals and interests and bring them to the Senate to be discussed. I will work as hard as I can and engage with organizations and other senators to help our campus community. I also want to help students make the most of their tuition and fee spending at the university. This means expanding resources such as helping with the cost of living. I will also continue to connect students with these resources and make them easier to access. ",I would like to work with any organization that is interested in creating joint resolutions and bills. I am also interested in working with A.S. groups including the Trans and Queer commission and the Student commission on Racial Equity. Additionally I want to work with the IV tenants union in order to continue advocating for students in the current housing crisis. ,During my term I will make myself available always through email and instagram and respond in a timely manner. I will also host in person and zoom office hours for students that want to voice their concerns with me directly. Additionally for students that are intimidated by engaging with their elected candidates I am hoping to create a google form for students to fill out with any  concerns they may have or issues they would like to see the Senate deal with. ,I believe my commitment to hearing the voices of students as well as creating a more engaging senate makes me the best candidate for this position. I understand the struggle many students face with getting resources from A.S. as well as frustration around where my tuition money is being spent in the organization. I am not running to serve a personal agenda but to be a true representation of the student population. ,Left-leaning,Poor,Yes,"UCSB is an academic institution and it has no place in supporting companies that are actively engaging with death on the Gaza strip. A resolution from the Senate, I believe, would be very impactful and represent the interests of many students. ",No,"I believe that UCSB should have reasonable tuition in order to provide the best education for its students. I think tuition should be lowered, especially keeping in mind that we are a state university that is purposefully created to be more accessible to all students. ","I believe that mental health services including CAPS are vital for students at UCSB. I do however think that there needs to be a continuous improvement of this entity as our student population grows. I know students that have faced problems with scheduling an appointment, communicating with their providers, and switching providers when necessary. Mental health on campus is crucial for students and continuing to keep up resources can have a large impact on our community. ","I am familiar with the Title IX office and its role in supporting individuals who have experienced sexual assault or discrimination. I commend UCSB for its continued support of the office and its comprehensive website/platform for people to use. I think certain students may still be unfamiliar with the office so continuing to make the office a known resource could help students who have experienced sexual assault have an opportunity to seek justice. 
","I think we could be doing more to support students in historically underrepresented groups. UCSB has been making strides forward and continues to support organizations and events helping minority students. With this being said I know some students have felt marginalized and have experienced hate speech based on their identity. Continuing to educate ourselves, increase resources, and defend these students is vital in creating a better campus climate. 
","
The accessibility of A.S. is one of the key reasons why I am running this year. I will keep students informed through my personal contact and online presence. I will also work with A.S. on developing projects and events targeting students. 
","I have witnessed the division and hostility on campus and I believe that the Senate has a crucial role in mitigating this conflict. The Senate should represent the views of its constituents while also continuing to provide bills supporting other student needs. I believe Senators during a highly divisive time should always check in with students and ensure that they are hearing all of their voices, not just the voices they agree with. Continuing direct conversations with students and telling them about the complex processes of the Senate I believe will increase transparency and help to overcome division. 
","The 74th Senate had to deal with a very complex issue as well as a divided student body. It is easy to critique the Senate now and I want to recognize the work that many Senators have done to help represent students and solve the issues that were arising. I believe the suspension of the MCC for such an extended period of time neglects the needs of many students that use the MCC. The center holds many resources for marginalized students and continuing to restrict access has an immense impact on these students. The closing does not help in furthering discussion and punishes students who were not involved. I also think the Senate could have also engaged more with students, especially the students that were doxxed, instead of closing the MCC"
Ivan Hernandez,,Transfer Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/26133430/Ivan-hernandez.jpg,,He/Him,Junior,Computer Science,,,"I am enthusiastically running to be a part of UCSB’s 75th senate because I am deeply passionate about creating positive change within our school community. My primary goal is to serve as a dedicated advocate for our transfer students, ensuring that their voices are not only heard but also uplifted and prioritized in the decision-making processes of our student government. 
It's no secret that many of our fellow students feel a sense of disconnection from our current A.S. Senate, particularly due to its lack of support for underserved students and other marginalized communities. This sentiment underscores the urgent need for representation that genuinely reflects the diversity and unique challenges faced by our student body. As a candidate, I am committed to addressing this disparity by actively engaging with and amplifying the concerns of transfer students, and advocating for policies and initiatives that promote inclusivity, equity, and accessibility for all members of our community. 
Over the years, I have served in a wide variety of leadership roles in my school community and beyond. For example, I served as A.S. President at Diablo Valley College, Student Trustee for the Contra Costa District, and Vice President at the Student Senate for California Community Colleges (SSCCC), which serves as the state-wide student government association representing over 2 million California community college students. These positions have helped me understand the A.S. system, and how to make a difference in our community effectively.
By fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment, I believe we can truly enhance the overall student experience and create a campus community where every individual feels valued and empowered to succeed.
","
As a transfer student, getting involved on campus and in Isla Vista can be challenging. However, I have found a passion for advocacy and uplifting the voices of those historically silenced. During my time at Diablo Valley College (DVC), I was fortunate to serve in different leadership positions at the college, district, state, and federal levels. I served as the outspoken person at my college, representing thousands of students in the decision-making spaces. 

With this experience, I got selected as one of two Pearman Fellows under the office of the External Vice President for State-wide Affairs (EVPSA). As a fellow, I have engaged in many areas of the EVPSA office such as University and Legislative Affairs. In these two committees, I’ve helped represent the transfer community, and have brought to light the different struggles transfer students face at UCSB.

I’ve learned the needs of our students through different town halls, committee meetings, and other student-led organizations. Moreover, I am an active member at Lobby Corp which focuses on the legislative aspect of UCSB, where I have been selected to attend legislative conferences at the state and federal level, representing the transfer community. 

Through my active involvement at the EVPSA Office and Lobby Corp, and my previous involvement in A.S. at my Community College, I feel beyond confident that I can bring experience to the senate seat and represent our uniquely diverse transfer community.
","As transfer senator, I aim to prioritize the introduction of a variety of resolutions, bills, and petitions to address the pressing needs of UCSB's transfer student community. Among the top priorities are:
1. Increased Housing Support: One of the primary challenges facing transfer students is securing affordable and convenient housing options. I will advocate for the expansion of on-campus housing specifically designated for transfer students, ensuring that they have access to safe, affordable, and supportive living arrangements.
2. Transfer Student Representation: It's essential to amplify the voices of transfer students within campus leadership and decision-making bodies. I will push for increased representation of transfer students in key committees, councils, and student government positions, ensuring that their unique perspectives and experiences are taken into account when shaping campus policies and initiatives.
3. Financial Aid Transparency: Many transfer students face uncertainty and confusion regarding financial aid processes and resources. I will work to enhance transparency in financial aid information, making sure that transfer students have access to clear and comprehensive details about available scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial assistance.
In addition to advocating for new initiatives, I will also focus on revising existing policies and legislation to better serve the needs of UCSB's transfer student population. For instance, while the current senate structure includes only one transfer senator, I strongly believe that additional representation is necessary to adequately address the diverse needs and concerns of transfer students. By working collaboratively with campus stakeholders and using the collective power of the student body, I am committed to leading these initiatives and creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for transfer students at UCSB.","My platform is split into four main areas:
1. Priority housing for Transfer Students: Although UCSB supports transfers, we need to do more. If elected, I will push for resolutions that ensure the administration prioritizes transfer student housing.
2. Reducing Student Fees: UCSB is expensive, with tuition costs rising annually. If elected, I'll work closely with UCSA and the Transfer Student Alliance to fight for lower tuition and more financial aid for transfer students.
3. Improving Student Health & Wellness: Transferring to a new school is challenging. Leaving behind friends, adjusting to the quarter system, finding housing, and dealing with high living costs can impact our mental and physical health. That's why promoting student health and wellness is a top priority for me.
4. Advocating for Fair Parking Fees: Many transfer students commute to school daily, facing high transportation costs such as high parking fees. I will advocate for fair and accessible commuting fees to make travel more affordable for our students.
I am committed to working with everyone to create policies and initiatives that put UCSB's transfer students first. By forming partnerships, encouraging open discussions, and taking decisive steps, I am confident we can make real progress and cultivate a campus that fully supports and includes all transfer students.
","As the transfer representative, one of my main goals is to bring light to the different resources we have at UCSB for our incoming and returning transfer students. Therefore, I plan to work and collaborate actively with many on-campus organizations. With that said, I would love to collaborate with our A.S entities such as EVPSA and EVPLA offices to create initiatives that are focused on uplifting the needs of our transfer students, and help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for them. Moreover, I plan to work with EOP, different academic departments, cultural organizations, and the Undocumented Student Services to reach students of all backgrounds, connect with them on their needs, and assess them through what they believe will most benefit other students. Additionally, I hope to form relationships with the Isla Vista Community Service District and other off-campus organizations to support the transfer community on and off campus.","As your next senator, I will make myself available to all my constituents by holding office hours and making my social media and email readily accessible to everyone. My office hours will be both remote and in-person to create accessibility to everyone. Moreover, I plan on actively collaborating with the Transfer Student Alliance (TSA), and the Transfer Student Center (TSC) on student-led initiatives that positive support our transfer community. My goal is to create a sense of belonging with our transfer students and hear from them, answer questions, and bring their perspectives to the senate meetings. Lastly, I am aware that not all students are part of TSA and TSC, hence, I will proactively reach out to AS board committees and student organizations, and attend their meetings to establish an open line of communication with myself, and the student population at large.","I believe my prior experience in Associated Students (A.S.) sets me apart from other candidates. For instance, I served as A.S. President at Diablo Valley College and Student Trustee for the Contra Costa District. Additionally, I held the role of Vice President at the Student Senate for California Community Colleges (SSCCC), representing over 2 million California community college students statewide. Furthermore, my exposure as a Pearman Fellow under the Office of the External Vice President for State-wide Affairs (EVPSA) provided valuable insight into the A.S. structure at UCSB and deepened my understanding of our institutional challenges and potential solutions. Lastly, my involvement in UCSB Lobby Corp allowed me to advocate at the state and federal levels on behalf of UCSB as a transfer student. I aim to use this diverse experience to truthfully represent the transfer student community in the Senate.",Left-leaning,Poor,Yes,"I would support a resolution to divest because divesting from these companies sends a powerful message about the university's stance against human rights abuses and atrocities. It aligns with the institution's role as a responsible global citizen and promotes social responsibility. Investing in companies directly or indirectly involved in genocide contradicts the university's values and ethical principles. It goes against the fundamental commitment to human rights and social justice. That is why, I would vote yes to divestment. ",Yes,"While the majority of UCSB’s profit comes from student fees, I truly believe the university should demand more funding from the state and federal governments. UCSB claims to be an inclusive and equitable place for all students, however, only those who can afford to pay can attend UCSB, and those who don’t have the resources are often forced to quit education. UCSB should be tuition-free to strive towards a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive institution for ALL.","It's crucial to emphasize the inadequacy of current mental health services at UCSB and the urgent need for improvement. While CAPS serves as a valuable resource, its capacity is far from sufficient to meet the growing demand for mental health support on campus. With a rapidly increasing student population, the counseling center is often overwhelmed and unable to provide timely or adequate care to all students in need.

One of the primary limitations of CAPS is its lack of long-term services, leaving many students without access to ongoing counseling or therapy. This not only hinders students' ability to address and manage their mental health concerns effectively but also prevents them from reaching their full academic and personal potential. The absence of long-term support options exacerbates the strain on CAPS and perpetuates a cycle of inadequate care.

To address these shortcomings, it's essential to advocate for the expansion of mental health resources at UCSB. This includes increasing staffing levels at CAPS to reduce wait times and improve accessibility, as well as allocating additional funds to support the implementation of new programs and services aimed at promoting student well-being.

Furthermore, efforts should be made to diversify the range of mental health support options available to students, including peer support groups, workshops, and community-based interventions. By offering a more comprehensive and inclusive array of services, UCSB can better meet the diverse needs of its student body and foster a campus culture that prioritizes mental health and well-being.
","Yes, I am familiar with UCSB’s Title IX office and its functions. I believe UCSB can enhance its survivor services by creating access to comprehensive support services, including counseling, advocacy, and medical assistance, tailored to their individual needs and preferences. Moreover, UCSB should streamline reporting processes, provide clear and accessible information about available resources, and enhance training for university staff and faculty to effectively respond to reports of sexual assault with sensitivity and compassion. Lastly, UCSB shall empower survivors to participate in decision-making processes related to campus policies and procedures on sexual assault and create opportunities for survivors to share their experiences and advocate for change within the university community.","As a member of multiple marginalized communities, I believe UCSB can significantly improve its support for historically underrepresented groups. Many students at UCSB, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds, face significant financial struggles, which can make higher education feel like an unattainable privilege rather than a fundamental right. While some faculty members offer support, this support must become a collective effort across all departments and organizations. Underrepresented students often lack the same level of preparation and academic readiness as their peers due to systemic barriers and inequities in education. Therefore, faculty support plays a critical role in leveling the playing field and ensuring these students have the resources they need to succeed. While the majority of faculty members are welcoming and supportive, the lack of diversity among them can create a sense of disconnect for underrepresented students. Increasing diversity among faculty and staff is essential not only for representation but also for fostering a more inclusive and supportive campus environment where all students feel valued and supported in their academic journey.","As the Transfer senator, I strongly advocate for transparency and student engagement within the Senate. It's essential that our student body is informed about the decisions made by the Senate, here’s how I would do it:
1. Firstly, I plan to organize regular town hall meetings that are open to all students. These meetings will provide a direct platform for students to interact with the Senate, voice their concerns, ask questions, and provide feedback on A.S. initiatives. By fostering open dialogue, we can ensure that student voices are heard and considered in Senate meetings.
2. Additionally, I recognize the importance of using various communication channels to keep students informed about Senate activities. I will collaborate with clubs and organizations on campus to disseminate information, utilize social media platforms to share updates, and send out newsletters and email updates to reach a broader audience. Through these channels, students will receive timely updates about Senate decisions, upcoming events, and opportunities for involvement.
3. From a Senate perspective, I am committed to promoting transparency by ensuring that meeting agendas, minutes, and voting records are easily accessible to all students. By making this information readily available, students can track Senate actions and hold their representatives accountable for their decisions.
In essence, I aim to create an inclusive Senate environment where all students feel represented and empowered to participate in shaping the future of our campus community. By prioritizing transparency and student engagement, I believe we can build a stronger and more cohesive UCSB community.
","It is truly disheartening to witness the division and hostility within our UCSB community, particularly concerning the Israel-Palestine conflict. In these difficult times, the Senate must take proactive measures to foster dialogue, understanding, and reconciliation among students.
To address this issue, the Senate should actively engage with its constituents by organizing various forums, panel discussions, and moderated debates dedicated to promoting understanding and mutual respect regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. These platforms would provide students with opportunities to express their perspectives, engage in constructive dialogue, and gain insights from diverse viewpoints.
Furthermore, the Senate must reaffirm its commitment to inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all members of the campus community, irrespective of their views on the conflict. It is crucial to create an environment where students feel safe expressing their opinions without the fear of harassment or intimidation. By upholding these values, the Senate can contribute to fostering a culture of open-mindedness and tolerance on campus.
In addition to facilitating discussions, the Senate should collaborate with relevant campus departments and organizations to provide educational resources, workshops, and events that delve into the historical, political, and cultural dimensions of the Israel-Palestine conflict. These initiatives would not only enhance students' understanding of the complexities surrounding the issue but also promote empathy, critical thinking, and informed decision-making.
Overall, it is essential for the Senate to take proactive steps in addressing the division and hostility within our community by fostering dialogue, reaffirming its commitment to inclusivity, and providing educational opportunities to promote understanding and respect.","While I respect the hard work of the 74th Senate and understand the gravity of the situation impacting student wellbeing, I believe their response to the MCC closure was disproportionate. While the comments made towards President Veksler were concerning, the immediate shutdown of the MCC seemed extreme, especially considering there was no concrete evidence linking MCC student workers to the incident. Throughout this challenging time, the Senate's actions appeared disjointed, possibly influenced by individual beliefs rather than a collective effort to address the issue constructively. As elected representatives of UCSB, their actions should prioritize the well-being of all students. Unfortunately, their approach made things worse instead of solving them. As a senator, I would have advocated for open dialogue instead of punitive measures. While acknowledging the seriousness of the situation, I believe there were missed opportunities for collaboration with campus resources like CAPS and the Office of Student Conduct. By fostering communication and providing support, we could have addressed security concerns while ensuring the continued wellbeing of all students.

It has prepared me with the knowledge of how important it is to pull our student fees from corporations desecrating the environment and profiting off of human rights violations.," A Bill to Divest from Corporations Violating Human Rights, A Resolution to Introduce an Un-documented Senator Seat, A Resolution to Have Guaranteed Housing for International Students for the first 2 years.","I am mainly concerned with housing as it is something I struggled with a lot on this campus. UCSB has more than enough accommodations available given how many rooms are left empty in the dorms. International students are unable to occupy cheaper housing in Isla Vista as we do not have social security numbers. Finding housing in Goleta makes transportation hard for international students, most of whom do not have cars. UCSB admits more people than it can house, it is then its responsibility to provide housing. UCSB is already being sued for not building required housing. I would pass a resolution to push for guaranteed housing for international students for at least 2 years.","I want to work with programs like UCSB Rapid Re-housing Program to make finding housing easier, A.S. Food Bank to make a greater variety of basic food items and personal hygiene amenities available for the student body.",I would hold hybrid (in person and zoom options) office hours to meet one-on-one with my constituents as well as work with campus and community organizations to reach out to the student body.,"Having experience of what it feels like to engage with A.S.

I am confident in my ability to bring sustainable change because of my experience organizing at UCSB.",Left-leaning,Very Poor,Yes,"I would absolutely vote in favor of a BDS resolution. There is a reason other UC's have voted in favor of it: the university is a place for knowledge and should endeavor towards academic research, not profiting off of dropping bombs on children.",Yes,"Yes, I believe UCSB, as an institution in the endeavor of knowledge should be free. I understand that it takes resources to provide the quality education we get, but most of our student fees is not going towards improving the academic lives of the student body, but is instead being invested in companies that manufacture weapons and missiles.",,"Yes, I am familiar with the university's Title IX office and its functions. Clearly, from the articles published by the Nexus itself, the process is bureaucratic and unkind to survivors who have to constantly face delays and there are no repercussions from those who commit these offenses. The University can start to support survivors by actually supporting survivors. The hypocrisy of having compulsory SA training for everyone in which the university re-assures its ability to provide justice when those in power have gone unchecked and are running to gain more power is insane. The university is complicit is making UCSB an unsafe environment by its inaction.","No, I do not believe UCSB is effectively serving historically under-represented groups. There is a lot of anti-blackness on campus and in Senate. UCSB is supposed to be an HSI but there is neglect on behalf of the institution towards that role. Housing insecurity is so high and disproportionately affects historically underrepresented groups. Moreover, the unchecked abuse of power and bureaucratic delay that students who have faced harassment at the hands of individuals in power.","A.S. Senate's repeated stance of not making a zoom option readily available or de-legitimizing the people trying to make public comment via zoom is the reason it remains so inaccessible. An important way to make the meets more accessible and accommodative is having a regular zoom option. And I feel the need to stress this, the meeting does not start unless the zoom does too.","The role of A.S. Senate is to reflect the student body that votes it into existence and the student body is currently unhoused, facing food insecurity and harassment form administration and people misusing their power in senate. Israel-Palestine is not an issue far-removed form us, 20 million dollars of our money is going to weapon manufacturers profiting off of genocide. A.S. Senate should divest and work to re-invest the money in improving the living conditions for its student body. ","The 74th Senate's handling of the events at MCC was inadequate and insensitive. After President Veksler doxxed students of color on her social media, the Senate tried to circumvent the process to call a recall election by calling the meeting on zoom but then telling other people about an in-person meeting and trying to de-legitimize the former, more accommodative set-up. The racism of doxxing students of color was not discussed. President Veksler's irresponsibility and lack of accountability as a President of the entire student body was not discussed. If it were up to me, I would have had the meeting follow due process and not try to argue that a petition with 3 times the required numbers was illegitimate."

Feedback would be regularly reviewed during Senate meetings, ensuring that student voices are heard and considered in decision-making processes.","During this time of division and hostility among students concerning the Israel-Palestine issue, the Senate's role should be one of a peacemaker, aiming to calm tensions and foster a peaceful campus environment.

Communication from the Senate should be frequent, transparent, and inclusive, emphasizing unity and the common values of respect and understanding. Instead of taking sides or making statements that could exacerbate the situation, the Senate should focus on activities and communications that promote dialogue, mutual respect, and understanding among the student body.","I believe the signage resulted in community backlash as many signs targeted people specifically and said things like “You can run but you cannot hide”.

If we want to see change, we must act. I have no plans to ever run for any government, but after seeing injustice constantly being perpetuated, I need to make the change I want to see. ","I have been involved in Associated Students for almost a year as the BCU Liaison for the A.S. Commission on Culture, Arts, and Joy Justice.

2) A proper bill to properly address, define, and condemn islamophobia, antisemitism, and xenophobia on and off-campus.
3) Allocation of funding to promote a safe and healthy UCSB by purchasing masks, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant wipes to all major lecture halls and classrooms. These supplies would be distributed to students, but not required, for free. ","My platform is to call and act for the justice that desperately needs to be served for BIPOC students.

","I am familiar with the Title IX office and its functions on campus, but as a whole the university needs to do a LOT more to support survivors of sexual assault and harassment. The Title IX office can only investigate claims within the scope of their jurisdiction, and if they are unable to further work on a case it is usually met as a dead end.

I would encourage my fellow senators to hold public forums in addition to official senate meetings and provide a space for students to come forward and express their needs as our constituents. ","During this time the Senate needs to stay representative of ALL students, however, should not amplify voices with intentions of hate or oppression of others. No one's comfort should come at the cost of another's, and even though talking about the ongoing genocide of Palestine and its people is seen as ""complicated"" to some, we cannot allow our university to continue its contributions to military contracting and war.

One of this year's senators has claimed that Students for Justice in Palestine ""supports Islamic terrorism"", but has provided no examples nor gave his definition of ""Islamic terrorism"". Members of senate have abused their power to push a narrative that they were ""victimized"" by signage and have built massive online followings and doing brand deals with their new-found followings, which is completely unacceptable and inappropriate. As well as silencing minority-led student groups, the senate has blatantly shown their biases. 
If I were senator when this took place, I would target the source of the problem: why were these signs placed in the MCC in the first place? Because students felt that their elected leaders were not listening to their needs for a ceasefire resolution and solidarity with the people of Palestine. "

Seeing the latest events that are happening in our school community, I have noticed the lack of representation, especially from our underserved communities, and how that has affected all of us. Hence, I want to contribute to making a difference and a positive impact in the lives of our students. I truly want to uplift the voices of our people, especially the voices of our underrepresented communities, and ensure that our voices are being heard and taken into account in any decision-making space. Furthermore, I would like to address why I am running specifically for University Owned Off-Campus Senator. I believe that one of the most crucial aspects of being a student is housing – and everything it implies, such as the experience we have while living away from home because of college. Being someone who lives in university-owned apartments, I have first-hand experience with what works and what has room to be improved. I am confident that I can contribute to enhancing the living conditions of our residents so that they have a pleasant experience while being at UCSB. I am committed to our community; I am committed to advocating for resources that address the needs of our students, and I am committed to creating a more comfortable and fulfilling environment for all residents. I believe in the importance of transparent governance, and thus, as a senator, I am dedicated to exerting every effort to guarantee that the student body of UCSB is served by a senate that diligently advocates for the interests and requirements of our campus community.","As a UC Santa Barbara student, I have had the opportunity to get involved in different roles and organizations around campus where I have applied what I know to advocate for and uplift the voices of our students while also learning more about what I can do to ensure the well being of our communities. For instance, I am currently part of the Associated Students – I serve as a Pearman Fellow under the Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA). As part of the EVPSA office, I sit in the Undergraduate Affairs and the Legislative divisions where I get to work toward getting more resources for our students and advocate for our needs while also representing our students in statewide affairs. Additionally, I am an active member of UCSB Lobby Corps (LC). Here, I have advocated for UCSB students to local representatives to ensure our concerns are being heard and ensure our needs are being met. Similarly, being in LC has given me the opportunity to practice Lobbying skills that are extremely helpful in raising the voices of my fellow students. Moreover, I served in the Student Apartments Community Council (SACC) as a Student Community Representative. Here, I have represented our University-owned apartment residents and have worked closely with them to ensure their living conditions are suitable for their success. All these positions, alongside my previous leadership experience, have prepared me to run for senate and have prepared me to take on the responsibilities that the role of A.S. senator entails.",--,"From previous experience in living in University-owned apartments, I can tell that there is a welcoming environment; nonetheless, I can also see that there is room for improvement, especially in ensuring the well-being of our residents, and thus, their success. As the University Owned Off-Campus Senator, my main focus will be on supporting our university-owned apartment residents by nurturing a sense of community and bringing support for their success. Hence, my platform consists of the following: First off, I am committed to enhancing communication between our university-owned apartment community and the Associated Students. I believe that for us to make a change, it is important that we have a line of communication between these two groups so that our residents know what A.S. is doing while also A.S. knows what the needs of our residents are. Secondly, I want to enhance communication and create a sense of community among the different community apartments we have on campus. This ensures a more welcoming environment for everyone and ensures the well-being of our residents. Thirdly, I plan to continue advocating for more student resources for our residents to ensure their continuous success. I believe that aspects such as basic needs and affordable housing are crucial to the well-being and success of our residents, and I am committed to bringing more resources to ensure our needs are addressed.","In order to achieve my platforms, I would be open to working with any campus organizations or entities interested in collaborating on the development and enactment of legislation. Additionally, I am looking forward to working closely with different organizations. Among these, I hope to collaborate with the Housing Operations Services to ensure that we make the accommodations necessary to improve the living conditions of our residents. Additionally, I want to collaborate with SACC to create that point of contact and that line of communication between A.S. and the university-owned off-campus residents. Similarly, I am eager to collaborate with other campus groups such as the A.S. Student Coalition on Racial Equity (A.S. SCORE), among others, to ensure equity and inclusion at all times. Lastly, I am looking forward to collaborating with the other offices of A.S. and with my fellow senators to ensure that we are holding each other accountable, that our senate is transparent, and that we meet our responsibilities in order to ensure that we are constantly advocating for the well-being of our UCSB students.","I believe that communication, honesty, and transparency play a vital role in representing a community. I believe that the best way to make sure that our people are being heard is by engaging with them, listening to them, and communicating their concerns to be able to address them. For this reason, I intend to make myself available to my constituents in any possible way. I will encourage my people to reach out to me either in person or remotely to voice their concerns, feedback, questions, or anything else they would like to communicate to me. Additionally, I intend to host accessible office hours where everyone can come and talk to me directly – in these, I plan to also provide updates and take note of any issues that need to be addressed so that I can create that sense of trust and bridge that gap of communication between our constituents and A.S.","I believe that my experience in previous leadership positions as well as my background and my passion for advocacy make me a strong candidate for the position of University Owned Off-Campus Senator. Being a first-generation college student, a woman in STEM, and part of an underrepresented community has encouraged me to raise my voice and advocate not only for myself but also for my people to make change happen. Thus, I have nurtured a strong commitment to advocating for and empowering the voices of those who can’t and those who have been silenced. Moreover, my active engagement in various leadership roles in different college organizations and the valuable experience I have acquired have continued to nurture my passion for uplifting the voices of our people and effecting positive change – which has equipped me for the responsibilities of this role. Roles such as the Vice President of Executive Affairs of the Associated Students of Diablo Valley College, Diablo Valley College Delegate for the Student Senator for California Community Colleges (SSCCC), and Vice President of Diablo Valley Rotaract – a non-profit organization –, among other leadership roles, have prepared me to represent our students and ensure that our people’s voices are heard, represented, and addressed.",Left-leaning,Poor,Yes,"I would vote yes for a resolution to divest from war because I believe it is our responsibility to stand against human rights violations. I believe investing in war is against human rights, and as a public university, investing in any form of violence or conflict does not align with the university’s values, ethics, and morals. The money the university receives from our students should be invested in their well-being and education.",Yes,"I believe that higher education, including UCSB, should be tuition-free because it would ensure education access to individuals, especially the ones who come from underrepresented communities. I understand that money plays a huge factor in delivering quality education to students and that it will take a long journey to achieve this goal; nonetheless, I believe that it is worth looking into state and federal grants and looking for legislation that helps with affordability.","While I appreciate UCSB’s efforts to bring mental health services to our students, I truly believe that there is still significantly a huge amount of work that needs to be done to improve our mental health services – especially for the well-being of our students. Something I believe we need to continue doing is to advocate for more funding to expand mental health services to ensure that these are within reach of students at all times. Additionally, advocating for more funding for hiring more staff for mental health services is crucial to ensure that students can access these services. Finally, I would also like to encourage the university to hire more staff who students identify with to give that sense of trust and make it easier for students to access these services – gives them that sense that they can come and use these services rather than coping on their own.","I believe that Title IX plays a vital role in offering support and resources to survivors of any form of sexual assault. Ensuring they receive the assistance and support they deserve is truly important. As a senator, I am committed to prioritizing sexual assault survivors voices, listening to their needs, and advocating for their rights. Similarly, I believe that the University should continue to allocate more resources toward education and prevention efforts to address sexual assault comprehensively.","To be honest, I believe that UCSB still has work to do in terms of representation and equity and serving historically underrepresented groups, especially concerning housing. – which is a glaring issue. Many students from these groups are disproportionately affected by the housing shortage and high costs, which further exacerbate existing inequalities. I believe it is imperative for the administration to take action and address these concerns while prioritizing the needs of marginalized communities to ensure equity and inclusion at all times.","As a senator, one of my main goals is to make A.S. more accessible and transparent to the student body. I want to help bridge the gap between A.S. and our school community. To achieve this, there are several things that I would like to implement. For instance, I am looking forward to being the direct line of communication between our University-owned off-campus residents and our student body association. Similar to this, I would like to open regular communication channels with our student body at large. Additionally, I would implement office hours where students can drop by to ask questions, share concerns, or provide feedback directly to me. Furthermore, I would add town hall meetings and student input on agendas to ensure that A.S. is taking into consideration the needs of our constituents. Lastly, I would also implement outreach events to engage students from diverse backgrounds and communities. This would help build relationships and foster trust between students and Senate representatives. By implementing these specific steps, I aim to enhance student involvement and transparency within A.S., ultimately ensuring that the Senate effectively represents and serves the interests of the student body.","During these times of divisions and hostility on campus, it is crucial for the Senate to play a unifying role on campus. I believe that the Senate should strive to foster open and respectful dialogue among students with different perspectives. In addition, the Senate should prioritize the well-being and safety of all students. Regarding communication, the Senate should be transparent and inclusive. They should regularly communicate updates, statements, and resources related to the Israel-Palestine situation via multiple channels, such as email newsletters, social media platforms, and in-person meetings. It's important for the Senate to actively listen to the concerns and perspectives of their constituents, acknowledge the complexity of the issue, and demonstrate a commitment to addressing student needs and promoting a safe and inclusive campus environment for all.","While I acknowledge the situation and understand that posting the signage was not correct, I believe that closing the Multicultural Center (MCC) was inadequate. The MCC plays a pivotal role for many students from different cultures, and, while understanding that posting signage against the current president Veksler and other individuals should not have happened, the truth is that closing the MCC affected communities that did not have anything to do with the incident and led students to feel unsafe in what they would call their safe space. As a Senator, I would have approached the situation with a focus on dialogue, understanding, and community support. Additionally, I would work to foster a campus climate that values diversity of thought and respectful discourse, while upholding the principles of inclusivity and social justice."
Enri Lala,,Off-Campus Senator,,,he/him,2nd,History & Global Studies,,,"I am running to contribute practical solutions to the issues we all face. My first priority is the housing crisis, with which I have the most experience. As president of YouthBridge Housing, I have advocated for impactful housing solutions at the campus and statewide level. As Senator, I will hold the administration accountable for completing San Benito, the project set to replace Munger Hall and ensure that over-enrollment does not burden students’ housing rights. I will continue the 74th Senate’s work to ensure bluff safety, a pressing issue which must be addressed comprehensively. 

I was recently elected president of Ethics Bowl, the competitive philosophy debate team that placed second in the nation at this year’s competition. My time with the team has exposed me to the myriad issues competitive teams and RCOs face to access school funding and support. I am committed to reforming this process by expanding which clubs can access funding and setting out clearer criteria for when it can be accessed.

Last but certainly not least, I will use my YouthBridge experience to build closer connections between our student government, nonprofits and local government doing vital work in Santa Barbara County. I believe students want to be involved in the major crises facing our communities, from homelessness to childhood poverty and beyond. We need to make opportunities to get involved in this work much more accessible. This approach would benefit both our campus and the broader community around us.","Each of my platform points is informed by deep experience in and around campus. My practical approach to housing has been built through involvement both in the housing crisis impacting students and the homelessness crisis prevalent throughout the state. My work has included organizing town halls to gather student opinions on the San Benito project and leading a delegation of students advocating for pro-student housing legislation at the California State Capitol. As Senator, I will use this experience to effectively advocate for students’ interests and implement their input.

My Ethics Bowl experience has been similarly valuable, by developing my leadership and communication skills and granting me an understanding of the issues RCOs face in accessing funding and support. This will make me an apt advocate for the thousands of students who dedicate their time to clubs throughout our campus. From political interest clubs to those representing our school in competitions around the country, it is necessary that our student government provides everything these orgs need to pursue their missions.

Just as importantly, I have extensive experience inside AS. Serving as Communications Director has taught me the most effective means of promoting the Association's vital resources and events. Earlier this quarter, I was one of two lead organizers who brought back the previously defunct yearly Associated Students Olympics. The event brought students from various offices and BCUs together in a spirit of cooperation. This experience will enable me to fulfill my duties as Senator while helping improve campus climate.","As soon as I take office, I will begin work on legislation committing the Administration to  completing the San Benito project within already communicated deadlines and according to student needs. This will serve to reverse the process that led us to Munger Hall, in which students were not consulted about issues which affect them directly.

Secondly, I aim to introduce legislation reversing the exemption of non-academic competitive teams from accessing AS funds. I believe that all clubs made up of fee-paying undergraduates should be able to access these funds. Even deeper reforms are needed, including ones allowing students to access funds without initially paying for travel and other expenses on their own.

Thirdly, I will work to advance already existing work to secure our bluffs and honor the students who have lost their lives in the previous few decades. Ensuring that no more lives are unnecessarily lost in this way is integral to students’ housing rights. This loss of life is unacceptable and we must intensify collaboration with local government until the tragic issue is one of the past.","My platform revolves around the three aforementioned issues: housing, reforming campus org funding and connecting our campus to service opportunities in SB County. To accomplish these practical goals, I will collaborate closely with all colleagues, regardless of our differences. Collaboration with organizations doing vital work, be they AS entities, in IV or local government throughout Santa Barbara, will be just as crucial to accomplishing this mission. I will remain attentive to student input on my initiatives throughout the term, particularly on issues with such direct impact as housing and campus org funding.","I plan to continue collaborating with the organizations doing incredible work on the housing and homelessness crises, both in IV and throughout Santa Barbara County. These include numerous campus orgs, the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and nonprofits like DignityMoves and PATH.
I will closely collaborate with competitive teams and other RCOs to ensure that AS is fulfilling its duties. As I see it, the issue can largely be attributed to insufficient communication between AS and the organizations it funds. With this in mind, I vow to communicate closely with my fellow RCO leaders.","You can contact me through Instagram (@enri.lala) or email (enrilala@ucsb.edu). Once set, I will make my office hours widely accessible. My commitment to making AS more accessible goes well beyond this. I will help organize and participate in town hall-style events outside of regular Senate hours – be they as casual as bringing snacks to the Arbor or off-campus or more formally organized town halls – which bring student government directly to students, enabling them to participate in the process.

We must enable students to participate in the Senate’s public forum without the added pressure of entering a tense environment. Such steps include sharing educational information on what speaking at public forum entails far and wide as well as considering a virtual or written option, which would take the pressure of public speaking off of students’ shoulders.","I have the experience and vision needed in the Senate. While understanding that the housing crisis cannot be transformed overnight, my experience has taught me what practical solutions will be most effective – and how integral student leaders are to this effort. I have the background necessary to advocate for your interests on this vital issue.

My Ethics Bowl experience has developed many of the skills needed in the Senate. Collaborating to figure out ethically sound solutions to real issues and communicating with top colleges from around the country has taught me the value of effective communication.

Finally, my extensive AS experience will enable me to hit the ground running in the Senate, where knowledge of the Association’s internal functions is crucial.","In the context of AS, I have learned that evaluating individual policies is most effective. ","I believe important initiatives were pursued this term, namely those in support of maintaining Student Health and improving bluff safety. These were, however, overshadowed by tensions entirely unrelated to the advancement of students’ interests. As Senator, I vow to remain committed to pursuing the student population’s business and helping build a much healthier and more productive campus climate.",No,"The conflict requires a long-term political solution and I strongly support the right of self-determination for both peoples. I am concerned that such measures, if not precisely defined, will go beyond the armaments industry and into regular companies in Israel, ranging from the agricultural to tourism sectors, on which workers – including over 2 million Palestinians! – depend for their livelihoods. Clearly, the UC ought not invest in the armaments industry. I reserve concerns, however, about the scope of such boycotts and their consequences on the ground.",No,"I strongly believe that no student should be driven away from applying to or attending UCSB because of the cost. This can be achieved by offering need and merit-based aid, including full-ride scholarships, to as many students as possible, which would encourage equity and fairness. For this to be achieved, however, we have to consider the full picture. This means that those with the financial means to pay, in-part or in-full, should do so as far as they are capable. Though I would agree with the proposition that some of what is covered through tuition could be funded by the state or federal government, it is in part these tuition funds which provide the experience and education we enjoy on campus.","As UCSB’s student population has grown over the years, the Administration has often fallen short of providing the resources to match it. This is reflected in the unacceptable wait times students seeking to access these resources often face.
As Senator, I will work to continue the vital work of the Temporary Committee on Mental Health formed in the 74th Senate. The Committee made vital progress in communicating students needs to the Administration, including practical steps to reducing wait times. I will work to continue these crucial conversations and pass legislation that was not addressed this year.","I have read up on the Title IX office and its crucial services, all based on ensuring students receive fair treatment regardless of gender, including in cases of sexual assault and harassment. As Senator, I will strongly support the expansion of organizations doing vital work, such as UCSB CARE, Students Against Sexual Assault and Take Back the Night. I believe the combined resources of administration and campus organizations, coupled with higher awareness among students is crucial to making our campus safer and more inclusive.","We can do more. As a History student, I am proud to be part of a campus which recognizes the historical injustices that surround us. However, I believe it is time for us to go beyond mere recognition. These efforts should include collaborating with leaders of the Band of Chumash people, actively providing resources that represent the voices of Black students and other communities integral to our campus.

This year’s difficulties have also highlighted the importance of combating the two ills of antisemitism and Islamophobia. I believe my unique perspective, immigrating to the US from Albania at eleven, will enable me to contribute to these vital conversations. I vow to remain open-minded and attentive to student voices throughout this process, acknowledging that broad participation is required if we are to make real progress.","As I see it, the issue is quite simple. AS organizes vital resources and events, which are hard to access by students. It has also been associated with controversies which hinder its ability to fulfill its duty, which receive much attention. This status quo needs to be reversed.

My extensive AS experience has helped me develop the necessary skill set to address this issue. My work revolved largely around coordinating and promoting the events and resources that make AS valuable. As Senator, I will work to expand and maintain the Senate's online resources, its website and social media accounts.

It is crucial to bring the Senate closer to students, by hosting office hours at the Arbor and IV and making it easier for students to speak at public forum. In this way, we will maximize AS’ positive impacts on campus life and slowly tear down the barriers dividing it from students.","A senator is ultimately elected by and for the student body. Yes, everyone, elected officials included, is entitled to their personal opinion but the guiding question to every decision should be: how will this affect the students I represent? I vow to work with students and colleagues regardless of their views to advance the platform points I've detailed above and ensure we fulfill our duties. We must provide a platform for students to express their opinions all the while continuing the vital regular work of student government.","Protecting students’ safety, ability to pursue their education and make their voices heard is a student leader’s primary responsibility. As a Senator in such a difficult environment which saw all of these basic rights challenged, I would have stood against actions that endanger or target students – regardless of their beliefs.

On a more fundamental level, the climate around AS devolved to a level that made vital government functions impossible. My experience communicating and coordinating AS vital resources and events has equipped me to de-escalate this climate and get the Senate back to working on issues that can improve life on campus."
Eemaan Wahidullah,,Off-Campus Senator,,,She/her,First-year,Pre-biology,,,"I’m running for off-campus senator because I'm dedicated to standing up for voices that aren’t being heard at our university. Our campus I've noticed is full of diverse perspectives, however those who are marginalized or silenced don’t have a say in the decisions that affect them. Many of these are my friends, yet I see them struggling without the support they need to succeed. It’s my duty to be their advocate and ensure they feel valued and respected on campus. 

As a first-year student, I’ve noticed that important issues like financial insecurity, housing, and employment aren’t being addressed effectively. It feels wrong that these issues are being ignored, especially when our university is investing in things like warfare instead of supporting its own community. That’s why I’m committed to divesting from harmful practices and investing in the well-being of our campus. 

My goal as off-campus senator is to express the voices of marginalized groups, whether they’re people of color, women, religious minorities, undocumented students, or others who aren’t being represented. Together, we can create a more inclusive and supportive university environment for everyone.","As a first-year student, I've actively engaged in various projects in order to support marginalized communities both on campus and in Isla Vista. Through my involvement in clubs like MSA and SJP, I strive to foster representation and solidarity among diverse groups. I extend my support to all clubs and organizations that my peers are part of, broadening my understanding of UCSB's community.

Beyond campus, I've authored poetry books and children's novels aimed at promoting diversity and embracing differences. My work I feel reflects my commitment to providing inclusive narratives for children as well as giving back to the community and for it to grow as well. Additionally I've established a non-profit organization dedicated to aiding Afghan communities, which stems from me wanting to support as a first-generation Afghan-American myself.

Living in Goleta has given me with a deep understanding of the marginalized voices within our local community. I'm dedicated to amplifying the voices I've learned and addressing their needs. Through active engagement and caring support, I aim to identify and fulfill the needs of all groups who feel underrepresented on campus, ensuring that UCSB is a place where everyone feels valued and supported.","During my first year, I aim to introduce multiple resolutions and bills that prioritize the needs of various groups and places within UCSB. One of my key focuses will be on supporting and funding religious rights for all communities on campus. This includes initiatives to ensure access to halal and kosher food options, as well as the establishment of dedicated prayer spaces for individuals of all faiths. These measures are essential to meeting the basic needs of our diverse community and fostering a sense of connection and belonging around campus.

Additionally, I will work on addressing the basic needs of silenced groups which can be projected many ways. This may involve implementing policies to improve access to resources like housing, tuition assistance, and job opportunities, as well as increasing support for programs like CalFresh.

 I am committed to advocating for divestment from warfare and the redirection of funds towards initiatives that benefit students and the community. This includes investing in education, healthcare, and other essential services that contribute to the supportive care of our campus community.

Overall, my goal is to introduce legislation that promotes equity, and support for all minority groups, genders, and identities. By prioritizing the needs of these communities, we can work towards creating a campus environment where everyone feels valued and at home.","My platform is built on the foundation of kindness towards supporting my friends and genuine listening. With the continuous support of my friends and various campus groups, my approach centers on actively engaging with all community members to understand their perspectives and needs at UCSB. I firmly believe that true leadership comes on engaging to the voices of those who entrusted us with their support.

Reflecting on my first year at university, I've realized that fostering a supportive environment and being a safe place rather than wielding authority like a dictator can cause significant progress for overall progress towards change. It's about genuinely hearing people out, rather than succumbing to self-centered agendas.

During my term, I'll prioritize open communication and empathy, ensuring every individual feels valued and heard. By embracing this approach, I aim to bridge gaps, foster unity, and drive positive change within our community.","To achieve safety and support on campus, I aim to collaborate with various organizations and communities. I enjoy engaging with different groups, which helps me connect with specific organizations that can offer assistance. Currently, I'm involved with MSA and SJP, along with cultural and ethnic groups. Recognizing the marginalized voices on campus, like BSU, is crucial. Hearing the various voices I've notices It's one of the many marginalized voices on our campus, which motivates me hopefully to support their needs and amplify their voices.

Furthermore, I'm keen on supporting women's support groups and basic needs initiatives to enhance campus support systems. Collaborating with basic needs, financial offices, and housing departments is essential. Improving infrastructure and providing job opportunities can alleviate many student's and their stress in meeting their basic survival needs. This support enables students to focus more on their academic goals.

In essence, I'll continue expanding my network and connections on campus to foster a supportive environment for all students.","During my term, I aim to be highly accessible to all groups and voices, both remotely and in person throughout the 2024-2025 school year. I will prioritize open communication channels such as office hours, where anyone can reach out to discuss their concerns or ideas. Also I'm interested hopefully to be responsive to emails and actively schedule meetings to address any issues face-to-face. 

To ensure inclusiveness I will actively engage with social media platforms, providing updates and responding to questions or requests for virtual meetings. I understand the importance of being available to those who need support the most, and I am committed to making time for these groups. Overall, my goal is to be approachable and responsive to the needs of all constituents, regardless of the communication method they prefer.","What makes me the best candidate for this position is my deep understanding of the importance of representing all voices in our university community. As I explored UCSB during my first few months, I quickly noticed the lack of support for Muslim and Middle Eastern communities on campus. Being personally affected by this, I know firsthand how crucial it is to have someone who understands these issues represented in our student government. And understanding issues firsthand such as divesting from warfare and genocide.

Moreover, I've witnessed financial struggles among myself and my peers, with many of us barely able to afford housing and basic needs. Recognizing these gaps in support, I am committed to addressing them head-on. I have a clear understanding of the challenges students face regarding basic needs and tuition, as I have experienced them myself. 

By advocating for the needs of marginalized groups and addressing financial struggles, I can effectively represent the diverse needs of our student body. I am passionate about making positive changes on campus and ensuring that all students feel supported and represented.",Left-leaning,Poor,Yes,"If given the opportunity to vote on a resolution to divest from companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel, I’m in favor of agreeing. As a member of the Muslim community, I've witnessed firsthand the deep disrespect and discrimination inherent in supporting such companies. Choosing to invest in entities associated with mass genocide rather than divesting is not only disrespectful but also detrimental to the diverse groups within UCSB. It's unacceptable our campus, as the only UC without a formal divestment resolution, continues to financially support such atrocities. In order to truly uphold our values of education and community, we must divest from actions that perpetuate suffering and invest in initiatives that promote growth and unity.",Yes,"Yes, I believe UCSB should be tuition-free. Students shouldn't miss on various opportunities to succeed because they're struggling with basic needs and money concerns. Many face these challenges due to systemic issues, not their own fault and that they were given. Making tuition free would let students focus on their education without financial stress. This investment in our community ensures everyone has a chance to thrive, both academically and financially.","While UCSB has made steps in improving mental health services, there is still much room for enhancement. The current resources though helpful still lack meeting the diverse needs of students. To address this issue effectively, multiple steps should be taken.

First at hand they're needs to be increased financial support providing towards mental health services. This would enable the university to hire more counselors and staff, ensuring that students have timely access to support when needed.

Also it's crucial to make mental health resources more accessible. This can be achieved by implementing online counseling options, extending counseling center hours, and increasing outreach efforts to raise awareness about available services.

There should also be a focus on reducing wait times for students seeking assistance. Implementing strategies such as prioritizing urgent cases can help speed up processes and ensure that students receive timely care.

Overall, by investing in both financial resources and improving accessibility, UCSB can better support the mental health needs of its students, ultimately fostering a healthier and more successful academic environment.","Yes, I'm familiar with the Title IX office at universities, which deals with issues like gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct, including assault. To better support survivors of sexual assault, universities can enhance their services and prevention efforts. This starts with making sure the Title IX office has enough trained staff to offer compassionate support and resources. Prevention is extremely crucial too, whether through education programs about consent, healthy relationships, and how to intervene as a bystander. We could also if able center survivors in our approach, listening to their experiences and involving them in decisions in order to build empathetic approaches. Holding people accountable with clear reporting processes and disciplinary actions is crucial. And survivors should have ongoing mental health support that meets their needs. It's important for universities to keep improving and creating safer campuses for everyone.","I definitely feel that UCSB isn't effectively serving historically underrepresented groups, like the Black, Latine, Indigenous, LGBTQ+ community, and others. That's actually a big reason why I'm running as I've discussed some examples earlier. I see a lack of support for these groups, whether it's not addressing racism and harassment or not actively standing up for their rights. If those in positions of power, like the A.S. senate, aren't expressing the voices that need it most, then what's the point of their role initially if not this. We need leaders who are committed to creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all members of our university community, regardless of background or identity. That's why I'm determined to make a difference and advocate for the changes needed to ensure that everyone feels heard, valued, and respected at UCSB.","As a senator, my goal would be to bridge the gap between the student body and the Senate. I understand that many students see the Senate as distant and maybe even unapproachable. To change this perception, I would prioritize being more accessible and transparent in our actions.

I would make sure to utilize technology to enhance communication with students. Implementing user-friendly resources on my pages on social media about Senate activities, upcoming events, and ongoing initiatives would be essential. While also creating social media channels in general dedicated to Senate updates and interactions would allow for real-time engagement and feedback from students.

 I would encourage Senate members to actively engage with student organizations and attend their events. Building relationships with various student groups will help the Senate understand the diverse needs and interests of the student body, ultimately leading to more inclusive decision making and bringing awareness.

Overall my approach would focus on increasing transparency, accessibility, and engagement between the Senate and the student body. By implementing these specific steps, I am confident that we can create a more connected and informed campus community.","The current situation on campus regarding Israel and Palestine is causing a lot of division and hostility among students. I believe it's important for the A.S board to step in and address this issue right away. This is not only because I come from the Muslim community but also because it's a humanitarian problem. When students are so affected that it's causing tension and impacting campus life, it's crucial for the school's leaders to take action. The Senate needs to communicate openly and effectively with each other about how they're working to resolve this issue. It's about showing support, understanding, and a commitment to finding solutions that can bring the campus community together rather than further dividing it.","Regarding the 74th Senate's response, I believe there were missed opportunities for more proactive and effective management. As a Senator, I would have prioritized prevention through clear guidelines and communication beforehand. Ensuring that events are planned accordingly with university policies and fostering respectful dialogue could have deescalated tensions.

Also I would have advocated for swift and transparent communication with affected groups, addressing concerns and deescalating the situation. Collaborating with student groups and university officials to find constructive solutions would have been crucial in restoring trust and fostering a safe and inclusive campus environment.

Overall to summarize, while the handling of this situation fell short of expectations, proactive measures and collaboration could have created a more constructive resolution."""
