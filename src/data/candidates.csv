Ava Gurwitz,holly,College of Letters and Sciences Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13115208/220407-AvaGurwitz-SydneyHaupt.jpg,,she/her,second-year,Psych & Brain Science and Sociology,,,,"I am running to be a senator for the College of Letters and Science with the 73rd
senate because I have full confidence I will be able to accurately represent and
uplight the voices of the student body regarding pressing issues. A natural
divide already exists between the school administration and the student body,
especially after such a difficult period of remote education. This divide is only
further perpetuated when students do not feel their voices are being heard and
are unaware of the advocacy present and changes being made on their behalf. I
pride myself in my ability to communicate effectively not only to the
administration as a liaison between administration and the student body, but to
my peers so they feel closer to the happenings in the senate.","I believe that my work as a pearman fellow for Senator Megan Khobian gave me great insight into the processes in AS Senate, as well as introduced me to what was effective and changes that were desired in the 72nd senate so that I can carry on this work. Moreover, as the Vic President, Standards of Kappa Kappa Gamma, I understand the
collaboration necessary between executive officers to represent a large
scale chapter. Furthermore, in my position I not only plan events to bring
unity between the members, but I hold meetings where members can
come discuss completely confidential information. I have effectively
addressed the concerns of these members, held people accountable,
and also supported individuals going through incredibly traumatic
experiences. I also currently work as a behavioral therapist for a young
man with Autism. As a part of his team, we meet biweekly to discuss his
progress, suggest new ideas, and make new goals for him. I believe this
will effectively prepare me for the trial and error of proposing changes
within the 73rd senate.","1. I would like to provide more funding to UCSB career services and enact changes inthe structure of career advising. While the breadth of major options within thecollege of letters and science is great, it also leaves room for students to feel lost interms of what comes next post graduation. By providing more funds to the careercenter, this would enable additional hires and training for these career advisors,
 fostering an environment where students could develop a more personal relationship
 with these advisors and in turn receive more accurate and tailored advice.2. Another resolution I would introduce while in office would be to make DSPaccommodations more accessible for students. In a world where we are growing tobe more aware and accepting of neurodiversity and mental health issues, it isimportant that we make DSP more accommodating and a much better experiencefor students. From experience, it is a difficult enough thing to admit that you needhelp, so when that strength is demonstrated and help is not received it can feelincredibly shameful and frustrating.3. Provide more resources including information sessions and office hours/ accessibleappointments for academic planning. Other colleges at times may have more of aspecific path with required classes and such. Because of the variety in our college, itoften is hard to decipher what the best path is, especially due to the difficulty ofobtaining classes due to over enrollment issues.","As a senator for the College of Letters and Science with the 73rd senate,
I want students to find resources on campus to be much more
accessible and find them effective in meeting their needs. I want to
bridge the gaps of communication between Associated Students, UCSB
administration, and all students. Moreover, I want to transform academic
advising, DSP, and make schedule planning a process easier to
navigate.","I want to work with DSP (disabled students program), UCSB career
 services, CAPS, CODE, and the office of the registrar.","I will make myself available to the student body in a multitude of ways. Iwill establish office hours where students can come to me withquestions, suggestions, and anything they may need support with. If thatis difficult or not preferred for someone, I will open an anonymous formwhere students can submit any feedback and I can address thesecomments accordingly. I also want to be a friendly, approachable face oncampus, so I plan to establish a social media profile for senate mattersso students can associate a face with the name and feel comfortablehaving open discussions.","I believe I am truly the best candidate for this position for a variety ofreasons. First of all, I have extensive leadership experience, so I will beable to jump right in and start working on my goals. Moreover, I pridemyself on my ability to not only listen to my peers and extrapolate theissues that matter to others, but I am able to provide voices to those whomay be unheard. Growing up with a brother who has autism, I havealways considered myself to be a strong advocate for others and amtruly in my element when it comes to helping others amplify their voices.", Left-leaning,"Very good The 72nd senate effectively advocated for changes the
student body desired, provided outlets for the student body to vote and speak on issues that
mattered to them. An increase in the transparency between senate and the student body is one
aspect that could be enhanced in the 73rd senate.","No Divestment on campus is attached to a number of issues.
Questions of Human Rights, Inclusivity, and community well-being should all be considered.
Ultimately, I believe that a divestment resolution would have more negative effects than positive
on the UCSB community I aim to serve. We as a senate should aim to support and unite the
student body.","No No, while in the long term this would be ideal, these tuition cuts
 need to be initiated at a state and government level so that the school can still receive proper
 funding to give students the resources they need.","I do not believe that these mental health resources are adequate. CAPS is notoriously hard
 to get an appointment with and effective help from. It is great that these resources are in
 place, but they need to be restructured to make them more accessible so they actually help,
 rather than just being there for show. DSP also is framed in such a way that makes
 students feel abnormal for needing help and accommodations.","It is incredibly saddening to see how the university has addressed SA allegations. Educationgiven to students is also very methodical and does not give any sort of emotion to thesituation. It does not represent the weight of SA and the importance of consent andawareness. Survivors often feel incredibly unsupported by the university.","The university could first begin by actually holding individuals accountable for their
actions and amplifying the voices of survivors and supporting them. Sexual assault
resources are incredibly insufficient and many do not feel comfortable talkign to the
school due ot the lack of support many have received.","I believe that UCSB has certain initiatives that definitely should be acknowledged inaiming to effectively represent minority groups and create an inclusiveenvironment; however, there is still an immense amount of work to be done withinthe areas of inclusivity of minority groups. Furthermore, it is important to recognizethat we should not be content just because improvements have been made- it isimperative that all students regardless of how they identify, if they are apart of aminority group, or not, feel included and that they do not face any sort ofmicroagressions, discrimination, or anything to make minority groups feel set
apart.","If I am elected to serve on the 73rd Senate, the first resolution that I plan to propose
would be to increase the funding for academic advising in order to restructure it for
the benefit of the college of letters and science students. In this restructuring, I
would propose an additional hiring of qualified advisors, and having specific
advisors for different majors, years, and groups of students. I feel that this would
effectively allow for the students to develop more of a personal relationship with
their advisor, allowing more tailored and accurate advice for academics, and future
career advising.","Because AS is at times seen as inaccessible to the average student, I would makesure to implement a number of ways in which to allow students to feel in the know.First of all, I would hold office hours that were publicized including on social mediaso that students felt they could have easy access to give their opinions andunderstand everything going on. Moreover, I would publicize an anonymous googleform so that students could give their feedback in a comfortable manner for them.","As the university has lifted the mask mandate, it is important to still be monitoringthe COVID-19 infection rate and gauge students' comfortability with everythinggoing on. The university should still continue to encourage students to wear masksespecially after any sort of travel, attending a large gathering, or any other sort of
event that puts students at risk of infection with covid.","The university did not handle remote instruction and the pandemic as well as theycould have. While the pandemic in itself was met with much uncertainty and someof the university’s mishandlings were inevitable, there was definitely a lot of backand forth that led to confusion and frustration for the student body. Moreover,starting off the winter quarter online, then giving teachers a choice of how tocontinue instruction led to many inconsistencies with grading and learning, makingit more difficult for students to acclimate and form consistent routines."
Faith Johnson,holly,College of Letters and Sciences Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13122316/220408-FaithJohnson1-KaylaLi.jpg,,she/her,first-year,Environmental studies major,,,,"I am running to be a senator in the 73rd senate because I want to actually change and address the needs of the student body. As a first-year who struggled with finding mental health resources, I hope as a senator to make real changes. Many students face hardships while navigating through their college experience and it is crucial there are many resources that are accessible and affordable to the student body. This is something I hope I can change and make the UCSB community a better palace for student well-being. I was a part of my high school student council and was Senior Class President. I found a passion for leading and making change at my school and want to continue that at UCSB. I currently serve as one of the On-Campus Senators and have learned about how much a senator can do to positively impact the UCSB community and it has inspired me to continue with AS senate.","I currently serve as an on-campus senator which has prepared me to continue as a senator. I ran during the Winter quarter after a few senators resigned their position. I have learned important skills like communication, time management, and teamwork that I would continue to use as a part of the 73rd senate. Additionally, I am a part of the Santa Cruz Dorm hall council and sit on the executive hall council as the Media Coordinator. This has taught me how to listen to the needs of the residents of Santa Cruz dorm and make changes accordingly. I have also been in charge of holding programs that benefit the residents of Santa Cruz Dorm. One of these programs included Valentine's day event to make everyone feel loved and seen. I led a committee that cut out over 600 hearts and hand-wrote the names of every single resident, RA, ARD, and RD, and taped them on the wall of the conference room. This was a heartfelt approach to making everyone feel important and was shown immense support by the entire dorm. While I have only been a student here for one year I feel a part of the UCSB community and have a platform to represent my fellow students.","Three resolutions I would like to pass as a senator would be to
1. Increase funding for Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS). From my own personal experience as well as some of my peers have felt the extensive wait and insufficient access to CAPS are unacceptable. Students’ mental health should be a priority for the school. CAPS is a wonderful resource at UCSB that provides a plethora of resources to students, however, it can be challenging to receive because of the lack of staff.
2. Better awareness for UCSB Wellness. UCSB wellness is a great renounce on campus that many students are unaware of. As midterms, finals, and everyday life can be very overwhelming and stressful, UCSB wellness offers many
   
distressing opportunities that would benefit the student body if they were aware. I would allocate A.S resources to
make sure there was more awareness with more flyers, tabling, and access.
3. More access to Community Service Organization (CSO). CSO is another amazing resource at UCSB that students
could benefit from if needed. I want to make UCSB a safer community by making sure people are aware if they need help CSO would be able to offer and escort or help them in an unsafe situation.","As a senator, I plan to make UCSB a safer campus. In addition to physically making students feel safe at UCSB, I also want to make the atmosphere a more positive environment. College students' mental health is constantly overlooked and pushed under the rug. As a senator, I want to get rid of this and help the UCSB community have resources to help students’ well-being. I hope to work closely with mental health peer programs as well as better advertising for UCSB wellness, increase funding for Counseling & Psychological Services CAPS, and increase awareness and funding of the Community Service Organization (CSO). Many students are not aware of all of the resources UCSB wellness has to offer like their distressing events and many would benefit from these workshops and activities if they were aware. UCSB offers free counseling and psychological help to students through (CAPS) however it is extremely difficult to get an appointment in a timely manner. This is unacceptable because students’ mental health should not be something they have to wait for before they can get help. Additionally to make UCSB’s environment and atmosphere a more positive place I want to increase awareness about (CSO). It wasn’t until UCSB and Isla Vista became targeted by kidnappers that many people were aware of CSO escorts. It is also crucial that anyone in need of an escort can have one because no one should be in an unsafe situation without help.","I would work with Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS), UCSB wellness, the committee on student well-being, and Community Service Organization (CSO). I believe that mental health in college is extremely vulnerable and should be taken very seriously. The resources at UCSB right now are not sufficient and accessible to everyone in need.","I would have weekly office hours that are made very clear to my constituents that are always a place for people to voice their thoughts and opinions. In addition, I would be available to make an appointment in incase someone was not able to attend my office hours. In a remote capacity, I would hold all meetings on zoom and make sure my camera is on so my constituents know they have my full attention and I am engaged and want to hear what they have to say. In an in-person capacity, I would hold my office hours and appointments in person in the AS building. I would be accommodating to everyone and if requested to meet online with the uncertainty of COVID I would do so.","I already have experience with the senate as I am currently serving in the 72nd senate as an on-campus senator. I joined the Senate in the middle of the Winter quarter. In the uncertainty of the situation, I had to quickly learn the procedure and adapt to the novelty of the senate. This showcases my ability to learn quickly and be flexible. These two qualities would additionally help me in the 73rd senate. In addition to my current experience with the senate, I also served as the president of my high school student council which gave me the opportunity to learn about student government and needs. Finally, I am extremely outgoing and personable which gives me the ability to connect well with students. I am open-minded and willing to learn which is important when being a senator.",Left-leaning,"Very Good The 72nd senate has done a great job of listening to the needs of students. One instance, in particular, is the policy about hybrid instruction. They heard the needs of the students who were faced with the difficulties of this pandemic and met their needs accordingly."," No I would not vote in favor of divestment because this resolution does more harm than good. The resolution has a biased narrative that is rooted in antisemitism. This resolution does not instill peace but quite the opposite and is something I would not stand for. However, I am still learning and want to hear what my constituents have to say and listen to their viewpoints as I am still learning and want to hear what my constituents have to say. I am always committed to listening to others’ viewpoints.","No While in theory, tuition-free college would be ideal it is simply not applicable. Additionally, as an elected senator, this would not be in my jurisdiction and I would have no say over this.
","While mental health services at UCSB are growing, they are still not adequate. There are many resources at UCSB to help students; there are simply not enough. CAPS does not have enough staff to meet the needs of all the students who seek help. There is a waitlist that takes months to get off. Additionally, there is not enough awareness about this resource as well as UCSB wellness. UCSB wellness has many tools to offer to students but the issue is not enough students know about it. All incoming student, freshman and transfer students should be made aware of these resources from week one with flyers, speakers at large lectures, and tabling.","I believe that the university has not held these organizations accountable for their actions. Many fraternities have been able to go around the universities' policies by having satellite houses that are not held to the same standards. This has led to many unaccpable situations including sexual assaults as well as drugging and attempted offenses. This is unacceptable and should not
be tolerated. If a fraternity or sorority does not abide by the rules clearly stated by the university they should not be allowed on campus. Minimal punishment is given to those organizations that have allegations and this is unacceptable. Allowing fraternities and sororities to stay on campus after being convicted of such an allegation is unacceptable and insulting to those they may have harmed.","Yes, I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its functions. The university should provide easy access to mental health resources like Campus, Advocacy, Resources, and Education (CARE). This should be a known resource for sexual assault survivors and used its fullest capacity to reach as many survivors as possible because survivor's mental health is a priority.","I do not believe the university has done enough for minorities at UCSB. While the university has made strides in the right direction like student resource building, this is not enough for these underrepresented students. While I am not a part of the Black, Latinx, Indigenous, or LGBTQ+ community, I am eager to hear their views and listen to these communities to implement change where needed.",If elected to serve on the A.S. The first bill or resolution I would plan for the author would be to increase awareness for CAPS. This is because a student's mental health is extremely important and should not be taken lightly. It is important that everyone who is seeking help has an opportunity to get it. I would allocate A.S. resources so that everyone who was struggling knew about the options they have to receive help.,"If elected to be a senator I would make sure all freshman and transfer students are aware of A.S by heavily promoting this organization during welcome week. This could be done by social media posts, flyers at all housing, and fun events. In my experience, the most informational way to spread the news to incoming students is through the residence halls. This could be done by working with the chi-5’s hall councils and presenting to these groups. Hall council is overlooked however it is filled with engaged students who are eager to get involved. By utilizing this resource, A.S could be more well known and gain attention.","As a senator, I would make sure testing is widely accessible and reliable. Currently, students have the option to self-test themselves which can sometimes not be as accurate as trained professionals. I would make sure testing is more reliable by doing a nasal swab by a trained professional. In addition, I would continue the mask mandate in lectures to protect the majority of students while learning. Some lecture halls can exceed 600 students which would allow rapid spread of COVID if one student tested positive. By still requiring marks in a large lecture hall, this would be a safe way to continue in-person learning.
","Expressed by other students and myself I believe the university did a poor job of handling the pandemic. The reliance on green badges is an unreliable way to screen students. With the fear of not being able to attend class, eat at the dining hall, and go to the recreational center there which lead to falsified green badges with no repercussions. Additionally, the university failed in providing support to students who were not comfortable attending in-person classes. This issue was not resolved until brought to
the 72nd senate's attention and a new policy was created to allow hybrid instruction. As an immunocompromised student, it is very disheartening to see the university did not take action to protect compromised students. Not only was this impactful on the physical state of the student but also added to students' mental health. The fear of missing class and facing consequences to protect one’s health added unnecessary stress and anxiety to students' well-being."
Mina Matta,holly,College of Letters and Sciences Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13132320/MinaMatta.jpg,,she/her,second year,History of Public Policy and Law,,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 73rd senate because I am passionate about accurately representing the needs of students. I want to make A.S. more accessible and transparent to all Gauchos, so they feel welcome to share their concerns knowing that they will be addressed. As a student who experienced their entire first year virtually, I feel it is important to strengthen the connection between students, faculty, and administration. UCSB has many amazing resources and services to offer students and as a senator, I want to make sure that all of these are not only accessible but malleable to students’ needs, as they are constantly changing. In my time here at UCSB I have truly grown to love the campus, but know that there is always room for growth. I am committed to working with the Senate to ensuring an inclusive and transparent environment that students feel comfortable voicing their opinions and grievances in. I know that I have just one perspective, but I plan to communicate consistently with my constituents to create tangible change for students here at UCSB and help them gain access to the resources they need."," believe that my work as the Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for Alpha Chi Omega and as a Pearman Fellow for the Associated Students Living History Project has given me the knowledge and passion to advocate for the UCSB student body. Working with LHP allowed me to better understand the history of activism and student organizing at UCSB, which has only furthered my interest in making changes on campus. Learning about the wonderful ways in which students have impacted this campus was truly eye-opening and something that I would want to work to expand on, in the future. As the VP DEI of AXO, I work alongside other executive board members from the Panhellenic community to make social sororities more equitable and accessible. My position also includes representing people of many diverse backgrounds and experiences, which I believe has prepared me to be a senator. Through these leadership positions, I have been able to further develop my skills and understand the intricacies of running an organization full of people with differing opinions.","One of the main bills that I would like to introduce while in office is creating more student led mentorship programs within and between majors. As a student, I have noticed that it is difficult to get academic, social, or career advice and believe that the opportunity to discuss tips about classes, clubs or other opportunities with upperclassmen would be extremely beneficial. Especially with the implications of the adjustment in units during pass times, many students have been struggling to choose classes. Also, many second
year students are extremely unaware of all of the opportunities on campus, as they were online for their entire first year and did not receive a full in person introduction to campus. A resolution that I would like to introduce is reallocating more Associate Students Funds to the Black Womyn’s health collaborative and the Student Commission on Racial Equality. I think it is extremely important to highlight the mental health disparity in marginalized communities. Another bill that I plan on introducing is making sure that university funding is equitably allocated and transparent. I hope to facilitate an increase in funding to the cultural centers on campus and effectively inform the student body about all they have to offer. They have done very important work here and deserve to be recognized for their dedication to inclusivity and fostering safe environments for students at UCSB.","My platform as a senator is to make Associated Students more accessible and transparent for all students. In order to achieve my goals, I plan to collaborate with the rest of the senate and engage with students as much as possible to ensure that they feel their voices are heard and needs are met. I will do everything in my power to make myself available to students in person and virtually, through office hours and by responding to emails within 24 to 48 hours. I plan to work with several student organizations and A.S. entities to ensure that UCSB is a safe and inclusive environment. I will work specifically with the cultural centers in the Student Resource Building to make sure that they have the funding their need to continue and possibly help them to expand their organizations. I extremely
committed to equity and inclusivity and plan to do everything in my power as a senator to protect the mental and physical health of all UCSB students.","I hope to work with CAPS, Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), Public Safety Commission, and CARE to create more resources for the prevention and aftercare of sexual assault. I think that all of these organizations are great and with more funding and members, they could service the student body a great deal. I also plan to work with CSO and Commission on Student Wellbeing (COSWEB) to better the safety of students on and off-campus. I also hope to work with the Black Womyn’s health collaborative to address the mental health disparity in marginalized communities. I will also work with IVTU, food bank, legal resource center for basic needs to make sure that no UCSB student has to worry about food insecurity.","One of the most important parts of my platform is strengthening the communication between students, faculty, and administration. I want to ensure that all students feel that their grievances are not just heard but alleviated. As a student who experienced their entire first year at UCSB virtually, I understand there has been a huge disconnect between students and the school, and with the transition back to in-person learning it is crucial that we mend this gap. In order to make sure that students always feel comfortable voicing
their concerns, I will make sure that I have both in-person and zoom options for office hours and town halls. I will also respond to constituent emails within 24-48 hours and post senate meeting agendas on my social media each week so that people are aware of the issues being discussed. I also would like to create an anonymous platform for students in case they do not feel comfortable disclosing their names. I understand that Associate Students can be inaccessible sometimes and want to do everything that I can to change that.","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position as I am very hard working, open-minded, and motivated. Through VP Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion I have learned how to effectively advocate for underrepresented groups, which is definitely something that I will continue to do as a senator. I feel that through my experiences here at UCSB, I understand the needs of students and have become aware of all the different resources that are available. I am very passionate about improving the quality of the services that the university provides and I am dedicated to the wellbeings of all students.",Left-leaning,")Very good, I believe that the 72nd senate has had to endure many changes in the last year and they have done a great job handling the pandemic. I think that one of the biggest issues currently facing students is access to mental health services and lack of support for sexual assault survivors, which both have been advanced through the work of this senate and I intend on building upon this.","No, I do not feel entirely comfortable voicing my opinion on this topic, as I still have much to learn about the depth of it. As a senator, I am a representative of students here at
UCSB and without hearing the opinions of my constituents first, I cannot confidently vote on this and I want to be sure that I am able to represent them to the best of my abilities. With that being said, I am very eager to listen and learn more.","No, I believe in reducing the cost of tuition and definitely think that students from lower-income backgrounds should not have to bear the cost of tuition, however, there are currently many great resources on campus that are funded by these fees. I definitely think that free tuition is something that we can toward in the future, but for right now lowering the cost of higher education is a national conversation.","While I do think that CAPs is a great start to addressing the mental health of students, I definitely believe that it could be expanded. Mental health is an urgent issue that should always be prioritized. As a senator, I will work to make sure that CAPS gets the funding that it needs to ensure that therapists and counselors reflect the demographics of UCSB. I also think that is important to host more mental health town halls for different communities, especially in light of recent events. Through my work with the Living History Project, I have learned about many student demonstrations that lead to real, tangible change and I believe that the senate has the power to put pressure on the administration to expand the mental health services they have to offer.","As someone who is a part of a greek life, I think that the school definitely could have done a better job at handling these situations. As the Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, I work with other executive members from Panhellenic sororities to dismantle problematic traditions that could potentially be offensive or uncomfortable for people. I am a strong advocated for transparency and think we need more dialogue between administration and students. Fall quarter of 2021, I attended a Sexual Assault Town Hall with members of the administration and students and felt that the dialogue was long overdue and extremely necessary. A common concern that many students shared at the town hall was that many of the emails that are sent out to students detailing accounts of sexual assaults have been interpreted as victim blaming and ineffective when it came to actually addressing the situation. Unfortunately, not many people attended the event so the opinions were very limited. I personally feel as if many people would benefit from getting to voice their opinions directly to the administration and think that forums like this should definitely continue to happen, and they should be live streamed so that more students can participate and listen to the school’s responses to these extremely important questions.","Yes, and while I think that it is a good foundation for combatting sexual assault on campus, however I do believe that the university needs to be doing more to support survivors of sexual assault, especially in Isla Vista. The majority of students do not live in university-owned housing after their first or second year, and Title IX only applies to these buildings. The administration must do everything they can to protect and support all students, regardless of whether or not their experience was on or off-campus. Part of my platform is to make sure that more of the university and Associated Students is transparent and I believe that this applies to Title IX. Many students do not know about how it functions, or what to do if they are to ever have an experience with sexual assualt. As a senator, I will work to bring awareness to the Title IX process and make sure that resources such as CAPS, CARE, SASA continue to be available to students and get the funding they need to remain helpful to students. Unfortunately, sexual assault is a very prevelant issue on and off campus, and I beleiev that the school could be a lot more to ensure the safety of students.","As a woman of color and a first generation American, I believe that UCSB has done a great job in supporting historically underrepresented groups on campus. However, I do believe that there are more steps that the school can take in order to make sure that all students feel welcome everywhere on campus. Through my experience with the Associated Students Living History Project, I learned about the hunger strike that was organized by Chicanx students in 1994, in front of Cheadle Hall to draw attention the lack of resources and faculty in the department. Before becoming a part of the LHP, I had never heard of the strike, but after learning about it I was disheartened to find out that there is no marker of any kind to signify to students that a very important demonstration took place on our campus. As a senator, I plan to work with the cultural centers on campus to decolonize spaces on campus and make sure that every students feels seen and understood. I believe that university funding needs to be equitably allocated so that these incredible groups already doing such important work are able to expand their programming. I plan to advertise them more and ensure that people are aware of all the amazing things they have accomplished for our campus.
","As a senator, the first bill I plan to author is to ensure that the university has equitably allocated funds to all of the cultural groups on campus, so that they are able to continue to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment for historically underrepresented communities. I hope that if given the opportunity and the funding, El Centro (Chicanx/Latinx Cultural Resource Center) will be able to place a marker in front of
Cheadle hall commemorating the Hunger strike in 1994 that shed light on the lack of attention and funding of the Chicano Studies department. As someone from a Latinx background who has taken many classes from this department, I think that many students would appreciate a commemoration to the history of the department and the incredible students who fought so hard to make it the success it is today.","I would utilize social media as a tool to keep students informed about the work that the Senate is doing, as I believe that it is a great tool that many students would easily be able to stay updated on. I would also host office hours both virtually and in person, to make sure that students are able to discuss any questions or concerns that they may have. As a senator, my goal is to accurately represent the students of UCSB and ensure that they feel safe voicing their concerns. I will create a legislation tracker on the Associated Students website so that students are able to keep up with agendas, legislation and minutes from all senate meetings. I plan to host several town halls where students can bring forth their grievances in person or virtually and discuss them with me and fellow senators. I also plan to respond to emails from students within 24 to 48 hours.","I believe the Senate and university at large will play a very important role in making sure that students feel safe coming back to the classroom, especially since the mask mandate has been lifted. I personally believe that the university did a relatively good job in creating resources during the pandemic. Contact tracing and testing availability, in particular, were very successful and definitely should remain intact. I will work alongisde the rest of the senate to make sure that the school is able to continue and possibly expand funding for the AS Food Bank and the Basic Needs Taskforce, to make sure that no student has to worry about experiencing food insecurity. I also think that we should continue to encourage students to get tested if they are experiencing symptoms of any kind. If there were to be another spike in COVID cases, it is critical that the school clearly communicates to students the current and updated guidelines and has enough isolation housing to accommodate students who contract the virus. Although it is very difficult for professors, it is important that there is a hybrid option for people who cannot make it to class due to COVID and are not penalized for missing class.","I think that the pandemic has been very difficult for many people, myself included. One thing that I would definitely want to improve in my time as a senator is transparency. I believe that as students, we deserve to be informed about what is going on, especially
considering how much has changed in the last year. Remote instruction was definitely challenging for many students and now that we are back to in-person learning I think it is crucial that we re-establish the connection between faculty, administration and students. Many people lived at home for most of last year and did not have the same opportunities as others to get to know the campus and all that it has to offer. As a student who experienced their first year at UCSB virtually, I feel that the school could have done a better job at tending to the mental health of students during the pandemic, but I understand that we were living through unprecedented times and that they did what they could, but moving forward I plan to advocate for students who’s mental and physicall health was affected by the pandemic and make sure that they have access to the resources that they need. On the other hand, I do believe that UCSB was very successful in their testing capacity, as it was always easy to make an appointment for a free test at many places on campus. Considering the uncertainty of the situation, I believe that the university did very well in their handling of the pandemic."
Tessa Veksler,holly,College of Letters and Sciences Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13132240/220407-TessaVeksler-EmmettRuhland.jpg,,she/her,second year,Political Science and Communications Double Major,,,,"I have always been passionate about political advocacy, but when I came to college I
realized that my drive for social change was amplified by those around me. More so, I realized
that as a college student, what I became passionate about changed, or rather, became more
specific to my campus. Rather than being passionate about mental health awareness, I became
interested in what that meant at UCSB, such as what mental health resources were available and
how they were available to all students.
I am running to be a senator in the 73rd Senate because I care about being a part of the
change that needs to be done in order to make UCSB a better academic and social environment
for all students. Although I have been in several leadership positions, being in Senate is unique.
It is a leadership role that forces you to think outside of yourself and your position, and rather
focus on what you can do to represent and advocate for your constituents. I am excited to be a
senator, but most of all, I am looking forward to the opportunity it gives me to get to know my
peers and better understand the diverse campus life at UCSB.","This past year I have worked in the Associated Students Office of the President as one ofthe Co-Commissioners of Mental Health. During my time in this position, I have organized andmoderated UCSB’s annual Mental Health Town Hall. This experience allowed me to becomemore informed on all of the mental health resources offered on campus, which thereforepresented me with the knowledge I could use to better serve the student population. Furthermore,in this role, I became more familiar with the inner workings of Associated Students, especiallySenate for which I have proxied many times, and has given me the opportunity to hear fromstudents directly about their concerns surrounding the way our university handles mental health
 and other issues. In addition, proxying for Senate and maintaining working relationships with
 current senators has provided me with a thorough understanding of bureaucratic procedures and
 legal code.Furthermore, I have been active on campus with regard to political advocacy and currentevents. For instance, as a Ukrainian student and a member of Associated Students, I foundmyself immensely involved in supporting UCSB’s Slavic students through the ongoing crisis inUkraine. I tabled for hours with an “I Stand With Ukraine” campaign and started a SlavicStudent Group in order for students to connect with one another. In addition, I am currentlyworking on a positional resolution with senators in support of Gauchos affected by this crisis.","With my experience working as the commissioner of mental health in the AssociatedStudents Office of the President, I have developed a passion for mental health advocacy. Moreimportantly, being in this position has given me the opportunity to hear from students and themental health professionals at UCSB. Notably, our school has fallen short in many regards whentackling the accessibility of mental health resources on campus, especially during the pandemic.Therefore, one of the first resolutions I would like to introduce while in office would be onedirecting UCSB’s Public & Mental Health Commission (PMHC), the Mental Health Task Force,and the collective mental health organizations on campus (i.e. CAPS, Health & Wellness, etc.) toupdate their websites and overall accessibility to students.As a senator, I also will continue to stress the importance of reacting promptly andvigilantly to current events crises. Whether it be the crisis in Ukraine currently or the horrific risein anti-Asian hate over the course of the pandemic, it is our duty as a progressive university tosupport our students and be proactive in aiding those affected by ongoing crises. In addition,campus crises that arise, such as damage to bike paths that prevent students from safelytransporting to class, need financial backing. In order to encompass these issues, I would like tointroduce a directional resolution setting aside money into a crisis response fund.The UCSB and Isla Vista community has recently faced extremely alarming notificationssurrounding sexual assault. I will continue to state this, but it is absolutely essential that thisSenate and this university does better with regard to addressing cases of sexual assault andsupporting survivors of sexual assault. In Associated Students, it is our duty to not only be avoice for the student body but to be an exemplary entity at UCSB. As a senator, along with mycontinued support for victims on an individual level, I would like to introduce a positionalresolution that addresses the Senate’s commitment to transparency surrounding cases of sexualassault within Associated Students and beyond.","As a senator, I want to create a dialogue between the student body and studentgovernment. In Associated Students, our purpose is to act swiftly and passionately in accordancewith students’ needs. Whether this means advocating for greater accessibility to mental healthresources on campus or responding to ongoing current events crises, my goal is to uplift andempower students’ voices while creating actionable change. In order to accomplish this, I willmake myself an available resource, both in-person and remotely, to all students wanting to raisetheir campus concerns. This will include active social media posts about campus resources,weekly office hours, and active reports about the ongoing issues on the Senate floor. As I haveoutlined in my three resolutions, I work with other A.S. entities and CROs to make bothdirectional and positional resolutions. I also intend to make Associated Students more accessibleto the average student. As a senator, I am here to amplify the voices of the student body as acampus leader, but I am also here to be your colleague, resource, and friend.","In order to support survivors of sexual assault, I would work with SASA to achieve thisand to create a unified effort in creating transparency surrounding sexual assault withinAssociated Students. With regard to acting swiftly in current events and crises, I would workwith the Financial Crisis Response Team and Basic Needs Committee. COSWB, CAPS, Healthand Wellness, CARE, and the ASOP Co-Commissioners next year would be my go-toorganizations when discussing the changes that need to be made regarding access to mentalhealth resources on campus.","As a senator, I will make myself available to my constituents through weekly office hourswhich will be available with both in-person and remote options. This will most likely be donethrough an appointment system in which students can indicate their preferred mode of meeting.Beyond office hours, I would make myself an accessible resource to students and various campusorganizations by being available to contact via email, social media, or phone when applicable.
 I’d like to stress that I am determined to be a resource to my constituents in whatever capacity
 ","Through my experience working in the Associated Students Office of the President, Ibelieve I have gained a unique perspective on advocacy and administration. In addition, as Ifrequently proxied for Senate and attended Senate meetings, I have gained a valuable insight intohow the Senate functions. I also spent my first year at UCSB studying abroad, which expandedmy worldview and equipped me with the ability to adapt to new situations, manage my time, andmultitask in various roles. I am open-minded, sociable, passionate, and immensely driven tolisten and implement changes for the betterment of our student body. As I will always say, beinga senator to me means listening to and amplifying the multitude of diverse voices on this campuswhile creating actionable change.", Left-leaning,"GoodOverall, I would assess the work of the 72nd A.S. Senate in addressing the needs of the student
body as good. However, I believe that this Senate has lacked unity, which has therefore affected
their ability to take stances on significant issues as a united front. Furthermore, this Senate has
been prompt in addressing current events within the UCSB community and on a global scale.
Most importantly, I would like to emphasize that there were several exceptional senators this
year that demonstrated that they strive to maintain bureaucratic procedure and respect toward
their constituents.","No I would vote against this resolution because it is ineffective in promoting peace in the Middle
East. Furthermore, it is statistically proven that when BDS resolutions pass on college campuses,
rates of antisemitism rise. As a Senate, it is our responsibility to mitigate conversations of peace,
progression, and coexistence.","No  In theory, I believe that public education should be tuition-free. However, this issue is
 completely outside of my scope and jurisdiction as a UCSB senator.","Being a co-commissioner of mental health has opened my eyes to the variety of theresources on campus but also to the major shortcomings of these resources. During the annualMental Health Town Hall that I moderated this school year, most students raised their concernsabout the accessibility of the mental health resources on campus. The mental health services atUCSB are inadequate in their ability to accommodate all of the students that need them and inthe way that they make themselves accessible, either by simplifying their websites or by makingthemselves known to all students on campus. In order to address this problem, there needs to be agreater allocation of funding to these resources and significant updates done to their websites andoutreach in order to increase overall accessibility to students. As a senator, I would work withUCSB’s Public & Mental Health Commission (PMHC), the Mental Health Task Force, thecollective mental health organizations on campus (i.e. CAPS, Health & Wellness, etc.), and themental health commissioners in ASOP to accomplish these goals.","No, I do not believe the university has handled these allegations appropriately ordisplayed enough conviction against these acts. Although I am not a member of Greek life atUCSB, many of my constituents are. With approximately one-tenth of the school populationbeing involved in Greek life, it is crucial that the school holds these organizations accountablewhen allegations of this nature arise. Every student deserves to feel safe and supported by theiruniversity, which includes prevention of issues such as hazing with training and awareness, aswell as serious ramifications for school-affiliated organizations which breach these protocols.","Yes, I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its functions. However, I am
also aware that this organization does not do nearly enough to support survivors of sexual assault
at our university. The school often acts retroactively rather than proactively with regard to cases
of sexual assault. I believe the university needs to take a more proactive stance and advocate for
survivors while implementing harsher ramifications for Greek organizations with these
allegations. The university also needs to make resources like CARE more accessible to students.","No, I do not believe that UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresentedgroups. Although UCSB has programs available to these groups, diversity needs to be reflectedon all levels, including in administration and in offered courses. Furthermore, accessibility needsto be improved in order to address the significant disparities at UCSB, such as minority groupsbeing disproportionately affected by the pandemic. As someone who does not identify with anyof these groups, I know that it is essential that I mainly act as a listener and a facilitator ofconversation between these groups and the university. As a senator, I will reach out to variousCROs’ leadership and other organizations that represent these underrepresented groups in orderto discuss with them and work with them to bring about concrete change.","If I am elected to serve on the A.S. Senate the first resolution I plan to author is theresolution I outlined in my previous response that sets aside money to form a crisis responsefund. The reason I would author this resolution first is that funds like this are typically allocatedtowards the beginning of the school year.As a senator, I also will continue to stress the importance of reacting promptly andvigilantly to current events crises. Whether it be the crisis in Ukraine currently or thehorrific rise in anti-Asian hate over the course of the pandemic, it is our duty as aprogressive university to support our students and be proactive in aiding those affected byongoing crises. In addition, campus crises that arise, such as damage to bike paths thatprevent students from safely transporting to class, need financial backing. In order toencompass these issues, I would like to introduce a directional resolution setting asidemoney into a crisis response fund.","I would first like to state that I absolutely agree with the statement that AssociatedStudents is often inaccessible to the average student. This is an ironic failure, in my opinion, ofour goal as the student government on campus as we aim to represent the student body. As asenator, I would work to make Associated Students a well-known resource on campus, whetherthis means more social media outreach or personal connections with students and other campusorganizations. Furthermore, I would encourage the Senate to release reports of weekly meetingswhich outline passed legislation. I would also encourage students to utilize the public forumduring Senate meetings if they are interested in sharing information or speaking on legislationthat they are passionate about. I also believe that Associated Students should table morefrequently, especially during Welcome Week, so that new students are aware of studentgovernment and can choose to participate or utilize it as a resource in the future.","I believe it is the university’s top responsibility to ensure that students’ physical andmental health is protected. The university should continue to respond to the ongoing pandemicaccording to CDC and other community health guidelines. In addition, although mask mandatesare being lifted, professors and other university faculty should encourage students to take care oftheir health while taking necessary precautions. I believe the university and the Senate shouldcontinue to encourage students to wear masks when applicable and participate in rounds ofCOVID testing. However, it will ultimately be up to the individual student’s discretion whetheror not they wear a mask when mandates are lifted.I would like to add that as members of Associated Students, our two primaryresponsibilities in this regard are to set a good example by following the guidelines set in placeby the university or community and to listen to students’ needs and concerns in order to representour student body accurately. If elected, I promise to listen to my constituents’ concerns and actupon them to the best of my ability and within my jurisdiction.","During my first year at UCSB, I was studying abroad while completing my coursework
 for UCSB remotely. In my personal experience, having classes in zoom format made it possible
for me to study in a different country while still completing my units at UCSB. However, I know
that my anecdotal experience is not a reflection of the student body’s experience during remote
learning. I believe that the university succeeded in handling remote instruction as well as the
slow transition into hybrid and in-person learning. On the other hand, the university failed in
many ways to accommodate the needs of students who suffered during the pandemic either
because of mental health or because Zoom instruction was not the best way for students to do
well in their classes.
One issue that many students faced was quarantine housing and accessibility to testing.
Especially at the height of COVID-19 cases, UCSB struggled to accommodate all the students in
need of tests. Furthermore, students living in Isla Vista had to figure out their own quarantine
accommodations and quarantine housing was not necessarily an option available to them. With
regards to mental health, it is understandable that resources such as CAPS were overwhelmed
with students needing aid during the pandemic. Although I can sympathize with the lack of funds
or available resources, I believe the university failed to provide students with the opportunity to
get help when their mental heal"
Adam Majcher ,asumi,Off-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13131937/220408-AdamMajcher-EmmettRuhland.jpg,,he/him,third year,Political Science & History Double Major ,,,,"I am running to be a Senator with the 73rd Senate because I believe I have a combination of knowledge, experience, and passion to understand and actually fix the problems present at UCSB and within Associated Students. Through being enrolled at UCSB for three years and being a part of Associated Students for nearly the same amount of time, I am very familiar with the problems facing the university, Isla Vista, and Associated Students at the moment. Whether it be well-known issues like safety or housing, or lesser known ones like the current unsustainability of the A.S. budget or inaccessibility of shoreline and difficulty for students to get involved in the various resources and organizations UCSB offers, I am familiar with them and current efforts to remedy them or lack thereof. I am also very familiar with Associated Students processes and understand the power the association has, but also its limitations, meaning I have the knowledge and ability to create tangible change where it is actually possible. I am devoted to helping students and their groups have the absolute best experience they can possibly have despite the seemingly endless challenges the students themselves face under the current administration and increasingly tumultuous world environment. I believe that with my experience in Associated Students, I can serve as an effective and highly motivated Senator with a better platform to utilize my knowledge and experience than before to better student lives and remedy many problems plaguing the university and Isla Vista.","I have been involved with many organizations within Associated Students. Last year I worked in the Office of the Internal Vice President, Committee on Committees, Isla Vista Arts, and the Finance and Business Committee, where I served as a financial officer. This year I am the chief financial officer within the F&B committee as well as the co-chair of the Safe Transportation Task Force instituted by the ASOP. All of these experiences have allowed me to really understand Associated Students from many different angles to have a full understanding of its abilities and limitations. Due to my two year experience in the Finance and Business Committee, I am one of the most qualified to help fix the problems in Associated Students’ budget that the pandemic has caused, as many of the BCUs in Associated Students that receive funding have not been able to hold events that they normally would have in person, as well as create a formal yet accessible guide to Associated Students money which has proven to be incredibly difficult to understand due to how complicated the system of funding is and has caused substantial problems for students and staff alike. Furthermore, I am a part of Phi Alpha Delta and was elected to serve as the organization's Professional Fraternity Council representative, and am a part of both KCSB as a DJ and the Daily Nexus as a writer. I also served as a Flock Mentor, mentoring a group of 16 second year students when they were new to an in-person UCSB. Through these experiences, I have plenty of Associated Students experience to serve effectively as a potential Senator, but am also familiar with organizations outside of Associated Students whose members I would be representing and helping, which the positions listed above have allowed me to do prior as well.","Three resolutions or bills I would like to introduce are a bill to provide financial transparency and increase the consistency of how funding is given out and budgets are allocated, a bill that clarifies the legal code behind the Finance and Business Committee, detailing more clear duties for the F&B chair and clarifying certain aspects of the standing committee, and finally a directional resolution that encourages the UCSB administration to devote more resources to mental health and especially hiring mental health professionals. The legislation about financial transparency would be paired with a written document that I write that thoroughly lays out the most important aspects of A.S. finance and how it works in an incredibly readable way that students can access if they are confused about any part of the process, whether it be requisitions to budgets to where the money comes from. The legislation about clarifying aspects about the Finance and Business Committee in legal code would also include a change to increase the amount of time Senators and financial officers attend budget hearings in order to provide a more thorough process, as well as defining the role of the F&B chair and Chief Financial Officer a bit better and more clearly. Finally, the directional resolution regarding hiring more mental health professionals would be targeted at UCSB and specifically the program of CAPS, which consistently has extremely long wait times for students who are struggling with mental health problems so that they can see a professional much closer to when they need it.","My platform consists of financial reforms within Associated Students and the Finance and Business Committee, helping create a safer campus through creative student-led initiatives and increasing resources devoted to campus safety, and helping students become involved in all of the various opportunities at UCSB by increasing advertising and resources provided to club rush events and revamping club websites. I plan to achieve financial reform by working directly with the Finance and Business Committee in order to create a more transparent budget and funding process, especially during budget hearings, creating a thorough but easily accessible and readable guide on associated students funding, which has consistently proven to be incredibly complex and confusing, and by creating a series of historical data for expenses and events held by clubs and organizations to pass on from year so that each organization starts the year with a better foundation of what their organization does and has historically done and spent money on. I plan on continuing creative, student-led efforts for campus safety like the Safe Transportation Task Force, and working with the President and EVLPA and their offices in order to help create more creative solutions given the incredibly prominent increase in sexual assault and harassment cases during the school year, as well as increase funding for various resources for survivors. Finally, I will work with those experienced in technology and website building to help make Shoreline easier to navigate for students interested in getting involved in campus activities. I will also help organize and advertise, as well as increase the resources given to club rush events so that students have more opportunities and are more likely to hear about them in order to get involved in campus life.","I would like to work with the Finance and Business Committee and its advisors to accomplish my goals of financial and budget reforms and mass clarification of financial policies, especially given by strong relationships I have already built and maintained within the standing committee over the past 2 years. I would like to work with the Office of the President to create further creative initiatives to combat the student safety issues on and around campus, similar in nature to the Safe Transportation Task Force established by the current AS President, as well as with organizations like Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) and Commission on Student Well-Being (COSWB). For my platform about expanding club and organization accessibility to the student body, I would primarily work with individuals who are well versed in technology or website design in order to make shoreline easier to navigate. I would also work with executive offices and other student representatives to increase awareness and resources provided for various club rush events.","Given that accessibility and availability are heavily tied together, and accessibility to Associated Students has been a major problem throughout its entire history, I would aim to make myself as accessible as possible for anyone, whether they prefer in-person or remote meetings. As such, I would hold hybrid office hours and would try to meet students outside of those office hours if they are unable to make them and I am available at the time they propose. I would publicize this on my social media in order to spread the message, and encourage all Senators’ office hours to be made widely and easily available in a plethora of places from websites to social media pages.","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I have concrete and specific ideas that can be reasonably implemented as a Senator, I have plentiful experience both in Associated Students and in other opportunities and organizations at UCSB, and because I have a deep passion for helping the student body, which can be seen through my many years already in Associated Students.",Left-leaning,"Good; Due to the uncertain nature of the current school year, it would be difficult for any group of Senators to fully and exceptionally serve all of the vast needs of the student body at the moment. Nonetheless, from speaking with many of the current Senators, the passion they hold for genuinely helping the student body and many of the actions they have taken have effectively remedied or attempted to remedy many of the most common issues students have faced, especially regarding the altering online/in person school year we have faced.","No; The topic of divestment is incredibly complex, complicated, and divisive, especially on college campuses. While I would personally be against this type of resolution based on my knowledge of the situation and duty to serve the interests of UCSB students first and foremost, I condemn recent laws targeting Palestinian spouses and fully encourage providing humanitarian aid to those in need in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip. ","No;  I believe that higher education should be universally accessible, however, I do not believe that a tuition-free UCSB is realistically feasible nor remotely likely or within my power during my potential term next year. Rather, I believe that the focus should be on providing more financial aid for students that need it, providing far more opportunities for scholarships, and encouraging assistance and forgiveness for student loans as things that I would fight for within my power as a Senator and challenge UCSB to do. ","No. From my personal experience as well as the experience of nearly every single other student I know who has experienced mental health services here, the mental health services at UCSB are simply inadequate. Students are forced to wait for sometimes even months at a time for an appointment at CAPS, or seek help outside of UCSB, an option which is either not covered by UCSHIP or only partially covered depending on various circumstances. While other options are available, albeit often for more specific situations, they are not well advertised by UCSB and are found by students from other students or student organizations rather than the university itself. In order to address the problem, UCSB needs to put far more effort and resources into mental health initiatives. Many are available in theory, but nearly all of them lack the necessary funding or advertising to truly be effective. While students are doing their best to promote their own and each other’s mental health, given the recent pandemic and its massive mental health effects, it is egregious how little effort UCSB has put in comparatively to increase mental health facilities. While there are many amazing student-led mental health resources and events, like the PMHC, and Office of the President’s Mental Health Town Halls, there is a severe lack of easily and quickly available mental health professionals at UCSB, a problem the administration must take seriously since this is a role students simply cannot fill themselves.","Sexual assault has perhaps been at its most rampant state ever in the past school year given the massive amount of cases that have occurred and continual mental health damage it has caused the student body on a daily basis, both due to the trauma endured by survivors and constant fear so many face walking on or near campus. Because of this, it is more important than ever to address it both proactively and reactively, preventing it from happening in the future and taking action against organizations and people which have continued its proliferation. UCSB has continually failed to support the student body on issues related to sexual assault, whether it be a consistent lack of “timely” warnings or delivering inconsistent, inadequate responses to organizations, including greek organizations, affiliated with the campus that have had sexual assault occur at their events or by their members. Sexual assault cannot be tolerated in any capacity, and any organizations that have consistently proven to facilitate an environment in which it is prevalent should be held strictly accountable and be at risk of losing their right to be a part of UCSB and its surrounding community. Hazing should not be tolerated in any capacity either, and any organization that participates in this practice should be held similarly strictly accountable and be at risk of losing its ability to exist at or near UCSB. While social distancing guidelines are no longer in effect, organizations that participate in hazing or have broken social distancing policy when it was in effect show a willful, institutional, and organized multi-member decision making process that ignores university and common public guidelines explicitly made to protect students and communities. As such, these cases, and especially hazing, show an institutional problem in relevant organizations that must be strictly addressed by the university.","Yes, I am familiar with the Title IX office and its functions, however, I believe that the university can do much more to support survivors of sexual assault beyond the scope of Title IX. Firstly, increasing the amount of exposure and resources dedicated to organizations that help survivors is crucial, and as a Senator I would help BCUs like SASA that directly work with survivors with both of these things. Furthermore, I think it is important to listen to survivors when they speak about their experiences, however, survivors should not feel pressured or obligated to tell their stories. Too many survivors have been ignored or brushed to the side, and beyond simply providing resources, we as a campus must learn to listen and create an environment where more survivors feel welcome and safe to speak out and actually believe that there will be repercussions against those that wronged them without being dismissed. I plan to work with the EVPLA and ASOP in order to create more proactive student-led safe and accessible community solutions, such as the Safe Transportation Task Force, as well as expand existing programs that have worked in order to further increase campus safety. I am also an advocate for stricter punishments against those that commit sexual assault and any institutions or organizations that seem to perpetually create an environment where sexual assault cases occur.","UCSB needs to put in significantly more work in order to effectively serve historically underrepresented groups. While I am not a member of the Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and many other historically underrepresented communities, I am dedicated to listening to members of these communities’ experiences on or around campus and help create change through my position with their input and suggestions. From my three years at UCSB, what I have learned is that overwhelmingly students from these communities that I have interacted with do not feel like UCSB is effectively serving their needs, and that they often feel isolated in a school in which white students seem to dominate campus life. Even when there are resources available for certain underrepresented groups, like RCSGD for the LGBTQ+ community, there are definitely places at or affiliated with UCSB where there exists an unwelcoming or even hostile environment to individuals who identify with certain groups that the university has systematically failed to attempt to remedy. Both university-led as well as student-led organizations must reflect and act in order to make themselves more friendly and welcoming to historically underrepresented groups, and challenge themselves to incorporate more ideas of diversity, equity, and inclusion into their institution.","The first bill I plan to order is one that begins creating historical data for both expenditures and events held by each Associated Students organization that has a budget. This would require each organization to keep track of what they spend money on as well as what events they hold and then pass this information on to future members of that organization. This is vital because of how much the budget has been disrupted by the pandemic, and how even now as we are back in person it has affected Associated Students and the events organizations are doing. Due to the nature of university, students come and go in a matter of a few years, and organizations often switch the majority of their members from year to year. Due to the pandemic there were often no ways for new students in Associated Students to know what their organizations do or have done in the past, before remote instruction. By providing historical data, it allows students to continue the important work that many organizations have done and provide a much better idea of what their money is supposed to be going toward and what events to hold. This does not mean that the same events or expenditures must be made, as creative and innovative new events are always welcome, but it does mean organizations each year have a better foundation to figure out and plan their budget and events. Furthermore, the distribution of the budget has been confusing and at times a bit controversial in past years due to the pandemic and decreases in the budget but current inflation and increase in the amount of honoraria individuals earn, as well as an increase in the sheer number of organizations requesting a budget. Because of this, providing historical data to budget hearings for Finance and Business committee from the past years of what an organization has spent money on and events it has held will greatly help provide transparency and information for how and why to distribute the budget and how and why it was distributed to the student body. Finally, despite the slight increase in bureaucracy this would cause, it would help increase accountability and transparency by strongly encouraging organizations with a budget to use that budget effectively and use their positions of power to help the student body.","Firstly, while the website for Senate is really well done, I would suggest moving the link to view all Senators closer to the top so that students can more easily find their elected representatives. I would also try to have a page on the Senate website that lists and details all legislation that has passed in order to increase transparency and allow students to access what their representatives have worked on. Furthermore, I would work with the Office of the Internal Vice President to continue to post any legislation that passes on social media, which is a project started two years ago while I served in the office that proved to be quite helpful. In terms of how to involve the student body, posting updates on social media and advertising various updates on legislation passed by the Senate that is especially relevant to the student body would be a good step in creating more engagement between the student body and Associated Students. Programs like the Pearman Fellowship are excellent ways for students to get involved in Associated Students, and many of the most important events in the Association are passed by word of mouth. For any incredibly pressing issues that affect the student body, such as changes in the P/NP deadlines, can be sent out on a mass scale through email.","I believe that UCSB should continue in-person instruction, with recorded lectures and guaranteed ways to make up missed days due to illness. Professors must provide the latter in order to not force students to come to class when they are feeling ill at risk of their grade being punished. This will help combat many potential COVID-19 outbreaks and increase student health at large by encouraging students to stay home and stop being contagious before returning to in-person instruction. Students need to be guaranteed a high-quality, in-person education, especially given tuition remains the same whether we are online or in person. Furthermore, with the substantially decreased number of cases and incredibly high vaccination rates at the university, students are much less likely to contract COVID-19 at UCSB and surrounding areas than they were over the past several months. With the extreme mental health effects that online instruction and lockdowns cause and countless other side effects, it is vital to keep our learning in-person. Senate should urge the administration to continue in-person instruction but ask for better and guaranteed accommodations be made for any students feeling ill. Currently, the solution or lack thereof for a student being ill varies greatly from professor to professor, but guaranteed grade make-up and recorded lectures should be required for all classes to combat this problem. In regards to the mask mandate, students should be encouraged but not required to wear masks. Due to current COVID-19 cases being at one of the lowest points they have ever been during the course of the pandemic and vaccination at UCSB being so high, if the above steps are taken and students don’t feel they are forced to go to class even if they are sick, there is minimal risk in lifting the mask mandate.","I think the university continued its abhorrent mental health track record by continuing to fail in providing adequate mental health resources, especially in the form of easily and quickly accessible mental health professionals, in a period of time that was perhaps the worst mass mental health pit in recent history. While the university kept pointing students to CAPS during the pandemic, wait lines soared to months, and many students only received an appointment they scheduled during the pandemic after we returned to in-person instruction or over the summer. While the university succeeded in mandating vaccinations and temporarily mandating mask wearing during the height of the pandemic, it failed in many, many other ways. While there were state and local mandates for lockdown, which is out of the administration’s control, there was far more it could have done to assist student’s mental and physical health during this time, especially given tuition remained the same despite the much lower costs and quality of online instruction. Given this massive excess of money the university had, more mental health professionals could have been hired to combat the mass mental health struggles students faced during the pandemic, or outdoor gym equipment and more efficient testing practices and resources, like free testing kits, could have been supplied to assist student’s physical health. Furthermore, forcing professors to make a decision between in-person or remote instruction during Winter Quarter provided unnecessary strain and stress for students and faculty alike, and perfectly showcases the nature of the administration to favor its reputation through signaling rather than tangibly increasing the mental and physical health of students. This is similarly showcased in the university’s constant pointing to CAPS during the pandemic as if it was advocating for mental health help when it has systematically underfunded and understaffed mental health resources for years when compared to what students need."
Alexa Grines,asumi,Off-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13114936/220407-AlexaGrines-EmmettRuhland.jpg,,she/her,third year,Political Science major,,,,"I decided to run to be a senator with the 73rd senate because like most people who do, I feel the responsibility to give back to the community which has given me so much. In my short time at UCSB I have absolutely fallen in love with the community and individuals here, but I have also been faced with numerous items that can be improved among the university. It is so important to me that our campus makes their resources accessible and equitable for all students. I have what it takes to be the bridge between the student body and UCSB faculty/staff in ensuring that the voices in the school population are heard. My goal for UCSB is to make it a better place than what it was when I arrived. I believe that being a part of senate is the perfect place to come together with students who have a similar passion for UCSB and collaborate to truly make UCSB the best place it could be.","Although I have been at this institution for less than an academic year, I feel as though I have had many opportunities to become involved with many organizations on campus. Currently, I am an involved member at Chabad, Hillel and SSI. I am also a member of Tau Sigma, an honors society for transfer students. I have gotten to see various organizations, groups and clubs and am interested in hopefully taking a leadership role this coming school year. Having been involved in various groups this year has allowed me to get to know the student body and their needs, better preparing me to be a representative leader for them.","If elected to serve on the A.S. Senate, I plan to introduce a bill that involves Title IX and sexual assault. I hope to create a quarterly, in-person townhall to discuss the matters of sexual assault. These matters include the process by which survivors can access Title IX and other resources offered to them. A resolution I would like to introduce is increasing trained staff with CAPS so that students are able to walk in and have brief assessments instead of having to make an appointment months in advance. It is discouraging for students when they are turned away from the places they are told would help them, and these students often do not end up receiving the help they are seeking. By increasing staff and appointment availability, the issues surrounding CAPS would be resolved. Another thing I would like to introduce while in office is placing compost bins in each of the university’s dining halls. The amount of food that goes to waste is disheartening and by adding compost, UCSB could be one step closer to becoming a green campus.","My platform involves a few main points: increasing accessibility to mental health resources on campus, increase actions taken by UCSB to educate student about sexual violence, harassment and crimes, as well as increasing environmental sustainability around the campus and Isla Vista. In order to achieve the goal of increasing accessibility to mental health resources on campus, I will urge CAPS to update their appointment making system as well as provide alternative mental health resources to students who feel as though CAPS has not served them. Next, I would like to implement a quarterly townhall to discuss the sensitive yet important topic of sexual violence, harrassment and crimes that have plagued Isla Vista in the past few months. These townhalls will consist of transparency of incidents and how they were taken care of, resources to reach out to, and prevention education. Lastly, environmental sustainability is something that I am extremely passionate about. Having worked at one of the university’s dining halls the past three quarters, I have come to realize how much food waste there is. I would like to implement a composting system at university dining halls and around the Isla Vista community. It is super important that our campus reduces their carbon footprint.","I hope to work with CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), CARE (Campus Advocacy Resource and Education Center), and SASA (Students Against Sexual Assault) in order to achieve some of the bigger points in my platform. Another resource I hope to work with is UCSB’s A.S. Public and Mental Health Commission. Since becoming involved in A.S., I have grown to learn about various mental health resources on campus. That being said, I hope to promote these resources so that individuals who are not as involved on campus have a sense of what sort of resources are provided to them. Along with those resources listed, I would also like to work with DSP in ensuring that every student gets the assistance that they deserve. Being a transfer student, I have found a lot of comfort in the Transfer Student Center and would like to also work with the TSC in planning events and promoting its services on campus. I would be more than happy to work with other organizations or entities that are not specified in my platform to learn more about the community as well as provide a sense of support amongst our diverse student body.","I have a plan to make myself available in a few different ways. I plan on having an office-hours with an optional remote zoom link. These office hours will be dedicated to students who have questions, concerns, suggestions or even just want to hang out! Along with that, I plan on creating a social media account specifically geared towards the student body. It can sometimes be more helpful for students to reach out over social media rather than in a professional setting.","I have been told I have a leader personality type. In any community I am placed in, I feel compelled to take up a leadership position. I have been through countless leadership trainings, held various leadership roles, have great interpersonal skills, time management skills and work well under pressure. Along with that, I believe that I can be a great advocate on behalf of AND for UCSB students.",Left-leaning,"Good; The 72nd A.S. Senate was given the difficult task of resolving issues on campus after being online for a school year and a half. With all the hurdles dealt to them, I believe they did an adequate job addressing some of the issues at hand. Although, there was a lack of unity amongst the members of senate and that is something that I would like to see changed in the� 72nd A.S. Senate.","No; No, I would vote against a resolution to divest. This happens to be a very personal topic to me. Iabsolutely recognize the struggle of the Palestinian people, but I believe that there are other waysthat we can find a resolution to this issue. Unfortunately, BDS has a great amount of deeply rooted anti-Semitism. That is not something that I or any of us, should stand for as a university with a great amount of Jewish and Israeli identifying students. I am openly Pro-Israel and would be happy to have conversations with individuals throughout the school year about this.","Yes; In an ideal world, I believe that universities should be tuition free to make it an attainable resource for students from all walks of life, but it is out of my jurisdiction as an Off-Campus Senator to have any influence over this.","No, I absolutely do not think that the mental health services at UCSB are adequate. While I appreciate the efforts taken by UCSB and mental health related issues, I believe there is so much more that can be done. I have heard from countless students that they feel like they are unable to use the mental health resources on campus because it takes so long to access and schedule appointments. In order to address these problems, these services should increase the number of trained counselors so that students should not have to wait months to meet with a mental health professional. Along with that, the services should alter their appointment making system to make it easier for those seeking counseling.","While I appreciate the University’s efforts to hold fraternities and sororities accountable for their concerning actions, I believe that there is definitely room for improvement. During the process of holding school-affiliated organizations accountable, the University should make an effort to keep their measures transparent. It is imperative that the student body knows exactly what steps the University is taking to keep their students safe. Situations of sexual assault and hazing are not to be taken lightly and should not be tolerated. If a fraternity or sorority is found to have committed such heinous acts, it is important that the university takes action and openly holds these individuals accountable.","I have become more familiar with Title IX since becoming a student at UCSB. I definitely think it should be something more talked about amongst the student body, being that many students do not know what it is to begin with. There are many things that the university can do to support survivors of sexual assault including making survivors sexual assault and traumatic cases a priority and ensuring that the voices of these students do not go unheard. I plan to work with CARE (Campus Advocacy Resources and Education) in further advocating for survivors and holding the university accountable for their lack of intervention.","No, I do not believe that UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups. Although I cannot speak on behalf of underrepresented groups on campus, I am in support of holding the university accountable for their lack of resources and involvement. I encourage those who feel as though UCSB is not effectively serving them to reach out to different entities on campus. These include: A.S. SCORE (Student Commission on Racial Equity), MCC (Multi-Cultural Center), RCSGD (Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity), and so many more. I hope to urge UCSB to increase diversity amongst professors and faculty so that students of any group feel welcomed and at home. In order to be an effective advocate for these underrepresented groups, I will empower individuals to speak up about their struggles with UCSB and support them through meaningful conversations","As mentioned in various questions above, I am extremely passionate about expanding mental health resources and promoting them to students. My sister is a therapist, and has always taught me to break down barriers and stigmas surrounding mental health. Thus, the first resolution I plan to author if elected to serve on the A.S. Senate would be expanding CAPS and making it so that students have access to more flexible hours and appointments. The way that this could be done is by allocating more funding towards the program so that they could hire more mental health professionals. In this way, students can more easily access the resources offered. Along with that, I would like to promote other resources that students can refer to. Those being: CARE and A.S. Public and Mental Health Commission.","As a senator I plan on creating an Instagram specifically dedicated to keeping the student body informed and involved. On this Instagram I will be sharing specific A.S. related events and important events happening on campus. I will also be linking my office hours schedule, contact information and resources that students are able to refer to when needed. I hope to also make the official A.S. social media more up to date and open about the discussions happening within the senate. I plan on tabling with A.S. to speak directly to students face to face about the current events taking place at school and within the senate. I would also like to hold a quarterly event in which students have free reign to express their concerns, ask questions and bring up ideas to the senate.","I believe that UCSB should continue to provide resources for students in regards to Covid-19. The university should always have a remote or hybrid option for students who are not able to make it to in-person classes when dealing with Covid-19 related issues. I know that I had issues with professors not providing slides or recorded lectures when I dealt with having Covid and it was very difficult for me to stay on top of my classes. There was a lack of flexibility and accommodations these past few quarters and I would really like to better the school’s responsiveness to the student body. Along with that, professors and TA’s at UCSB should continue to encourage students to wear masks and be vigilant about their health as well as the health of others. It is important for the university to continue to follow general health guidelines and continue to be transparent about Covid-19 cases and issues on campus. When health protocols change, so too should the university’s responsiveness to protecting the health of its student body.","While I appreciate the efforts put in by the university in handling the transition into remote learning during the coronavirus pandemic, I believe that there were many things that could have been handled differently. I think that the university acted promptly and responsibly by remaining remote during the height of the pandemic. That being said, there were many issues that I believe that the university could have handled differently including: weekly testing, not relying on self-reported “green badges” and continuing to provide online resources for immunocompromised students. Most of the UCs had mandatory weekly testing. I was shocked to see UCSB not take such precautions, especially at the height of the pandemic. Along with that, it is a slippery slope to trust students with self-reported daily Covid-19 surveys. The green badges were not used in all on campus environments, and should have been enforced more. The lack of online resources has many students worried for their physical health because they are forced to attend in person classes. I really wish that UCSB did not give the professors full reign over deciding whether or not lectures would be online. This should have been a university-wide made decision rather than up to the discretion of each and every professor."
Avery Walters,asumi,Off-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13122426/220408-AveryWalters4shade-KaylaLi.jpg,,she/her,first year,Political Science major ,,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 73rd senate because I am passionate about helping the students here at UCSB and want to maximize their college experience. I catch myself calling Isla Vista and UCSB my home as I have found a community that embraces and supports me in my endeavors. College is a time for growth not just academically but also personally and socially. It is the responsibility of the administration and educators to make this happen, however as senator it is also my responsibility to be a voice for students.While I deeply love the community I have found here, I am able to recognize that there's always room for improvement and the university has its faults. I hope to work on righting these wrongs by truly listening to students voices, advocating for sexual asaault survivors, fighting for accessibility, and increasing communication between students and administration. I hope for students to be able to see the tangible changes being made in the community as well as feel as though these improvements have aided in their education and personal growth. As Off-Campus Senator I want for students' voices to be not only heard, but amplified as we fight for a better UCSB.","While I have not been considerably involved in any groups or activities on campus or in Isla Vista, I do feel connected to this community. I plan on furthering my involvement with UCSB through my work with Associated Students and as a result, with other campus groups such as SASA, STESA, and CARE. I hope to advocate for students by not just listening to their voices, but also amplifying them. I am also a Political Science major and have taken classes pertaining to government and politics both here at UCSB as well as throughout my four years in high school. These classes have given me not just a foundational understanding of how our national government works but also experience with the operations of government and non-profit organizations. Along with an understanding of government, I have taken away great knowledge on politics, current events, and international issues taking place. These classes have taught me that listening to people’s experiences, opinions, and understandings of issues is more important than anything and that is exactly what I plan to do as Off-Campus Senator.","One of my main goals as Off-Campus Senator is to introduce and pass a bill surrounding the safety alerts and communication given to students. This bill would improve communication between students and administration by ensuring that safety alerts are distributed in a more timely manner along with including more information on the situation, in order to truly protect and ensure the safety of all students. Especially with recent events occurring in the community, many students felt unsafe and it is ultimately the responsibility of the school to react to this in a proper and proactive way. I also plan to introduce a resolution addressing the accessibility of femine hygiene products across campus. I want to promote the success of students through tangible changes in the community and on-campus. I plan to work with the Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs who promote and advocate for #MentralEquality4All in order to prevent menstruation from interfering with the education of students. Lastly, I would introduce a bill making mandatory in-person forums addressing sexual assault on college campuses by providing students with education on the proper resources they have access to and Title IX circumstances. I would work with campus organizations such as SASA, STESA, and CARE in order to properly execute this goal.","The overall goal of my platform is to improve the quality of experience students have here at UCSB by breaking down boundaries that inhibit their success, learning and growth. I plan to accomplish this by representing the students of UCSB through listening to their concerns and integrating their voices into the decision-making process within the senate. While I may not be able to experience everything the students here at UCSB deal with, I can and will listen, learn, and sympathize with you. I also plan on improving the accessibility students have by mandating and passing legislation that ensures all students have equal access to free menstrual products across campus. Additionally, I plan on advocating for sexual assault survivors by implementing survivor-oriented policies. One way in which this can be accomplished is with an in-person, mandatory and educational forum centered around the resources and legality surrounding this issue. This educational opportunity is fundamental and would involve close work with on-campus organizations such as SASA, STESA, and CARE who can ensure this is properly implemented. This would give students information about what sexual asault and harassment is, the Title IX process, along with the people and groups on-campus designed to assist them. Lastly, I plan on improving the safety of students and the communication between the school and the community by making safety alerts for immediate and comprehensive. Students should be given safety alerts closer to the time of the incident as well as be given more information regarding the incident. These improvements aim to enhance the college experience of students by removing barriers revolving around education, accessibility, and safety","In order to achieve my platform goals of improving UCSB students and overall college experience I plan to work with and listen to many groups on campus. I believe Students Against Sexual Assualt (SASA) is vital in helping advocate for sexual assault survivors and implementing survivor-oriented policies. SASA aims to educate students about sexual assault, inform them about resources both on and off campus, and increase transparency around sexual assault between the school and community. Along with SASA, I plan to work with Campus Advocacy, Resource, and Education (CARE) which provides students with professional resources regarding not just sexual assault, but also sexual harassment, stalking, and relationship violence. These are all prevalent issues not just among UCSB but campuses across the nation and it is important for students to understand and know that there are resources available to both educate and support them. To further destigmatize conversations surrounding sexual assault, I plan on working with Standing Together to End Sexual Assualt (STESA), which provides students with confidential 24-hour support. By working with these organizations I can advocate for sexual assault, guide students towards resources available to them, and work towards implementing an education forum. I also plan on working with the EVPSA to work towards the goals of #MenstralEquality4All in order to ensure all students have access to free menstrual products around campus.","The basis of my platform is listening to the needs and requests of students and then advocating for them to the administration and my fellow senators. In order to properly facilitate communication between myself and students I will make myself accessible to all students so they can contact me with any questions or concerns. I plan on holding office hours weekly on zoom as well as in-person and also ensuring students can make an appointment with me if my office hours do not fit within their schedules. I will also have an Instagram account designated to communicating with students actions taken by A.S. and the Senate, so students can observe the progress being made. On this Instagram account, I will make my office hours link easily accessible along with my email. Students will also be able to film out a google form, linked on my Instagram, which will allow for them to ask me questions about the school or A.S. as well as address any concerns and complaints they want to make visible to me. I plan on responding to emails and responses on the google form within 24-48 hours to ensure students feel that their voices are being heard. My overall goal is to provide students with multiple different platforms of contact to guarantee their questions are being answered and their concerns addressed.","I am the best candidate for this position because I am passionate about making students’ experience here at UCSB memorable by fighting for tangible changes and ensuring every student’s voice is not just heard, but amplified. I am motivated to give students from all backgrounds the voice they deserve as members of this special community. I have leadership experience with other organizations I was involved with in high school as well as experience with lobbying and the legislative process. I have served as Treasurer for Key Club in high school making me comfortable dealing with money as well as understanding that it is an extreme responsibility. Along with leadership experience I was a lobbyist and chapter representative who worked to pass SB328, a bill aimed at improving the educational experience of students by taking their physical health and biology into consideration. My entire junior and senior years of high school were also dedicated to advocating for sexual assault on college campuses. I started this endeavor by interning for a non-profit organization called Women’s Empowerment which ultimately led to my senior project, presented to my peers as an online forum educating them about sexual assault and Title IX process.",Left-leaning,"Good; These last few years have been very difficult and challenging for both students and administrators as everyone has had to adapt to unfamiliar circumstances in� regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. While I appreciate the flexibility of the 72nd A.S. Senate, there is always room for improvement. Adopting actions and policies that are more responsive to student’s needs and truly puts the voices of our constituents into legislation should always be a priority and the goal of the A.S. Senate.","No; I do not feel as though divestment will solve the issue at hand or accomplish any of the goals students are looking for. While I do not support or condone the actions of the Israeli government, I also understand that universities that approve of divestment have higher rates of anti-seminitism and harassment. I do not condone harassment of any groups and believe that the students safety should be prioritized. BDS is an international issue in which as an Off-Campus Senator I will have no jurisdiction over. However, I am open and committed to listening and learning about the voices of the students here at UCSB.","No; The tuition of students is truly out of my jurisdiction as an Off-Campus Senator, however I do believe that tuition should be made more affordable and feasible for students. The cost of higher education needs to be lowered in order to make it more accessible for lower income and first generation students. I believe the university should continue to financially support lower income students with financial aid along with educationally supporting and guiding first generation students through college resources that they might not be aware of.","I do not feel as though the mental health services offered by UCSB are adequate. Mental health is not just as important as physical health, but is your physical health and should be treated as such. While I appreciate the actions taken by CAPS to ensure students are aware of mental health resources at UCSB, there are a number of issues on which they could improve upon. I have heard from many students that it is difficult to attain an appointment with CAPS due to overbooking and lack of staffing. Students who are able to get an appointment often have to wait weeks for one and then sometimes longer for their next appointment. Appointments should be more accessible for students, especially will all of the changes occurring due to COVID-19 related issues making students have to adapt quickly to unfamiliar circumstances. In order to resolve these issues I would advocate for and work alongside my fellow senators in order to direct funding towards mental health resources. This funding should be directed towards increasing the staffing with the CAPS programs in order to allow for more students to access this resource in a more timely manner.","While I understand that it is difficult for the school to regulate the partying and breaking of social distancing that occurred during these past several years, I do not believe that the school appropriately handled these situations. I believe that the chapters breaking COVID-19 policies should be fined as it is unfair to the chapters who were abiding by the CDC and administrative guidelines. In regards to hazing, I understand that the school put any chapters suspected of hazing under probation while they conducted an investigation and then distributed appropriate punishments to those at fault. Greek Life has a reputation of continued sexual assault, however the university is also at fault for not apporriately handling these incidents. The school takes a more reactive position rather than a proactive and preventative one, allowing for sexual assault to perpetuate at UCSB. The school seems to be more concerned with their reputation rather than the wellbeing of its students which has allowed for them to disregard the concerns of many students for too long. As Off-Campus Senator I plan to work closely with CARE, SASA, and STESA in order to implement survivor-oriented policies that adopt preventative measures and proactive actions in order to advocate for and support sexual assault survivors. While I agree with the goal of Greek Life on campus and believe it can support many students through college, I also acknowledge that it has its faults which need to be addressed by both the A.S. Senate and the administration.","I am very familiar with Title IX issues and its legal process, however I believe that there are always areas in which the university could improve when it comes to Title IX. Many students are simply unaware of what Title IX is, which can be harmful to survivors as the Title IX office and coordinator are designed to be a resource for students. However, I feel as though the university is taking more of a reactive stance towards sexual assault in order to protect their image. Due to this lack of support and preventive action taken by schools, students are prohibited from equal access to education. I believe that the school needs to adopt the SASA demands of improve education about sexual assault, information about resources, and transparency around sexual assault cases in our community. I plan to work with university grous such as SASA, CARE, and STESA, in order to further advocate for survivor of sexual assault and hold the university accounatble for their lack of support and action. Sexual assault on and off this campus is still a prevelant issue, and as an Off-Campus Senator it is my responsibility to listen to survivors and students in order to best advocate for their needs","As I am not a member of one of these groups or communities, I do not want to speak for them. However, I do believe that UCSB could always improve with the representation and resources available to these groups. While I support that the university has taken steps to represent these groups, such as becoming one of the first universities to be a Hispanic Serving Institution, more steps need to be taken. I do not believe that the school has made their institutions and organizations that support historically underrepresented groups, such as the Chicanx/Latinx Cultural Resource Center, well known to the students. A.S. should work towards guiding and educating students on the resources available to them, along with working towards making these organizations more supportive. The university and Associated Students should continue to educate students on and most importantly, perform diversity, equity, and inclusion. As an Off-Campus senator I do not want to speak for these groups, but rather listen to them and then voice their opinions to my fellow senators and the administration. While I may not be able to experience everything the students here at UCSB deal with, I can and will listen, learn, and sympathize with you.","As I mentioned above, if elected to serve on the A.S. Senate, the first bill I plan to author would involve improving the safety alerts given to students. This is one of the more important aspects of my platform, especially due to recent events that occurred in the community. The safety and security of students should always be a top priority of the administrators, educators, and law enforcement. After these events happened in Isla Vista, I was very disappointed with the way in which the university handled it. Along with myself, many of the students I talked with felt unsafe, and the lack of communication given to students contributed to these issues. The safety alerts should be more immediate and given to students closer to the time of incident in order to make students aware of threats to their safety in Isla Vista or on-campus. I also believe these safety alerts should be more comprehensive by including more information the students can use to protect themselves. Some might say that including all information the administrators know then gives the perpetrators more information, however it ultimately gives students information they could use to maintain their safety. No student should feel unsafe on and off campus and feel as though this threat to their safety is impeding on their education","Unfortunately many students are unaware of what A.S. is, how it can help them, or the resources it can offer. As an Off-Campus Senator I want to ensure that students who are living off campus still feel as though they are connected and a part of the school and its community. I plan on involving the study body and keeping them more informed about the A.S. Senate by making myself available to the students. I plan on creating an Instagram specifically for my role as Senator. Social media can be an effective way of reaching out to students, and I will work alongside my fellow senators to ensure that we all use social media as a platform to talk with and listen to students. Regarding my Instagram for my Senate position I plan on posting frequently to inform students of the actions the Senate is taking to improve this university, including the bills and resolutions that we come across along with the various organizations we are working with. My Instagram will also include resources students can use to reach out to me, such as my email, office hours link, and a google form for students to share their opinions and concerns and ask any questions.","One of my main concerns with COVID-19 was professors and educators' lack of resources for students who are uncomfortable attending classes or are unable to attend due to COVID-19. I have taken many classes in which accommodations were subpar and educators lacked flexibility for students dealing with COVID-19 related issues. Whether this is posting lecture slides, recording class, or excusing the absences of students who missed class due to COVID-19, the school needs to step up. Especially with the mask mandate being lifted many students may feel uncomfortable attending in-person classes due to personal or health reasons and the administration and Senate should be responsive to the needs of those students. While I understand educators, professors, and teaching assistants can not personally require students to wear a mask, I believe they should continue to recommend and encourage students to wear masks. The students should also be respectful of the decisions other students make as well as respectful of other people’s health. The university should ensure that students have resources available to them to help them through this transition away from remote learning and the mask mandate.","For myself, when the pandemic hit and I had to transition to remote instruction I found it extremely uncomfortable and draining. From the conversations I have had with other students, many felt similar and found the transition hard. While I appreciate how responsive and immediate the university was with the transition to remote learning as the coronavirus pandemic worsened and cases went up, more could always be done. I think that the university took the health of the students as a priority, relating to COVID, especially with how strongly the mask mandate was enforced and the accessibility of testing. However, the physical and mental health needs of students were not met and many students struggled to keep up with a constantly changing environment. I think that the university could have offered more counseling for students struggling with the transition and also encouraged educators to be more flexible with students. I also believe that the university should have been more strict with enforcing social distancing protocols and placed heavier punishments on students who violated public health guidelines. As the school became more lenient with their enforcement of CDC guidelines, more students felt encouraged to go against public health mandates. Overall, I support the universities decisions to switch to remote learning, however I believe more resources could have been available to students along with stricter punishments for violations of CDC guidelines."
Jessica Klein,sindhu,Off-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13122125/220408-JessicaKlein3shade-KaylaLi.jpg,,she/her,first-year,Global Studies,,,,"While I have enjoyed my time at UCSB so far, there are many issues both off and on campus that need to be addressed. For this reason, I am running for senate because I believe with my hard work and passion I can make significant and essential change to the UCSB and Isla Vista community. The voices of UCSB’s student body must be heard, and as senate I will ensure that the change we all deserve and need is the change we will see.","As a first year student who was impacted by COVID the past two quarters, I have sadly been unable to join many clubs. However, I have been involved in a few organizations that pertain to my identity; including weekly events at Chabad and Hillel. These organizations provided an important opportunity for me to connect with many different students across all grades and areas both on campus and throughout Isla Vista. Through weekly meals and activities at Chabad and Hillel I was able to become a part of the Jewish community at UCSB. While I have not had much of an opportunity to be involved with UCSB so far, I am eager to join Associated Students and use my High School leadership experience to make an impact on the UCSB and Isla Vista community.  ","As a senator, I would pass bills and resolutions that focus primarily on addressing the following three pressing issues; sustainability, accessibility, and safety. In order to make our campus more ecologically sustainable we must assess issues within our dining halls and the amount of food waste that dining commons produce. Extensive amounts of food are thrown away everyday, this trash accumulating from leftover food on student’s plates and untouched food goes to waste. I would issue a bill requiring the university to have compost in the dining hall; so the leftover food on students' plates will not be thrown in trash. Another pressing issue is many students who require accommodations’ needs are not being met. As a senator, I will pass a bill to issue funding for the providing of essential products such as menstrual products and contraception. These products will be located at various points throughout campus, such as the University Center and the library, and ensure that students have access to necessities. Another bill I will pass will allocate funding to the school libraries, ensuring that students have additional access to required readings and textbooks. Lastly, I will pass bills to address safety concerns as well as mental health necessities that result from this campus’ failing protection of students. One safety issue that will be addressed is I will pass a bill that better funds our blue light alarm systems stationed on and around campus. Currently, our alarm systems are underfunded and lacking in the ability to properly support the student boy. These safety systems allow students to simply press a button that will alert authorities if they feel unsafe, but I will strive to implement more of these systems. I will also pass a bill allocating additional funding and resources to mental health institutions on campus such as CAPS and SASA. ","My platform as senator will focus on transparency and connection with all students and will address the needs of the student body. As an off campus senator, representing the voices of students living in the Isla Vista area is an essential component of my platform. I will ensure that all students, off campus and on campus, are heard by focussing on three many goals; sustainability, accessibility, and safety. Sustainability is a huge issue for many off campus residents. Many university-run facilities off campus are failing to meet environmental concerns. For example, a lack of essential compost and recycling systems are prevalent throughout Isla Vista. My platform will address this issue by allocating additional trash systems and pressuring facilities to comply.  Another sustainability issue is found in the university dining halls through the amount of food that is consistently wasted. My platform will work to address this issue by passing bills to require a sufficient composting system. Another part of my campaign will be addressing accessibility and availability issues. I will ensure that the needs of the student body are met by allocating resources to fund the dispersion of menstrual products and contraceptives, as well as funding textbooks and required readings in the library. Lastly, my platform will focus largely on the safety and health of the student body. One way that I will achieve this is through implementing additional safety systems such as alert systems that will be stationed at and around campus. Additionally, mental health is an incredibly pressing issue for college students and my platform will address this by directing additional funding and resources to mental health organizations on campus.","As Off-Campus senator it is my responsibility to work with various organizations to ensure that essential platforms are met. For my sustainability platform I will work with organizations who will ensure that the university complies with necessary measures to obtain an eco-friendly campus; including organizations like the Zero Waste Committee and the Isla Vista Compost Collective. Additionally, I will work with organizations such as CAPS, SASA, and CARE to strive for the receipt of additional funding and resources.","Transparency and communication with the student body is a fundamental component of the A.S. senate. As senator, I will ensure communication with my constituents via various resources online and in person. For example, I will create an Instagram account that is entirely dedicated to my platform as senate. The account will ensure that I connect with the student body and notify my constituents of current events within the campus senate. I will post updates on new bills and resolutions, ideas for my future plans, and polls on my Instagram story. Furthermore, I will attach a linktree to my Instagram containing links to office hours via zom, my email, and google forms. Weekly office hours will be held through zoom as well as additional one-on-one appointments that can be scheduled through google forms or email.  ","In order to properly serve the student body, there are many qualities that off-campus senators must have; including a strong work ethic, an ability to connect with others, and a passion for mending the underlying issue that our university faces. I believe that I have each of these qualities, and therefore, I can serve the student body through my work with Associated Students. First of all, I have a strong work ethic; throughout high school and college I have managed a vast amount of projects, courses, and leadership roles. Additionally, I believe that I will be able to sufficiently connect with the student body and make sure that their voices are heard. I will achieve this through a social media platform that will connect me with my constituents. Lastly, I have the passion and drive to change the issues that this university faces. I feel strongly about all three of my platforms – sustainability, accessibility, and safety – and I know that with hard work I can ensure that the student body receives the results that they deserve. I plan on using my passion to create bills that will allocate funds to resolve these underlying issues in our university’s administration. ",Left-leaning,"Very good, Overall, the A.S. The Senate has sufficiently met the needs of the UCSB student body. However, I do believe that there is more the senate could be doing to connect with their constituents. For example, the vast majority of the students are unaware of the role that A.S. plays on campus, and thus are unable to convey their needs adequately to the senate. While the actions of the senate have sufficiently addressed the needs of the student body, I do believe that they could be doing more to directly connect with individuals. ","No, Many are suffering at the hands of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but BDS is not the answer. First of all, I believe BDS is antisemitic. BDS singles out one country surrounded by dozens of countries that have committed equally horrendous war crimes and human rights violations.It is unjust that this country is the only Jewish state in the world. Additionally, the effect that BDS has on campus communities cause surges in hatred and antisemitism. UCSB is not a campus that tolerates hatred of any kind; including aggression towards our Jewish community. Secondly, BDS does not actually resolve the conflict. One example in 2014 was divestment from SodaStream company in the West Bank which resulted in many workers losing their job; most of whom were Palestinian workers. This is an incredibly complex and nuanced conflict resulting from thousands of years of historical context and, in the last century, complex geo-political actions.  ","Yes, I believe that education is a right, not a privilege; and therefore universities should be made accessible to everyone including those that are able to afford it. However, as a member of the senate it is not in my jurisdiction to determine the cost of tuition.","I believe that our campus at UCSB has many resources to support students struggling with mental health issues. However, these resources are underfunded and understaffed and accompany a vast amount of problems when attempting to schedule appointments. When scheduling an appointment with UCSB programs such as CAPS or CARE counseling sessions are overbooked and wait times are extensive. I have heard of many experiences from students who have been unable to schedule an appointment until months following their initial request. Even after long wait times to begin sessions, students are only afforded monthly appointments which often are inadequate for their needs of resolving mental health issues. Mental health is a fundamental component of college life and many young adults struggle with mental health problems. An inability to receive adequate support will adversely impact the student body and can lead to academic as well as social issues. Therefore, I believe that these programs require additional funding and resources to ensure that students obtain the necessary health resources that they deserve. As senator I will strive to author a bill ensuring that the mental health programs on campus receive additional funding so that the needs of the student body at UCSB can be adequately addressed.","The UCSB and Isla Vista community has a fundamental and persistent issue with sexual assualt and violence; and it is essential that any allegations pertaining to sexual assualt are addressed. Sexual assualt is a serious issue that cannot be taken lightly and currently this university is failing to take appropriate action in preventing their students from traumatic and violent harm. The universty has not appropriately handled student’s reports of sexual assualt and allegations are not being heard or sufficently addressed. Many students who are victims of incidents of sexual assualt are not taken seriously by our campus administration and often causes the victim more harm and leaves the perpetrator unpunished and guilt free. For these reasons, I do not believe that our university has appropriately handled allegations of sexual assualt and violence. School affiliated organizations should be held accountable for addressing allegations by creating resolutions and bills that require the university to take allegations seriously and adequately investigate any claims made by sexual assualt victims. Sexual assualt can cause detrimental and lasting effets on sexual assualt survivors lives; including mental health issues and leading to academic decline. Therefore, it is essential that measures to prevent sexual assualt are implimented and sexual assualt allegations are addressed.  ","I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its function to support gender equality. UCSB’s Title IX services were a step in the right direction, however, I do not believe that the university adequately supports sexual assualt survivors. There is a lot more that this campus can be do to address our underlying and persistant issue with sexual assualt. For example, the university administration should approve the resources and facilities – such as CAPS, CARE, and SASA – that they provide. Resources on campus are incredibly underfunded and understaffed and therefore are unable to provide the necessary support for sexual assualt survivors. Additionally, many reports of sexual assualt allegations are not sufficently adressed by the UCSB administartion. I have heard of many accounts of sexual assualt victims being unable to reach justice in the form of punishmnet against their perpetrator. Therefore, I believe that the UCSB administration should expand upon their investigations against sexual assualt allegations.","I believe that it is essential that the UCSB administration and community supports our diverse population of students and represents minority groups that are often underrepresented. While I am not a member of one of these groups of students, and do not want to speak for them, I do not believe that this university is adequately supporting underrepresented and minority populations of our student body. I will make it a priority to reach out to leaders of clubs on campus that represent minority groups and learn about the experiences of those who are affected by UCSB’s lack of support. As an off-campus senator, I will ensure that the voices of all students, including those who are often overlooked and underrepresented, are heard and their needs are addressed. I will meet with groups such as the Black Student Union, the Queer and Trans Student Union, and Decolonizing Our Lives Project (DOLP) to discuss what specific measure need to be taken to support their needs and how I can allocate funding and resources to most effectively support minority students.","An incredibly pressing issue at UCSB is the lack of availability for essential items across campus. As senate, I want to ensure that all students have access to vital resources in order to maintain a thriving community that supports the entire student body. To do this, I will author a bill that allocates funding for the dispersion of menstrual products and contraceptives located at various points throughout campus. With this bill, students will no longer have to worry about obtaining the bare minimum essential resources. Instead, the student body can focus more time on their school and academic environment rather than spending energy and time on items that should be allocated by the UCSB administration. The bill will also allocate money to other essential items by ensuring that the school library receives additional resources and can properly distribute required reading and textbooks. Textbooks are vital components of learning for many of the UCSB courses; and when not provided to the student body many students are forced to spend hundreds of dollars on textbooks that they can afford. Thus, as senate, my bill will ensure that the student population has access to essential items by distributing additional funding to resources that students need.","As a student at UCSB I understand how important it is to have proper communication and transparency with the student body and ensure that constituents know how their tuition money is being allocated. For these reasons, I will make it a priority to better the communication between constituents and the senate. One useful tool for connecting with the student body, especially with those in our generation, is via social media and online platforms. When elected as off-campus senate, I will create an Instagram account solely dedicated to connecting with the student body and informing them about decisions and the specific actions that are taken by our student government. This Instagram account will contain a linktree with various methods of communicating with me. The linktree will include a zoom link for weekly office hours, google forms where students can submit suggestions, complaints, or questions, and my email address where I will be dedicated to responding within a 24 hour period. Additionally, I will post on my Instagram story various polls and other questions so I can hear directly from my constituents and adequately adapt to their specific needs and concerns. Through taking these necessary steps, I believe I can sufficiently involve the student body with the ongoings of Associated Students and allow for a more inclusive and understanding student government.","I understand that the COVID-19 pandemic led to unforeseen and unprecedented events and that the university did what they could to implement policies that protect the health of the student body. However, I believe that while our university attempted to adjust to a new environment under a pandemic, UCSB could have done a lot more to preserve the health and safety of students. One example is UCSB did not have sufficient quarantining policies or options. While I understand that there were a few small designated areas for students who needed to quarantine, these areas were unable to accommodate the vast majority of students affected by the virus. UCSB should have been able to adapt to the pandemic and better accommodate students by ensuring that everyone had access to quarantine facilities. Moreover, these facilities should have provided food services to ensure that students experiencing symptoms of COVID did not have to worry about food options or contaminate others by leaving their quarantine to eat. Since the quarantining options were not sufficient, the virus spread more rapidly at the fault of UCSB administration. Another way that UCSB did not adequately support their student body through the COVID-19 pandemic is that there were not sufficient resources for students struggling with mental health due to the pandemic. After a year of quarantining college life was a huge adjustment for many and the underfunded mental health programs were unable to adequately care for the student body. ","The period of transition between a pandemic and post-pandemic campus will be a vital time to ensure that the safety and health of the students are protected. One way that the university should help to maintain safety among the student population is through providing sufficient quarantining areas. It is almost guaranteed that at least a small percentage of the student body will be infected with the COVID-19 virus in the coming months and year. However, if the UCSB administration provides facilities in which students can adequately quarantine the health and safety of the rest of the population will be protected. It is essential that we contain the virus as much as possible in the coming months to ensure that the pandemic does not become an even more persistent issue. Moreover, under the circumstance that the university is unable to contain the spreading of the virus, it is essential that the school initiates an additional resolution to require masks again. It is essential that UCSB takes the proper precautions to ensure that the health of the student body is protected and that there is an adequate learning environment."
Sohum Kalia,sindhu,Off-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13132143/220408-SohumKalia-JoshuaYepezMartinez.jpeg,,all pronouns,second year,Biochemistry,,,,"Honestly? Cuz I’m tired of the current administration's bullshit. UCSB administration has failed to meet the most basic needs of its students. Ever since I stepped foot on campus, I have been doing everything in my power to advocate for my peers in response to university incompetence. As hall council president of my dorm I have seen first hand how this administration's ineptitude affects real individuals. Our peers struggle with many issues, usually at the fault of the university: floundering in a hostile and confusing system designed for the admin, not the students. 
I have sent countless emails to admin regarding issues such as predatory housing fees, unfair judicial processes, extreme anti-transparency practices and a concerning aversion to student advocacy all to no avail. I could not stand by and watch my peers suffer such callous leadership. I created The Office of Residential Advocacy to provide my peers something we have been desperately missing: an advocate that can fight housing injustices directly. As the Residential Advocate General I have been able to directly assist students facing the universities failings in management. 
But I am tired of putting out fires set by the current admin. We need a senate who is not afraid to take this fight directly to the Chancellor. I have and will continue to be a representative working tirelessly to make the voices of my constituents heard in the face of a deaf and uncaring administration.","I have been extremely involved in both student leadership and student advocacy organizations. I was elected president of my dorm, anacapa, where I saw first hand how this administration's ineptitude affects real individuals. This led me to create the Office of Residential Advocacy and act as the Residential Advocate General. As the Residential Advocate General I have been able to directly assist students facing the universities failings in management. After a meeting with current president Yuval Cohen I was offered the opportunity to merge my independent office with AS and permanently fill this gap in advocacy between housing and residents. In the winter quarter my efforts in advocacy and peer support were noticed and I was chosen to be appointed as an on campus senator. Rarely do Senators serve two terms in AS, as a result every senate is filled with people inexperienced in their roles. As someone who has had the opportunity to understand the internal workings of the senate, I would be able to help other senators elected realize their projects and assist them in bringing an idea, onto paper legislation, into meaningful action",I do not want another senate that does not meet the needs of the student body. I would like to author and pass a resolution in the first senate meeting detailing the duties and responsibilities of a senator and reaffirm the senate's commitments to the student body. I would also like to pass resolutions urging the academic senate to require all lectors to provide recorded options as well as relaxing mandatory attendance requirements.,"My platform is simple: students > administration. This university exists for students, and students rights / advocacy are the most important items of my platform. This current administration has failed to support its student body sufficiently. I would go as far as to say the current administration has been hostile towards its student body, specifically in terms of student run advocacy and transparency. To me this is unacceptable and I will continue to fight for my peers just as I have in the past as the Residential Advocate General.","I plan to work closely with any and all relevant internal AS committees to realize all of my platform goals. Importantly, I plan to work far closer with the office of the chancellor than past senates to strengthen that communication between student body and administration and to hold administrators accountable.",I plan to hold in-person and zoom office hours open to all students and staff. I also plan to keep my senatorial instagram up to date with everything I'm working on as well as important AS initiatives and news.,"I believe my vast experience with student advocacy as well as experience as an AS senator makes me an ideal candidate. I pride myself in being extremely passionate about the student body, not just another poli-sci major looking to pad their resume but a student who cares about their peers and wants to make a difference.",left-leaning,"Poor, Please explain (less than 100 words): I feel that the 72nd As senate has done a good job of addressing the needs of the 72nd A.S. senate and the needs of AS. As far as the needs of the student body,  The 72nd senate has done a wonderful job of debating meaningless virtue signals. The senate has not made a meaningful impact on the actual student body during a time when the student body needs support the most. Someone needs to stand up for the student body, the 72nd senate has failed to do so.","No, Man I’ma be real, I am a student government senator. Is this an important and powerful position that should be taken by a passionate and serious representative? Absolutely. Do I have any influence on middle eastern conflicts? Hell no. Israel and Palestine don’t give a shit what ASUCSB on campus senator has to say. I can’t influence that conflict. What I can do is assist my constituents and peers in numerous ways outlined in my platform.","Yes, Don’t get me wrong, the A.S. senate has quite a bit of power and must be filled with people who are passionate and will work hard to support and advocate for its student body. That being said, we are not the United States senate. The A.S. senate does not get to decide the price of tuition. In my opinion, questions and promises like these are dangerous to a student government. In my opinion, I and other potential senators should not be making any sort of promises as extreme as free tuition. Let's do things we can do, like empowering student run advocacy, without promising things we are incapable of delivering.","Hell no. Have you seen the CAPS queue? It's like T + 4 months on a CAPS appointment. First I believe a senate resolution supporting an inquiry into administrations contributions to CAPS and its functions would be a good idea. A significant portion of AS lock in funding goes towards CAPS, I feel that it would be the senate's obligation to insure that these funds are used to improve the lives of its students. A hearing and consultation with CAPS leadership and dean of mental health and wellness would shed light on the pitfalls and bottlenecks holding our campus’s mental health services back and what we as students can do to support ourselves, as well as what administration can do to better support its student body.","I do not believe the university has handled these matters to a satisfactory extent. I have been working with SASA and other senators, and will continue to do so, in order to introduce legislation to provide the student body with personal safety devices and install police call boxes around isla vista.
For too long Greek life has lived on its own separate island at UCSB. As senator, I will introduce legislation to create a system of greek life liaisons and communications with AS. I believe introducing bridges between Greek life and the rest of the student body will be beneficial to both.","I am very familiar with the Title IX office and have referred multiple students to their resources as Residential Advocate General. I have found the Title IX office to be surprisingly competent and capable. I belive that in concerns to sexual assult, UCSB has quality resources but has failed to make them sufficently available to the student body.","As a fairly new member of AS I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a wonderfully welcoming and inclusive community of students. UCSB as a whole has more resources and inclusivity initiatives than many other schools. That being said, nothing is perfect and UCSB is far from an exception. There can always be progress made in fighting injustice and supporting inclusion.",I do not want another senate that does not meet the needs of the student body. I would like to author and pass a resolution in the first senate meeting detailing the duties and responsibilities of a senator and reaffirm the senate's commitments to the student body.,I personally knew nothing about AS until a few months ago when I was appointed as a senator. I believe AS needs to be far more involved in the daily life of the student. As a senator I have and will continue to involve myself in residence hall councils to keep as many of my constituents informed on AS news and initiatives that could affect them. ," I believe that while we are finally starting to free ourselves from the pandemic, student health and safety should always come first. I supported a resolution to urge the academic senate to require all lectures be recorded so students do not feel pressured to attend classes when they may have been exposed to a contagious illness. As senator I will take this further and demand the academic senate integrate hybrid options into our education system so students can always keep up with their education without sacrificing their safety or that of their peers.","I still hear stories of my friends and peers feeling pressured to attend lectures and sections despite feeling ill. I believe every lecture should be recorded so that students can always have the option to isolate themselves in case they feel ill or have been recently exposed. I feel that the only place the university really succeeded with their pandemic plan was in their relaxed covid drop, p/np, and withdrawal policies."
Yael Berukhim ,sindhu,Off-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13121717/220408-YaelBerukhim3shade-KaylaLi.jpg,,she/her,first year,Undeclared,,,,I am running to be a senator in the 73rd senate to be a representative of the student body and ensure that the concerns of students are heard by the administration. UCSB has such a community of students who are passionate about Isla Vista and UCSB so much. Being able to represent such a special student community on the level of an Off-Campus Senator would be such an honor. ,"This past year I’ve felt so welcomed by the Isla Vista and UCSB community with many experiences that ensure my preparedness to be a senator. I currently reside off-campus at Tropicana Gardens when I others who live off-campus and can hear and relate to the struggles and benefits that come with this. Similarly, I’m involved in Greek Life at UCSB which allows me to reach another aspect of the student body. I am also very passionate about the legislative process. Many clubs I was involved in throughout high school, mainly Youth and Government allowed me opportunities to model the California Senate and understand debates around hot button issues. These programs also taught me to listen to other people’s opinions before I give my own, as this is the only way to make real, lasting change. ","first resolution I would like to introduce while in office is to bring back late-night dining. Student schedules are all over the palace and often times time devoted to eating does not
align with the dining hall hours of operation. Having late-night dining allows students opportunities to eat at the dining hall in spite of hectic schedules during the day. I would also like to introduce a bill surrounding composting in the dining halls. The dining halls on campus and the students that eat in them produce so much food waste. Having a compost bin available for food waste would not only reduce the toll such waste takes on the planet but could be used to increase plant life and health on UCSB’s campus. Furthermore, I would introduce a bill attempting to increase outdoor study spaces with outlets. Walking around campus I always notice an inadequate amount f students studying at outdoor tables specifically in electric outlets. Increasing the amount of these spaces available encourages students to get outside, socialize, and study efficiently on our beautiful campus. ","My platform entails four main points: representing typically underrepresented students, increasing student involvement on campus, expanding CAPS service accessibility, and enacting more climate-friendly resolutions. I will achieve my goals by working with the administration on campus, as well as finding efficient ways to connect to students and my constituents. To represent underrepresented students I will reach out to clubs and organizations, like the Transfer Student Center and Disabled Students Program, to hear the opinions of students in these groups. To increase student involvement I will encourage tabling and club fairs in more organized fashions such as themed club days. Having a community service club day, political club day, and so on with other broad categories clubs can fall into will help students become involved with groups they truly are passionate about. To expand CAPS service availability I will talk to CAPS administration to help better understand why there is such limited ability and target specific areas that need assistance. Finally, I will find more climate-friendly ways of operating campus activities by also meeting with campus administration to discuss things like composting in the dining hall and less paper usage. ","I will work with student organizations that assist underrepresented students (Disabled Students Program, Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, & American Indian and Indigenous Cultural Resource Center, just to name a few) to hear the concerns and needs of these specific groups. Furthermore, I will work with CAPS, UCSB administration, and staff who run dining and campus operations to initiate resolutions surrounding mental health services and environmental sustainability. ","I will make myself available to my constituents through social media, email, phone, and in-person throughout the 2022-2023 school year to hear all their concerns and viewpoints. Social media is a great resource since it has the power to reach many students. Instagram polls and making my email readily available to my constituency are specific ways I will make myself available. I will do my best to adhere to my constituent’s schedules and be flexible about the times I can meet up with them to best hear all perspectives. ","I am the best candidate for this position because of my attentiveness and drive to represent student concerns and amplify them in the Senate. Making myself available through multiple means, like by email, social media, or in person, to hear student concerns and reach out to groups that aren’t typically heard in the Senate is my top priority. As a Senator, bridging the gap between students and administration will be of utmost importance to me. ",Centrist,"Very Good, The 72nd Senate was attentive to student needs and truly did its best to support them. One thing that sticks out is the Safety Task Force’s reimbursement program for students who uber to and from campus at night. This program was a useful and efficient response to safety concerns by the student body. However, there is always room to do more and be better in the case of representing the whole student body and addressing the concerns of more students. 
","No,  I am against sanctions against Israel. Not only do campuses that pass divestment against Israel have increased accounts of attacks against Jewish students, but divestment places an obvious double standard on Israel as other countries have participated in comparable human rights violations. This double standard is clearly due to antisemitism which our campus should not encourage and singles out Jewish students making them feel uncomfortable and unsafe on our campus. ","Yes, Ideally, yes, UCSB would have free or highly reduced tuition to make education accessible to even more people without finances posing a barrier. While I believe college at some sort of cost betters the institution, the University should not be heavily profiting, as it does right now, off students trying to earn a degree. However, as an Off-Campus Senator, this decision is out of my control. ","While UCSB mental health services, mainly CAPS, do serve students, the services are not adequate to serve the large student body. Trying to make an appointment at CAPS is like sitting on a DP curb on a Friday night without getting ticketed, almost impossible. Having more trained counselors to provide CAPS services so that students wouldn’t have to book months in advance to meet with mental health professionals is one effective way to address this problem. ","In terms of sororities and fraternities specifically, I believe the university needs to be more transparent about the punishments they enact on sororities and fraternities, as I do believe they are holding these organizations accountable for the described wrongdoings, and continue to hold them accountable. However, they should be doing more to hold school-affiliated organizations responsible for allegations that come out about them with extra attention paid to resources for victims and survivors of sexual assault, health protocol violations, and hazing.
","I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its functions and believe the university should be doing more to support survivors of sexual assualt. While services like Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education (CARE) are available on campus, CARE should be expanded to reach more survivors and students struggling with assault. Handling assault cases and ensuring survivors do not go unheard and overlooked should be more of a priority for the university. ","No. While the school has some programs available to members of these underrepresented groups, not enough is being done by UCSB to serve them effectively. One aspect this is abundantly clear is representation amongst UCSB faculty. Increasing the diversity of UCSB faculty immediately makes the campus a more welcoming place to underrepresented groups who feel seen by faculty that come from similar backgrounds as them. ","The first resolution or bill I would introduce is a resolution to expand dining hall hours and bring back late-night dining. Student schedules are all over the place and oftentimes do not align with dining hours. Furthermore, clubs and extracurricular organizations often meet in the evening from 7:00 to 9:00 pm making it even more difficult for students to find time to eat after a day full of classes. Late-night dining hours would ensure students have access to satisfying meals even at non-traditional hours and ensure students properly care for themselves and their bodies. This is why I will aim to bring late-night dining back to UCSB dining halls, to improve student well-being and ensure students' needs (as basic as eating) are cared for by the school.","As a Senator, I will prioritize making myself available through social media as well as in-person to hear all student concerns. Social media is a great way to connect to students outside of people I regularly interact with. I will also use social media to publicize Senate movements and important agenda items so students can feel more connected to student wants and needs. ","The Senate and university should pay extra attention to student responses after the mask mandate is lifted. If COVID cases spike after this change, a motion to reestablish the mask mandate and other COVID protocols, like testing, should be pushed by the Senate. If students are happy with this change and no large risks to student health are seen by the Senate or university then the university should move forward with the lifting of the mask mandate and other COVID policies while continuing to monitor COVID numbers and provide testing","I believe the university did a subpar job handling the coronavirus pandemic during my time at UCSB. While many other schools required weekly COVID testing to combat the pandemic UCSB failed to do so. Students at the school were also not required to be vaccinated against COVID at the start of the year, putting general student health at even higher risk. Furthermore, no regard was paid to student mental health with few and far between CAPS appointments were available and most of the pandemic-related expectations were made by professors, not the school. If the school had taken a stronger stance on how professors were to handle remote
instruction a lot of student confusion could have been avoided with all professors sharing similar policies."
"Shihao ""Eddie"" Zong",atmika,On-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13131830/220407-ShihaoZong-JoshuaYepezMartinez.jpeg,,he/him,first-year,Economics,,,,"I am running to become a senator with the 73rd senate because I want to represent the
student body and empower their voice within the community, the university, the state
government and beyond.","I have dedicated myself to advocating for students' interests with numerous beneficial
projects.
In response to the number of violent cases occurring around the campus community, I,
with support from the internal vice president, , immediately took action to address student
concerns by creating the Campus Student Safety Project. I have discussed with the Vice
Chancellor Margaret Klawunn and Chief of Police Alex Yao about hosting upcoming events to
increase student awareness and protection. Please join us in the effort of making the campus a
better place for all.
Moreover, on March 7 from 17:30 to 23:00, I joined the Blue Light Safety Walk, with
Chief of Police Alex Yao and Dean of Student Wellness Angela Andrade and many others, to
inspect campus’s safety lighting and equipment in order to ensure the safety of the student
body. Our inspections were very fruitful and I have been working with university administrations
to work out the details of those improvements to meet the needs of the student body.
In addition, I have been actively advocating with State Senator Scott Wiener to expand
financial aid and on-campus housing in order to meet the needs of UCSB students. I believe
that the state legislature should allocate more state funding in higher education.","There are three bills/resolutions that I would like to introduce to the 73rd
Senate. The first one is to increase on campus housing opportunities. The second
one is to improve residential security and safety measures. The third is to install
better residential hall facilities.","For the first point, I will advocate, with the help from UC Student Association, for a
larger budget from the state legislatures and university to increase On-Campus Housing
that aims to build a safe, healthy and comfortable living environment for the students.
For the second point, I will push for a larger budget allocated toward Residential
security and safety measures that reduce the risk of crimes such as bike thief and other
negative activities that impact the student’s life.
Finally for the third point, I will advocate for better facilities, like better WiFi, in the
residential hall to increase the overall living quality.
Moreover, I want to make this year more enjoyable and active for many students
who had their college life restricted inside a video conference. I will organize frequent,
COVID friendly events, both in person and online, to make our community “alive” again.","I would love to work with the university administration about campus planning for
increasing the student body, and also interact with the State Legislatures to increase
funding towards the UC to increase on campus housing opportunity without collecting
charging funds from the students.
I will also work with the 400+ student organizations on campus to host various in
person and online activities and events to rebuild our Gaucho community after COVID.
Time doesn’t wait for anyone, so we need to take action now to “re-activate” our
community. I want to make UCSB a safe place for all students to experience this once in
a lifetime “college life”.","My office hours will always be open towards all students regardless of their
backgrounds. I will host weekly office hours, both remote and in person, to
meet the demands of every student.","In the short amount of time that I spent within AS, I have already devoted my
time and efforts to advocating for students' interest in various activities, projects and
achievements. And produced significant progress in my effort of making the campus a
better place.",(a) Left-leaning,"Excellent. The 72nd A.S. Senate had a lot of important accomplishments regarding
COVID prevention during the winter quarter. For instance, there is a resolution that is
passed to urge the academic senate to require recorded lectures for students who
are unable to attend in person lectures. This act has effectively maintained the high
quality education offered at UCSB while reducing the risk of transmitting potential
diseases thus protecting the entire student body.","No, Every human who is born into this world has rights. Regardless of whatever it is Israelian's human rights, or palestinian’s rights, human rights should be universal across anyone.Therefore, we should devote our efforts to protect the rights of everyone, not
just a group of people or another. However, this issue has been a decades-long, complex international politics concern that many of the professional politicians or advisors still debate about. And as an undergraduate student at UCSB, I don’t believe I have the knowledge required to be able to make meaningful contributions regarding this. Therefore I am open to listen to the opinions and concerns of the students while I am senator.","No, Although this proposal sounded nice at first, ultimately, it will harm the students most. The University depends on our tuition to offer the high quality education we deserve. However, we should focus on advocating for more State funding towards the UC. In the recent California State Budget act of 2021, the state had around $23
billions of budget surplus from previous years. Advocating for more state budget will effectively solve this issue while maintaining a high quality education.","I believe that the mental health services that UCSB offers are very
comprehensive. The Office of Student Wellness sent out weekly emails presenting the
students with a whole wide range of mental health services. However, the mental health services should also offer more comprehensive counseling services to address a border bandwidth of needs.","The university should implement a better safety system like more comprehensive emergency notifications, better lightning, and overall increase student awareness about self protections and crime prevention. In general, the university should take more actions against student misconduct on campus in order to build a safe and comfortable environment for the student body.","I believe that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is very important in making the campus environment more diverse, at the same time more comfortable to any students, regardless of their gender orientations. Gender orientations should not be a barrier to isolate a certain group of community, or to be a subject of abuse and hatred. The university should provide more comprehensive, interactive training regards to sexual misconduct to further increase the student’s awareness about those topics. I will also work with various on campus organizations like CAPS and SASA to address gender inequality concerns. Of course, I would love to hear more from the students about their opinions and suggestions regarding these issues.","The Student Resources building offers a wide range of services towards underrepresented communities. Students from a variety of backgrounds can all gather in one place to learn, innovate and exchange ideas and cultures. The Student Resource Building also provided many culture centers for minority groups to interact with people from similar background This action have created a path to those underrepresented community to access the high quality higher education","The first bill that I plan to author if I am elected to serve on the A.S. Senate is to quickly provide appropriate solutions towards addressing the urgent needs of on campus housing from the students. Housing shortages have always been a big concern to the students, and I want to be the backbone in the 73rd Senate to address this issue.","As a Senator, it is my job to reach out towards the students. I believe that frequent, impactful student activities should be held to increase the interaction between the A.S. as a whole with the student body. There are still a lot of students who are unaware of the resources and benefits that the Associated Students can provide them. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by effective communication between the students and the associations. The COVID pandemic has put many student activities on campus to a halt, and I will create more events, both online and in person, to restore the dynamic and interactive atmosphere on campus. That way, the students can feel more comfortable and confident to interact with the Associate Students.","If elected as a senator, I will increase interaction with the students to understand
the needs of the students and take appropriate actions to address those concerns. My
office hours will always be open towards students who want to talk with me about their
problems.","These past years of the covid pandemic brought tragedy to the nation. Many of our dear ones suffer from the disease, and the whole nation is thrown into chaos. In the light of this disaster, the university took immediate action, complying with the CDC
instructions and State government instructions, effectively reducing this global pandemic’s damages to a minimum. However, many criticize the university for not doing enough to further reduce the damages brought by the pandemic. But many of them forget about the crisis that we face as a nation, not just a college campus."
Ehsan Varnous,atmika,On-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13132017/220408-EhsanVarnous-EmmettRuhland.jpg,,he/him,second-year,Middle-East Studies,,,,"I believe that I can truly make an impact at UCSB. Everyday I notice more that could be done to better our community and I'm stepping up to finally solve these issues which I'm so passionate about. It simply isn't enough for me to only be a student, and it's become my duty to take action in order to fully embody that Gaucho spirit. I'd like to contribute to making campus life more pleasurable for students. I want to provide students who don't have a voice in the Senate a chance to speak up. I want to provide quick and easy access to resources for students who are struggling with their mental health. I want to dedicate myself to the students, being the voice I wish I had when I first came to UCSB. ","Just this past year, I joined the AS Office of the President, Yuval Cohen, working as the Technology Media Coordinator. I've familiarized myself with the in's and outs of AS, and developed the skills which have prepared me to work with my peers. I watched as our campus fluctuated with uncertainty from continuing online instruction to quickly resuming in-person activities. Through my position, I've discovered how much potential there is to develop policies that have a real impact; there are substantial school resources that a leader like myself can tap into to enrich the community and improve the lives of students. As a senator, I'll be able to use the school's funding and collaborate with the administration to get things done. I've gained a better grasp of the complex and formal system that student leaders must follow, and I've witnessed firsthand that, despite the complexity, enacting policies is still very doable if done efficiently and smartly. I want to put my experience to good use as a senator, creating events and policies that support my agenda. ","1. The Ramadan Bill: Making space for on-campus celebrations, providing time for students to honor Ramadan without academic penalties, and protecting students from anti-Muslim discrimination can support students who celebrate this holy month. Allow students to take time for prayer, worship, and gathering during Ramadan without academic consequences or penalties. Students may need to miss class or other commitments to honor and celebrate throughout the holy month. This would also ensure that faculty and staff learn about Ramadan. Understanding the principles of Ramadan can help colleges create safe spaces for students. Muslim students can better advocate for their needs when faculty understand Ramadan. 
2. The Walk Your Wheels Bill: Everyday on campus, I see students rushing to class, some on foot and some on bikes or skateboards. At times, these students neglect the designated bike paths and walking areas, leading to overwhelming traffic and genuine safety hazards. I was one of these students a few quarters ago, thinking I could just speed past some pedestrians on a narrow walkway. This in turn led to a tragic accident, practically totalling my bike. Although my intentions were to only get to my destination faster, I put the welfare of my fellow students and myself at risk. Even with the imposed threat of a fine for the students who fail to walk their wheels in designated walking areas, nobody listens. This bill would ensure that some type of further enforcement is put in place, guaranteeing the safety of students and bikers alike. 
3. The NewGround Resolution: I envision a UCSB where Muslims and Jews are empowered to create lasting partnerships, engage in authentic communication and mutual cooperation. This vibrant model of engagement - not bound by history, theology, or politics - affirms that conflict is inevitable and yet not intractable. I believe in the power of personal relationships as a critical tool for withstanding international events and remaining committed to local results This resolution would take the beginning steps to start up a space for students to come together and talk. It could be in the form of an organization or just a set of events which would be launched bi-weekly or even just once a month. Diversity, equity and inclusion are undoubtedly core to the community we strive to build together here at UCSB. Prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion among our student leadership, senators, and students would create a foundation upon which we can all flourish together. ","My first priority will be helping UCSB students become as socially active as possible, because networking is a huge part of ""college experience."" COVID-19 has impacted everyone's social life, so I want to make sure that all UCSB students get to experience, live, and form a community of gauchos. I will organize several different online and COVID-friendly in-person events for students to get involved and have the best college experience. I want to make UCSB a safe place, where we do not have any stigma about mental health issues. I will have informational and interactive events related to mental health topics. I want ""less talking and more action"" to be the motto of UCSB. As a governing body, we need to stop assuming the needs and wants of students. I want to actually talk to students and hear from them about their wants and needs. This will be a step to change UCSB's environment into a safer yet free place for all the diverse communities. I want to start taking initiatives, even minor ones, to make UCSB campus green and eco-friendly. 
","I understand the need of working together with other AS members and entities to achieve our common goals. As an On-Campus Senator, I aim to increase campus participation and social activities while also improving the quality of life for on-campus students. I would collaborate closely with the Resident Halls Association to plan these activities and to assure the safety and involvement of students in the residence halls. I would also work with administration to promote wider outreach of options to students and to facilitate a seamless transition back to in-person college. Another key component of my platform is to improve communication and transparency between AS and the student body, as AS frequently seems distant and unavailable to the students they are intended to represent. I would collaborate with the Office of the Internal Vice President to promote greater openness to the student population, including increased student understanding of the inner workings of AS and more chances for students to participate in policy making. I feel that an efficient and discourse-filled AS is ideal for getting excellent legislation approved, and I believe that collaborating with the Internal Vice President would be a fantastic method to facilitate this. I shall not hesitate to use my position to express the views of the students I represent to the organizations with whom I will collaborate","I will make myself available by holding both in person and online meetings/office hours, allowing students to join whichever is more convenient for them. I will always use technology to make myself available to my constituents. I'll set up a Calendly link and set aside two hours every week to speak with my constituents personally; students will be able to schedule appointments at their leisure. Professor office hours, as many of us have discovered, are tremendously beneficial, and I believe senator office hours would be an excellent method to obtain a better grasp of the diverse student body's problems. The office hours, in my opinion, will be especially beneficial to clubs and groups seeking assistance from the Associated Students in organizing events, holding meetings, or spreading their ideas. Furthermore, I will use social media as another means of communication to keep in touch with my constituents. Of course, I'll always be approachable via email, but students will most likely communicate with me directly through Instagram. Students can leave direct comments on my accounts or send me a private message for a more meaningful conversation. ","Because of my experience with the Office of the President and several other organizations, I believe that I have the passion, credibility, and understanding of AS Senate and the position itself. I believe I can help UCSB grow and get better every single day. I recognize that I cannot claim to have experience from every group, but the advantage of working as a student for students is that I can actually listen to what they have to say about improving campus life. We can all agree that there is always work to be done, and I hope that I can offer a voice to everyone I represent so that they feel at home here no matter who they are. ",Left-leaning,Poor,"No,  I would vote ""no"". Because I refuse to regard one side of the dispute as completely evil and the other as completely helpless, and because I believe that being pro-Palestine without being anti-Israel is possible. Because, just as Palestinians have a legitimate claim to statehood, Israelis have a legitimate claim to peaceful coexistence. Because I feel that BDS will only make it more difficult to establish a two-state solution, I support rights for both peoples. 
","No, I think this idea is a bit extreme, and ultimately it doesn't matter what I want as it's up to the federal government how much they want to charge us for tuition. I do however think that we should double the pell grant and continue to lobby for more financial aid, as the tuition is barely affordable. I want to focus on more relevant issues like lowering student fees and advocating for student aid.","I have personally been able to benefit from the mental health services here at UCSB, but I have also noticed that it might be hard to reach a mental health professional if you are seeking help. When I first applied over the summer last year, it took only a month for me to get processed into the system and I was extremely satisfied with the psychologist to which I was assigned. Although these resources are available to all students, who knows how many students have never heard that they could seek help, or talk to someone if they need to? To better address this issue, I would work on spreading awareness on the benefits of CAPS, and suggest all students try to utilize it in some way. After more students take the necessary steps to try out some of the services CAPS offer, we can offer an anonymous survey to better analyze what UCSB is doing right and what we are doing wrong. This way we can work with CAPS, helping them and preventing them from stretching themselves too thin. ","No, I think the university could absolutely be doing more to handle these cases. The current approach is in no way sufficient or effective in dealing with sexual assault. I believe that if the university took a preventative rather than a reactive approach it would lead to a better future for our campus and its culture. These fraternities and sororities are simply able to brush it off whenever one of their members has allegations against them, and that is simply unacceptable.","Title IX and any university actions to address gender discrimination and/or sexual assault have my full support. The confidentiality of complaints and reporting is critical, and I fully endorse the university's firm stance against retribution for any complaints. However, I feel Title IX may be enhanced further; more restrictions should be implemented to guarantee that people do not use loopholes to commit sexual assault or discrimination. It is essential that critical rules, like Title IX, are implemented properly and consistently, and I will support measures that accomplish this. The institution must hold individuals accountable and never turn a blind eye to a sexual assault case. I also feel that we should improve mental health services for sexual assault survivors and ensure that they have swift access to appropriate mental health care. Finally, I would advocate for increased education on the issue of sexual assault. While the mandatory online sexual assault lesson is educational and essential, I feel there is more we can do, whether through AS events, social media campaigns, or university-run teaching. Through these regulations, both preventative principles and resource accessibility must be emphasized, and I will support measures that help spread knowledge and services. ","Definitely not. Although UCSB has done more than they have done historically, it's still not enough to properly serve these underrepresented groups. I believe that there is always more that can be done to assist marginalized groups that fear their voices are being ignored. The recent return to in-person instruction has revealed disparities across groups and has been a reminder that we still have a long way to go to effectively honor our principles of equality and justice. While I am happy with the number of initiatives and policies at UCSB committed to supporting marginalized populations, the pandemic has alienated many students from these programs. ","If elected to serve on the A.S. Senate, I would focus foremost on allocating funds to undersupported organizations on campus, specifically the Muslim Student Association. Just this we have been scrambling to fund the daily meals for students to break their fast, and considering the amount of money we have to throw around, no group should be left behind, or in this case, left hungry. This bill would ensure there are safe spaces for students to practice Ramadan on campus and modified hours at the dining hall. UCSB could better support Muslim students by understanding the importance of this month and how it is traditionally celebrated. The same goes for any and all religious and cultural holidays. In order for us to have a fully inclusive campus, we need to provide space and time for all students, regardless of their origin, as it seems we are discounting a good amount of our student population. ","Before my work in AS began, I assumed the average student like myself had no say in what went on in AS, but as it turns out most things revolve around the concerns of the student body. I'm sure many other students feel the same way, and our recent return to in-person instruction has only amplified the problems that have yet to be addressed. Because accessibility and openness are important components of my platform, I want to make the policymaking process clear and accessible to the student body. As a senator, I will regularly post on social media to inform students about the policies that are being discussed and the goals that I am presently striving to attain. I will also make an effort to hold forums where students may share their ideas, grievances, and opinions with me so that I can represent them in the Senate. My social media and inbox will always be accessible to those who wish to communicate any issues or questions, and I will make this very clear to students. Their feedback will be necessary to ensure I am accurately representing them, as my sole concerns don't overlap with all matters which concern our campus. ","Just this quarter, I have heard many students express their concerns about being in indoor spaces without wearing a mask. Here at UCSB, The recent lifting of the mask mandate has led to many more exposures to the virus within classes, and although cases haven't risen significantly, this is still bad for our campus. This affects the mental health of both students and faculty as well. The uncertainty of not knowing if they could be infected triggers stress and anxiety. Even with our vaccine mandate, the most sensible solution during this time of uncertainty is to focus on safe online learning options and intensify as well as upgrade the connected campus. ","I believe that the university could have done a lot better in giving students the option to continue their education from home if they preferred to do so. We keep bouncing around from remote learning to in-person learning, and I notice how it affects my studies and focus in classes. It's nice that there are still some asynchronous classes being offered, but the hybrid option should have been there since day one. Every student has a different viewpoint and different worries when it comes to the pandemic, but the university forced things onto them, creating unexpected problems with housing. This in turn led to a definite decrease in the wellbeing of students, which was totally uncalled for. The university did a poor job in making the choice to go in-person/online entirely up to each professor. This led to overflowing chaos and put a lot of pressure on professors. Students had little say in this decision and the quarter fell apart as a result. "
Zachary  Orsinelli ,sindhu,Off-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13140049/Zachary-Orsinelli-NishaMalley.jpg,,,Third year,Political Science,,,,"I am running for Off-Campus Senator because I want to make a change in the community of Isla Vista. After living in Isla Vista for two years, I have seen the school not do enough for the students in Isla Vista, and I want to push for improvements. For example, not all students feel safe in Isla Vista, and I want to do my part to change that. My goal has always been to leave a positive mark here at UCSB, and the A.S Senate can help towards that. Another reason is that I have always been interested in politics and holding a position in government. I worked for my local Congressman in high school, which gave me a lot of passion for politics early on. I decided to study political science in college and participate in student government here at UCSB as an Anacapa Hall representative. I love this college, and I want to dedicate myself to making it a better place for all students to live. Running for Off-Campus Senator is a great way to help the students at UCSB, improve the community of Isla Vista and explore my interest in politics. My goal is to graduate from Isla Vista and UCSB in better shape than when I left it.","I have previously been involved with leadership through on-campus housing as an Anacapa Hall Representative. I had weekly meetings where all representatives would plan various events for Anacapa Hall and pass policies to improve student living. My experience can transfer over to my Off-Campus Senator position because I learned what a community needs to prioritize to help students. I also worked as Kappa Sigma Sustainability Chair. I participated in many community service events, and I lived in Isla Vista for two years, getting to know a lot of the people here and their concerns. These experiences have given me leadership experience, insight into community needs, organizational/time management skills, and public speaking ability that all prepared me for the senator position. ","The three bills that I want to introduce are meant to increase the accessibility and safety in Isla Vista. As a senator, I want to introduce a bill around sexual assault. I want to create a mandatory, in-person course based entirely on sexual assault, consent, and all other topics 
that encapsulate the issue. The modules students must go through are not sufficient. Properly educating students on these issues is necessary to build a safer UCSB and Isla Vista. Another bill I would like to introduce is distributing free, easily accessible, and anonymous drug kits to the Isla Vista community. Overdoses are a severe problem in Isla Vista, and drug testing kits will reduce deaths and injuries from drug use. Student safety should be prioritized, and free drug testing kits save lives. Finally, I would like to propose a third bill to expand the campus food bank to Isla Vista. The food bank is an essential resource for many students in Isla Vista and many students living in Isla Vista find it inaccessible to them. Expanding the food bank to Isla Vista would incentivize more
students to use the Food Bank and significantly improve the quality of life of those who already use it. 
","My platform consists of Transparency/Accessibility, Sustainability, and Isla Vista Safety. For Transparency/ Accessibility, I want to make sure AS Senate’s actions are well documented and openly advertised through social media so students can always check on what changes we are making to campus and the surrounding 
community. A.S Senate must be more well known and easily accessible because students need to know what we are and what we are doing so they can give essential community feedback. For Sustainability, I want to work with our administration toward the goal of installing solar panels on school facilities in Isla Vista and adding additional hydration stations. The initiative would help UCSB and the surrounding community “Go Green.” Finally, for Isla Vista safety, I want to have free Ubers for students walking home at nighttime and add more CSOs that allow students to walk throughout Isla Vista safely. Student safety is essential, especially in light of recent events, and should not be overlooked. I will achieve these goals by working with organizations such as the Isla Vista Foot Patrol, AS administration, the Zero Waste Committee, TGIF (The Green Initiative Fund), and my fellow senators. I plan to introduce and vote for legislation that promotes my agenda of Transparency, Sustainability, and Isla Vista Safety. 
","To achieve the goals I outlined in my platform, there are multiple organizations that I plan to work with. For the increased CSOs, I plan to work closely with the IV Foot Patrol to push for a higher number of CSOs on duty during the night in Isla Vista. For the Uber Drivers, I plan to work with the AS Executive Board to allocate funding for students that do not feel safe walking home at night. To increase A.S’s Transparency and Accessibility, I plan to work with the A.S administration and the A.S social media page to increase the number of posts on A.S legislation and allocate a portion of the A.S budget to student outreach. Finally, for the sustainability goals I plan to work with TGIF, the A.S administration, and the IVCRC. Through the help of these organizations, my platform goals are reachable.","I will make myself available to my constituents through personal social media and the A.S Senate Social Media page. A big part of my campaign is accessibility and transparency; I want to post about all changes we are making to the Isla Vista community through Instagram, leaving our comments and DMs open to community feedback. I will push for a Senate that the community can easily understand and follow their plans of action and how they plan to fulfill them. Suppose anyone has specific questions on potential policy, feedback on passed legislation, questions on how A.S works, and more. In that case, I plan to respond to them quickly and work together to change Isla Vista for the better. My personal Instagram is also open. I am available to those genuinely interested in meeting with them on Zoom or Facetime to discuss policy and how A.S Senate plans to improve Isla Vista. In an in-person capacity, I plan to advocate for more in-person office hours where UCSB students can talk about A.S Senate, their goals, and what each senator is personally contributing. Also, I think the A.S Senate should implement town hall meetings where students can voice their concerns to student governments. Overall, I will make myself available in both remote and in-person capacities to the best of my abilities. ","I am the best candidate for Off-Campus Senator because I have the necessary qualifications for the position and the drive to improve UCSB and the surrounding community. I have lived-in Isla Vista for two years, so I understand the community’s wants and needs. I can represent the people of Isla Vista and improve the community. I will make sure all voices are heard in the community and have a say in the changes A.S Senate makes to UCSB and Isla Vista. Second, I have a hard work ethic that I have improved on throughout my time in college and a passion for politics and UCSB as a whole. I have previous experience in political leadership roles, including UCSB student leadership. These experiences have prepared me for the critical position of Senator. I have excellent time management skills which are necessary for a senator to do their job effectively. Most importantly, I believe I can improve this community and will work hard to achieve the goals I have set out. When I start something I like to finish it and if I become your next Off-Campus Senator, I will not be satisfied until I achieve the platform I set out. ",Left-leaning,"Good, Last Year’s A.S Senate did a good job with their resources and the situation they were given when they took office. Transitioning out of co-vid was a difficult circumstance to be placed in; however, they could have improved in multiple areas. For example, they did not allow enough community feedback and reach out to the student body. They have not been a significant enough entity on campus to the point where a majority of the students do not know what A.S does and that is something that we could improve on. 
","No, I would not vote in favor of BDS actions against Israel. I think that the sanctions would promote harm to the citizens of Israel rather than the government that holds the responsibility. In addition, BDS has caused hatred and antisemitism towards the Jewish community on campus. The Palestinian people need to be helped; however, I think that divestment and the BDS movement are not the right way to do it. 
","Yes, UCSB should be tuition-free because high-level education should not be disbarred from those not able to afford it. Education is a right; everyone is entitled to a good education. I think that tuition-free schooling would help members of disadvantaged communities and help decrease the wealth gap. However, as an Off-Campus Senator, it is not within my power to make UCSB tuition-free. ","I do not believe that mental health services at UCSB are adequate. While UCSB does have resources for people struggling with mental health issues these services are understaffed and do not have the funding to handle the amount of students here at UCSB. There are month-long waiting lists for appointments, the services when appointments are given are inadequate. Mental health issues need to be taken seriously and students should not have to wait months to receive treatment. University life breeds mental health issues with the stress it puts on students and UCSB should take responsibility for the mental stress they put on students. The university should allocate more funding to CAPS, CARE, and other organizations that were made to help students with their mental health. As an A.S Off Campus Senator, I will use my jurisdiction to push the administration to allocate more funding to these vital organizations so students can get proper mental health care that offers good counseling and quick appointments. 
","The school has done poorly to address these concerns—however, not just the administration but also the administrative bodies that govern these organizations. IFC and Panhellenic need to have clear rules and consequences for these above-listed actions. They need to be more proactive rather than reactive. I plan to help make sure that voices for sexual assault are heard and that UCSB fraternities and sororities are appropriately held accountable for their actions. A proactive method to assist school-affiliated organizations to be held responsible is to have better IFC check-ins on fraternity and sorority life to ensure the organizations are within the rules for coronavirus and hazing protocols. As for sexual assault, I advocate for
newly initiated fraternities and sororities’ members to go through an in-depth sexual assault and consent class for members to be educated on the topic. Also, it should be be a top priority of IFC and Panhellenic to watch out for the the suspicious behavior of fraternity and sorority members during walkarounds. If allegations are brought up, they should be taken seriously, and the organization responsible should be punished heavily. As of right now, the school has not done enough, and I plan to advocate for change in this area with my position as Off-Campus Senator. ","I am familar with the university’s Title IX office and its function to maintain an academic environment free of sex discrimnation, sexual harrassment and sexual violence. I think that the university can do more to support sexual assault survivors by giving funding to understaffed services on campus such as CAPS, CARE, SASA, and other organzations that help sexual assault survivors heal. These organizations are important in helping survivors and with a lack of funding, they cannot do their intended job properly. I also believe that these organizations are not advertised well enough to the students of UCSB so that survivors have an obvious safe place to go where they can heal. I think a bigger issue is UCSB turning a blind eye to allegations in the past. The lack of consideration given to allegations in the past makes victims of sexual assault less likely to report sexual assault in the future because they may feel it will not be taken seriously. UCSB needs to improve their responses to sexual assault allegations and properly take them into consideration and investigate. Sexual assault of any nature should not be condoned by this university and survivors of sexual assault should be given proper resources to heal. The university has not done either of these adequately and must improve in these areas immediately. ","UCSB is NOT effectively serving historically underrepresented groups, and there is a lot the administration could improve on. Whether it be mental support, academic support, or cultural support, the university should strengthen these things for these underrepresented students to thrive in college. However, I recognize I am not a member of most of these underrepresented groups. As a senator, I would work in uplifting these voices that are typically underrepresented and work to provide a platform to speak about concerns they may have. I want to ensure that all student voices are heard in the A.S Senate, especially those that are historically underrepresented groups. UCSB also fails to admit as many students from underrepresented groups into UCSB, which does not allow for the diversity and the various
cultures UCSB claims to promote. The university should include a more fair admissions process as well as more academic resources for underrepresented communities to promote a more diverse academic environment at UCSB. For admissions For example, the university could allocate more money to the American American and Asian American studies departments. The university should also promote clubs such as the Queer and Trans Community, Black Student Union, and many other clubs for underepresented groups. ","The first bill I plan to offer is through my sustainability platform, where I want to add hydration stations to Isla Vista. These water bottle filling stations promote reusable flasks/bottles, instead of plastic water bottles and make it easier for students to remain hydrated with clean drinking water especially during the hotter months in the year. Bringing hydration stations to Isla Vista would help the community and environment significantly. The bill will allocate funding to build 20 hydration stations across Isla Vista so students have access to clean water. The hydration stations will improve the happiness, sustainability, and health of the community of Isla Vista. It is a bill that I would love to author and promote. ","I agree that the A.S Senate is not accessible to the average student. I want to change that. I would start a change on social media. I want to push for constant Instagram and Facebook updates on legislation that A.S has recently passed and plans to pass. I would also advocate for the direct message channels to be open for community feedback and the comment section. A.S Senate should have someone to respond to the community in a timely and orderly manner. Another step I would take as Off-Campus Senator is to advocate for an update to the A.S Senate website. I think that if a student has an interest in the A.S Senate website, they should be able to find it within a minute. Our website is not up to that par yet, and I want to update and simplify the website to make it more accessible to our students. Students are who the A.S Senate is supposed to have in mind FIRST when we are making changes that affect Campus and Isla Vista. We must always keep our community informed and
updated on what the Senate wants to do for students, the UCSB campus, and Isla Vista. ","If I get elected, I want to make sure that the university remains flexible on its stance on lifting the mask mandate. If we receive another high spike in co-vid cases or a new deadly/viral variant comes around, I will advocate for a return to masks in classes until it is safe for students. However, I think we should try our best to keep classes in person because I believe that students receive a higher quality of education and have easier access to the school’s various resources when school is in person. To provide the highest quality education while protecting the health of its student body, the Senate and the University at large should focus on co-vid cases in Isla Vista to understand whether to implement masks. Student Health should be immensely important to A.S Senate and UCSB, so we must take matters that seriously put student health at risk. CDC guidelines should be followed and proper precautions need to be made to protect the health of UCSB students and residents of Isla Vista.","I believe that the University succeeded in handling certain aspects of the pandemic and remote instruction, but could have significantly improved its approach. UCSB succeeded in handling student health by responding early in the pandemic. UCSB was quick to announce online learning during the initial pandemic prioritizing students' health over keeping classes in person. However, the university failed to handle the mental health aspect of the transition to online learning by not offering proper resources for the mental health toll the pandemic would inflict on students. CARE and CAPS should have been heavily funded and widely advertised for students that were expressing mental health concerns. Also remote instruction was not engaging students enough and teachers were not educated properly on how to transition from teaching an in person course to a remote one. I think that student participation and motivation were lacking due to the circumstances and the professors were not prepared for how to educate people online through a screen. Combined with this, deadlines should have been more flexible as students were dealing with so much during the pandemic including family and mental health problems. There should have been a campus wide policy for flexible deadlines and while certain teachers were understanding, others were not and the students paid for it. Overall, the University had successes
and failures in its handling of the pandemic, physical health was acknowledged, but mental health was not."
Nathan Lee,atmika,University Owned Off-Campus Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13122009/220408-NathanLee3-KaylaLi.jpg,,he/him,second-year,Economics and History double-major,,,,"I’m running for the A.S Senate for the University Apartment because I’m passionate about
serving my constituents, the wonderful people in the University apartments, and the university at
large. During the pandemic and my first year of university, many kind and generous people at
UCSB, both faculty and students, helped and mentored me throughout the entire remote learning
year. So I felt the duty to serve the students at UCSB to help more people adjust to campus life. I
got involved in the Resident Hall Association as a Hall Council president to serve students in the
residence hall and it has inspired me to serve students as an A.S Senator further. As a Chinese
American, I became more aware of the lack of effort to include international and transferred
students, the majority of the UCSB Apartment population. My goal is to make UCSB not only a
better place for learning but also a better place where everyone can feel included in the UCSB
community and can find compassion and respect. I’m inspired by the accomplishment done by
the previous and current A.S, and I’m confident that I can build on their success and make UCSB
an even better place.","I am currently serving as the President of the San Rafael Hall as well as holding a series of leadership positions in student organizations such as the vice-chairman of the UCSB chapter of Young American for Freedom and an officer at the Thomistic Institute. My experience serving the residents at San Rafael has given me insight into how university events are run and operated and also how to run events myself which will allow me to adequately propose and support the university and club-run events both as a legislator and a club liaison. I believe my experience in RHA has especially prepared me to help students in university-owned apartments since I will have come in with knowledge of how UCSB housing functions and provide more targeted help. As a member of the leadership board at the Thomistic Institute, I helped host multiple events on and off campus with over 100 students attending which instilled in me successful organizational t skills. I also founded the Chapter of Young Americans for Freedom at UCSB, where I learned not only leadership, communication, and how to organize students who agree with my ideas and, but also how to persuade and disagree with civility. I will take these skills with me into the senate as I collaborate with others, learn from those who have different views than me, and work to be efficient for the students we serve.","The first bill that I would like to pass is a bill to allocate 10000 dollars every year to create one award each for faculty in Science and Math, Humanities, Social science, and Engineering, to recognize their effort to accommodate student’s learning needs. The candidates will be nominated by students and evaluated by the senate with a number of factors including but not limited to: Teaching skills, textbook Affordability, Grading fairness, accessibility of recorded lectures and other auxiliary learning tools. This award is designed to encourage all faculty from all fields to move UCSB instruction into the post covid era, with compassion and responsiveness towards the need and curiosity of the students, without sacrificing academic integrity. I would also like to propose a bill increasing the amount of funding going towards start-up student organizations from 250 dollars to 350 and eliminate the requirement to be registered for two academic years. Many student clubs often cannot survive without the help from A.S, and our current system often ends only funding already popular clubs and hobbies, and organizations
started by wealthy students. All passion of UCSB students should be supported. Another resolution I would propose is a positional resolution to formally condemn the Santa Barbara Sheriffs for his lack of care to protect the residents in Isla Vista. I’ve spoken to university-owned Apartment residents who are afraid to bike back to their apartment late due to the fear of assault. The inaction of the sheriff cannot stand.","My platform is centered around the acronym CARE: Career, Academics, Respect, and
Extracurriculars. I will work hard in all those four areas of UCSB to make sure every student can have a more rewarding UCSB experience. A career is what most of us seek after university, and I think more effort should be made at UCSB to help all students, not just the high achievers, to find a job or an internship during or after university. I plan on working with both the local businesses and Non-profits around the Santa Barbara area to make job opportunities more accessible to average UCSB students so everyone can find a job or internship that they are passionate about! I’m also dedicated to making UCSB’s academic excellence reflect the signs of
our time. I plan on closely work with the academic senate during this and the next academic school year to make sure pandemic academic policy that can benefit students, late drops, online exams, and lecture recordings, can remain the official university policy to better accommodate the ever-changing student body after the Pandemic. I’m also advocating for Respect from the University administration for all students, but especially to religious and ethnic minorities. I will work with ethnic and religious minority communities at UCSB to serve their need. I will also propose an increase in
funding for RCOs to make sure the hobbies of Gauchos are supported.","I hope to work closely with the Academic Senate to advance my plans for academic reform, especially on late drops and expanded unit allowance for passes 1 and 2. I will also work with the Office of Student Life and the Resident Hall Association to advertise my new proposed award for the faculty to all students so students can help the senate to discover faculty that teach with compassion, care and fairness. I will also work with academic departments within the University to make their hiring process more transparent so all students can have the ability to find an internship or work that they are passionate about. I will also work with SEAL and other RCOs to try my best to help Gauchos to advance their hobbies.","A large part of my platform is centered on respect for all students. And part of my commitment to honor that platform is to make myself available to students in all capacity that I’m capable of.
I will offer both in-person and remote office hour. But starting next year. I will schedule extra office hour for international and transfer students that requires special attention. I will also try to host a monthly dinner in a uni-owned apartment for all residents of the Uni-Owned Apartment to meet their senator, hang out, have a good meal, and voice their concern to me. I will also increase my social media presence on Instagram to achieve greater transparency","I believe I’m the best candidate to represent the Off-Campus Apartment community because I believe the skill set that I possess can serve the community well- but especially the transfer and the international community which makes up the
majority of the off-campus apartment population. I have experience serving as an employee for the housing service which gives me insights into how the housing administration operates which will give me an advantage in effectively solving my constituents’ concerns. I’m also fluent in both Mandarin and Cantonese which will be helpful for me to communicate to international students from China which is where most international students came from. I also think that I can be a strong
resource for transfer students given my experience of transitioning from remote off-campus learning to on-campus learning. During my first year in person at UCSB, I learned how to find a sense of belonging at UCSB and meet friends quickly. I hope to share my experiences and lessons with the new incoming transfer students at Uni-Owned Apartments to ensure a smooth transition.",right-wing,"Good I think the 73 student senate did a good job in terms of handling the challenge of transitioning from remote to in-person instruction and responding to the Monger Hall situation through immediate resolution and supporting the A.S to do their job. However, I think more can be done in terms of protecting student safety in IV and general support for RCOs.","No, I personally do not support divestment as I believe that divestment is a blanket solution to an
incredibly nuanced problem with no clear solutions. I also future believe being elected to the
A.S senate will not give me any power to influence international politics and the question is quite unhelpful for the purpose of representing students. However, I’m ultimately representing the students in the university apartment and my vote will reflect their opinion.","No, I believe that the cost of higher education should be determined by the student’s
socioeconomic status rather than a blanket solution of tuition-free. Americans who have a
college degree earn more than Americans who don’t. I have a hard time getting my head
around the idea a majority who earn less because they didn’t go to college subsidize a
minority who will earn more because they do.","I do not believe that the mental health services at UCSB are adequate. I think more
can be done in terms of offering better service and running better advertisements.
Many students I’ve spoken to either don’t know mental health resources exist or how
to access them. I have a personal soft spot for students dealing with mental health
issues as someone who personally fighting long-term anxiety and eating disorders. I
personally have a hard time receiving the care that I need either from CAPs or private
mental health providers in IV. Although therapy is mostly destigmatized at UCSB, I
personally still believe more people can benefit from talking to a therapist. I will work
with CAPS and health and wellness to increase investment in therapy for students who are not diagnosed with any mental health issues to proactively prevent them rather than treat them. I will also work with religious leaders in IV to reach out to religious students about spiritual counseling and invest in religious communities. I will also work with Student health and local providers to hire more mental health professionals to serve UCSB students and the IV community and strengthen our mental health infrastructure so people who are troubled by mental health problems can receive the help that they need.","Although not currently involved in Greek life, my past experience in Greek life allowed me understand the genuine bond that Greek life builds between students and the value in our community. However, it doesn’t mean Greek life doesn’t have its problems. Many disruptive parties, hazing, and sexual assaults have been traced back to being affiliated with Greek life and there have been few consequences. I personally know that my religious community and the local Jewish Synagogue have been struggling with worshipping in peace with a Fraternity house being our neighbor. I would like to see enforcement of existing rules carrying out against sexual
assault, and hazing I would like to see stricter rules carrying harsher fines for noise violations be instituted by the University administration. However, it is my firm belief that no student or Greek
life chapter should be closed by the university for the action of one individual member or one offense. Greek lives are integral institutions of the American education system and should be protected. Such action should only be entertained with repeat offenses.","Although not a legal scholar in any capacity, I understand title IX’s integral role in upholding gender equality and protection for sexual assault survivors. Sexual Assault and gender discrimination violate all sense of moral decency and should not be tolerated at UCSB. I think it is a good and necessary policy to make sure that every person on campus can be treated with compassion and dignity, and provides equal protection of the law for people of all gender Other than the obvious steps needed to be taken to educate students about sexual assault, more is needed to be done to help sexual assault survivors to get the help and justice they deserve. That is why I support an increase in investment in organizations like CARE that can lead sexual assault survivors to the resource they need. I also support increasing investment in the Legal Resource center to hire new lawyers specializing in sexual assault litigation so sexual assault victims can pursue justice under the law if they desire. I also hope to work with SASA (Students Against Sexual Assault) and the office of the EVPSA to listen to survivors and respond to their needs, both on a personal and a political level to further the interpretation of the wordings of title
IX.","I definitely do not think UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups. As an Asian American, it is frustrating to see Asian Americans and other minority groups being sidelined or even ignored by conversations surrounding historically underrepresented groups and inclusion on campus. It is almost like we don’t exist or have our unique experiences and struggle to live in America. I think the senate can always do better to include all students who feel alienated by the mainstream campus culture. During my time in the Senate, I will work with all historically underrepresented groups on campus and learn about their need. I will especially try to highlight and empower communities that the mainstream culture likes to ignore like Asian, international, transfer, and Muslim students on campus, and bring them to the forefront when inclusion-related topics take place in the senate while empowering the rest as well.","The first Bill or resolution I will propose is to pass a positional resolution objecting to the decision of the academic senate made during the fall quarter to reduce the registration load for students during the first and second pass and instead propose to add each student’s registration limit by two units, making it 14 in pass 1 and 17 in pass two. I’ve heard many students, especially in STEM and the social sciences, telling me that they are having trouble securing classes they need each quarter and therefore have to delay their graduation plan, therefore taking on more tuition and debt. I think this is a policy that has to be reversed and the resolution from the A.S senate is the first step to reverse the awful decision by the academic senate. I will then closely work with them to ensure the unit count for pass 1 and 2, as well as other policies like late drop and late pass/ no pass policy, are preserved and institutionalized. Covid changed all of us, including how we learn, so it is only right for the university to adapt to the need of the student body and the signs of the time.",,,
Billy Wu,nisha,International Senator,Independent,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13122554/220408-BillyWu3-KaylaLi.jpg,,he/him,first-year,Political Science,,,,"For far too long, international students have been neglected by the school and its important decision-making. Many of our unique struggles, including but not limited to COVID-related return-to-campus policies, inaccessible campus resources, and community security, were not aptly addressed by the AS Senate. 
I am keenly aware of the struggles and loneliness many international students, including myself, experienced when we first arrived. Our languages and cultural differences made it hard for us to access vital resources. We are one of the most underrepresented groups at UCSB. ","I have worked tirelessly to better the situation of International Students. In the past year, I have served as the Federal Policy Analyst under the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs in AS and as an officer in one of the largest international student organizations on campus. I have personally advocated on behalf of students of all ethnicities from many different countries of origin in community safety, reasonable return-to-campus policies, and successfully lobbied for 22.5 million dollars in funding from the California State Government for minority students groups. ","1. I plan to push for more reasonable, flexible, and lenient return-to-campus policies for international students traveling home under COVID-19 restrictions placed by their governments. This will reduce the influx of students on the first day of school, preventing a potential outbreak. 
2. In support of international student survivors, I will push for all major international student organizations to establish a peer program in conjunction with psychological services provided by campus resource centers such as CARE. This means I will push all campus resources to include more language services in partnership with all major international student organizations, ensuring that all international students have adequate access to vital services. 
3. I will push for further partnerships connecting various international student organizations with AS by establishing AS accounts on international students' social media platforms,
such as LINE, Whatsapp, Wechat, Weibo, and Red. (this is not a final list as more will be included) This will give more exposure to all the university's resources to offer to all international students. ","My platforms are: REPRESENT the voices of all international students in the Senate and push for further partnerships connecting various international student organizations with A.S. entities and allocating more funds to international student organizations to combat expansive tuition and housing costs. 
ADVOCATE for more reasonable, flexible, and lenient return-to-campus policies for all international students traveling home under COVID restrictions placed by their governments. 
FIGHT for a safer campus and Isla Vista by expanding the Safe Transportation Task Force to include more international students and work with various international student organizations in promoting safety and legal education. 
ENSURE all major campus resource centers such as CARE, CAPS, Career Service, RCSGD (Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity)… to include more services catered towards international students with more languages and international students staff available. 
Building a solid relationship between AS and all major international student organizations by spreading AS and other school resources on social media platforms that international students use and connecting vital campus resources to international students will be a key to achieving my goals. ","I hope to work with all major international student organizations such as the ISA, CSSA, Indus, KSA, JSA, TSA, HKSA, VSA…etc. I also hope to connect all international organizations with AS entities such as the GGC, EVPLA, 
EVPSA…etc. Finally, I hope to collaborate with all major school resource centers such as CARE, CAPS, Career Service, RCSGD…etc.","Serving the student body of UCSB will be my top priority. I will set up flexible office hours as well as establish social media accounts on all major social media platforms, especially ones that international students frequently visit, to make myself easily accessible to all students in need. You can also find me in the Art & Architecture room on the first floor of the library trying to catch my deadlines. ","I am an international student. I am keenly aware of all the challenges international students like us face. I have the experience, but I also have the skills to advocate for us. I have served in both the AS and one of the most prominent international student organizations on campus. In both cases, I have dedicated myself to advocating for students in all corners of UCSB and in front of the California State Government. In the past two years, I have also worked for two law firms, one in the US and one in China, giving me the skills to analyze and author documents such as bills and resolutions critically. ",Centrist,Poor; The two International Senators have done virtually nothing to improve the conditions of international students. They fulfilled none of the promises made during last year’s election. Campus resources are still not being utilized by international students. We still have to struggle to cope with an unreasonable return-to-campus policy when hundreds of international students have to quarantine for weeks when traveling home.,Yes; I do not support any companies that profit from human rights abuse.,Yes; I believe the right to an education is a fundamental human right.,"Mental health services have not done nearly enough to address issues faced by international students for years. There is no adequate exposure to international students. There are no sufficient services connecting international students to such services in their respective languages. We need to provide more accessible services to all international students, overcoming existing language and cultural barriers.","Sexual assaults have no place on our campus. Loving and protecting each other should be the fundamental principle of all Gauchos. I vehemently condemn any acts of sexual assault conducted by any individual regardless of greek-life affiliations. The novel coronavirus has killed millions of innocent lives across the globe. The majority of the international student population is still under strict COVID restrictions placed by the government, making our travel home difficult and unpredictable. I believe that no Gauchos wish to harm their innocent classmates deliberately. ","Ensuring a work and academic environment free of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence is the goal of UCSB’s Title IX office. It is also my goal and core belief of myself. International students are especially vulnerable to sexual assaults. I will push for all major international student organizations to establish a peer program with psychological services provided by campus resource centers such as CARE. UCSB’s CARE has a page that addresses “interpersonal violence for international students,” noting that international students “may feel confused about the US legal system, UCSB processes and options, and your rights as a survivor.” I will also push for a general education program for international students to learn about their rights and options when encountering such problems. As many international students face language barriers and cultural differences, they may not choose to seek help when such instances happen; therefore, it should be my priority and the priority of the school to help and educate international students against sexual violence. ","In the past year serving the EVPSA, I, along with my dedicated coworkers, have lobbied for the state for $22.5 Million for outreach and retention programs for students of color, QT* students, and those of marginalized identities, secured legislative champions to reform financial aid both 
federally and at the state level through a $400 expansion of the Pell Grant and the modernization of the Cal Grant to emphasize equity, and fought on behalf of Undocumented students and their access to fellowships and additional financial aid support. We also pursued a $5 Million budget ask to support Undocumented Student Programs (USPs) across the UC. We have also mobilized to support redistricting efforts to ensure that wealthy homeowners would not dilute SB county's student vote and voice. There is still more work to be done for all underrepresented groups, and the work will always continue when I am elected. ","I will push for more reasonable, flexible, and lenient return-to-campus policies for international students traveling home under COVID-19 restrictions placed by their governments. I plan to stagger the return time of students, allowing those who wish to return to campus to do so as soon as possible—but giving the flexibility to those who wish to return at a later time as the second wave. Finally, the third wave will be international students restricted by their governments’ covid policies. I will push to reduce the influx of students on the first day of school, preventing a potential outbreak. ","If AS is typically seen as inaccessible to the average student, it is seen as a completely new vocabulary to international students. Many of us are not even aware of the existence of AS. We need to establish AS social media accounts on social media platforms that international students use and set up liaisons at major international student organizations to educate students in their first languages about the function of AS and how they can represent themselves.","Preserving student health should still be the priority of the Senate and the university regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing students with vaccination opportunities, ramping up testing capabilities, and preparing self-test kits should be on the school's agenda. The Senate should do its best to support such efforts. We should also give students sufficient flexibility in choosing their preferred way of learning. At the end of the day, the well-being of our students should be on the top of the list, not the profitability of the school. ","The university has virtually done nothing in terms of providing international students with adequate physical and mental health support. We, international students, do not have accessible means that connect ourselves with the school’s resources. We have to address this gap between international students and resource centers at once by promoting AS and other services on social media platforms that international students use, setting up liaisons at international student organizations to raise awareness of such services, allowing more international students to work at such resource centers and expanding their services in different languages."

The first few days to me is just like a any other tour to a foreign country, the exploration of  unknown things and culture always excited me. However, when I moved into my dorm in Manzi  and meet my roommates, things are just different. Both of them are wonderful human beings and  a great pleasure to be roommate with, however, when I see their parents fly with them to UCSB  and walked with them to the dorm and helped them put the quilt of mattress on, that feeling  suddenly strikes me. The feeling of you is all by yourself in a foreign land is quiet frankly, not  easy to deal with. Fortunately, I met some great friends who helped me find the sense of  belongness in here. Yet not all international students come from China like I did, meaning it will  be much difficult for them to find people from same culture background. The reason I am  running for senate is I want to be able to help the new coming international students walk an  easier road than I did.  ","I like talk with people, especially with those who I don’t know before. Each of us got to  UCSB for a reason. Though the reasons vary from one to another, we all have something to add  to the community of UCSB. But what makes me sad is a lot of international students, especially  among my culture background, can’t really engaged in UCSB due to language, information and  
culture barriers. As a Chinese, when I approach other Chinese international students in mandarin,  contrary to the stereotype, our life is so much more than having a straight A transcript or  shopping at luxury stores. Just a few days ago, when I chatted with a guy I met in the lounge, he  turns out to be a car enthusiast and offered me a lot of solid advice on which used cars I should  consider. Back to the question, what have I been involved in UCSB that prepared me to be a  senator? I listen. I chat with people that have all sorts of opinions and listen to what they have to  say. Someone times I agree with them and sometimes I don’t and we get into a friendly  argument. But through all these listening, I can say with confident that I have a good gauge of  what international students community in UCSB are concerned about.  ","I have three bills in mind at the moment.  
1. Bring AS account to social medias that international students are familiar with.  
At the moment, there are a wide array AS accounts on Facebook, Instagram and  Twitter, or in a simpler term, the US social medias. I would propose to set up an  official AS account on WeChat and another one on Line. These accounts will  aggregate and pick important information posted on AS’s US social media accounts  and bring them to social medias international students more familiar with. 
2. Set up an international students peer program.  
As discussed in question 1, a large reason I am running for office is the loneliness I  felt when been on a foreign land for the first time. The peer program will pair  continuing international students with incoming ones for a weekly half an hour  meeting for the first quarter they come to UCSB. I believe the shared experiences of  international students will greatly helped the academic, culture and language  transition process. The continuing international students will receive an  
200$ compensation for their service by AS.  
3. Advocate with the school to set up an international students house.  
In manzanita village, currently my home, we have a wide range of living learning  communities (LLC), ranging from women in STEM to college of creative study and  to latinx and black students. The experience and struggles of international students  definitely worth of a house of us. A house with predominantly international students  will make us more readily find peers who are going through similar transition  process.  ","As you can see in the bills I am going to propose, I have one platform and one platform only,  which is doing everything with in my power to promote the rights of international students. In  terms of how I will achieve them, it is quite simple. I have found a range of issues that can be  resolved by the power of AS senate. An candidate running for the same position last year  proposed to make grants and scholarship that reserved to US students accessible to international  students also. That goal, if succussed, would of course be wonderful. But let’s be realistic for a  second here, there grants were provided by US government, i.e, the taxpayer of US and are  restricted to US citizens by law. Even an actual senator would facing a huge challenge to change  them, let alone an AS senator. My agendas are different. They are PRACTICAL.  ","International students come from a wide range of countries and culture backgrounds. As  such, to serve all of us will require the inputs of all of us. I will work closely with  ISA(International Students Association), CSSA(Chinese Students and Scholars Association)  and TSA(Taiwanese Students Association) to gather as much of opinions and help as I can. An  example of that would be the set up of AS official account on Line. I am pretty familiar with  WeChat public account but not so much on Line. For this part, I will need the help of Taiwanese  friends. ","Thanks to the development on technologies. Now our options are not limited to mail and  face-to-face conversations. I will make my email public to all students and set up weekly drop in zoom chatting hours where every international student can freely join. Also, if the issue is  private or complicated, I have a bike. So I’m also open to in-person conversation in a time and  place that is convenient for us.  ","I am a practical idealist. As a Chinese, come to US to study politics definitely require a level  of idealism. However, politics is a subject about practicality. Of course we want to do the right  thing, but we’ll carefully choose what are the right things that are within our ability, i,e, I won’t  run on a platform that require change the law.  
Also, I served as my high school’s associated students body’s president on my senior year,  which offered me some unique perspective of being an senate.  ","Other: Social democrat, like the practice in Scandinavian countries.  
","Fair; They came up with some good programs, but as a  international student I find them are not that easily to access for us. ","Yes;  “no one is an island, entire of itself.” Of course, I want the  AS do the right thing. However, before I vote in favor of the resolution, I’ll first need to go  through the impact of such move as I have a duty to make sure our AS fees are spending  effectively.  
","No; Making UCSB tuition-free means it will get all its funding from  government, more specific, from a set of bureaucrats. This will impeding with the freedom of  research.  
","As someone who are currently taking CAPS services, I’ll say the quality is splendid. However,  the wait time is just too long. I raise the exposure of other mental health services like social  workers here at UCSB to provided some alternative to CAPS.  ","There need to be a clear line drawn between individual misconduct and a toxic culture. If  a organization here promote a toxic culture, they should no longer be accredited by UCSB,  period.  ","In my view, we should do more to raise their exposure among international students.  ","As an Asian student myself, I can say with confident that in every encounters I had here  in UCSB I were treated with any other. So a pretty solid job I’ll say.  ",The bill to set up AS account on WeChat and Line. As international students also have a  right to hear AS programs in an social media they are familiar with.  ,"Instead of letting students approaching me, I’ll approaching students. I like chatting,  especially with those I don’t know before. Through this, I’ll be able to hear their concerns and  offer my help if needed.  ","Personally, I believe in-person is by far the most productive teaching method mankind  has even invented. However, I don’t believe school’s choice of forcing everyone to be in  person in such a turbulence time is a good call. The university should provide online options to  students prefer remote instructions, especially to the large entry Gen-Chem and Econ series.  ","The decisions school took were most reasonable and correct. However, they have done a  terrible job at communicate with students. Why does Chancellor Yang have to sent out the email  extend online instruction from January 16th to the end of January on a Saturday afternoon at  January 15th . This is just not reasonable."
Jay Schmidt,nisha,Transfer Senator,Storke Party,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/13132104/220408-JaySchmidt-JoshuaYepezMartinez.jpeg,,,third-year,Political Science,,,,"As a political science major, I have always been interested in how politics work. While I have read up on and taken classes surrounding political participation, I have never been able to get hands-on experience in how political organizations are genuinely run. This is why I have decided to run for the 73rd Senate since I would love to get some hands-on experience with how political bodies operate. I also have a passion for improvement within my community and have always enjoyed being able to help improve the area I live in. In the past, I have always tried to volunteer at organizations that would help those who needed it, and I believe now that the best way to help the students here at UCSB is through involvement in the 73rd AS Senate. Seeing the growth of UCSB and knowing that I was a part of that change for the better has always been an inspiration to me. I would love to give back to the students here at UCSB, and I hope that through AS Senate, I will be able to use my knowledge and passion to help represent and improve all students and communities here.","During my time at UCSB, I have devoted myself to getting involved in clubs and organizations that I possibly can. Each of my experiences within these organizations has taught me valuable life skills that have made me qualified to be an AS senator and represent the student population equally here at UCSB. Involvement in campus and Isla Vista organizations include being a member of Greek life, enrollment in the UCSB honors program, participation in the honors programs community service events, involvement in UCSB transfer center events and programs, and frequent social interactions with other fellow students living in Isla Vista. My involvement with these organizations and people has taught me valuable leadership, organizational and communicational skills that have made me qualified to become an AS senator. While I greatly value the skills I have learned here at UCSB, the most significant thing involvement has taught me is that UCSB and Isla Vista is a very diverse community with students coming from all backgrounds. Being a part of organizations has taught me more about students who share different experiences and face other challenges than me and has prepared me to help better represent the diverse UCSB community. ","If elected into office, three bills and resolutions I plan on implementing follow through with my idea of more housing contracts and safer travel accommodations. The first resolution would support more safe housing options through local hotel contracts. Despite the recent proposal of Munger hall, this cannot be the only realistic option for improving housing as Munger Hall itself does not seem to be a viable living space for students. This resolution would allow for the renewal and further creation of hotel contracts for UCSB students to live in. Secondly, I plan on pushing for a bill that will allocate money to CSO and SASA. With the alarming events that have occurred on and around campus, now is the time to advocate and support survivors of sexual assault and to try to limit occurrences at UCSB. By allocating money to CSO and SASA, safer travel accommodations will become available to students. The final bill I propose would increase funding and expand the role of IVTU here on campus. This would allow for better opportunities to create new housing leases available to the students here at UCSB.","My campaign platform comprises three issues I believe most affect the transfer and overall student population. These three platforms are increasing advertisement of student and school-run organizations and outlets, pushing for increased hotel contracts to secure available housing for all UCSB students, and pushing for safer travel accommodations for the student body. Increased advertisement of these organizations will help transfer and current students find available resources and outlets to help them on their educational path. While there are public organizations, clubs, and other groups available to help students out on campus, knowledge about these groups can be hard to come by, especially if you are a new transfer student. With the high number of new students attending UCSB, housing can be challenging for transfer and current students alike. That is why I plan to continue the work already made by AS Senate and push for further hotel contracts to allow all student housing accommodations. Finally, increased safe travel accommodations through organizations such as CSO will help students feel safe and welcome at UCSB. ","In order to achieve my platform goals, there are several organizations I plan on working with. For increased advertisement, I plan on working closely with AS Executive board to help start a project to implement automated billboards to help promote advertising and reduce waste. To secure more housing options, I plan on working with IVTU Executive members and local residential services to see if the negotiation of hotel contracts can be extended and expanded. To promote safer travel accommodations, I plan to work with local transportation services executive members to secure reasonable and convenient travel methods for students. I also plan on working with the Isla Vista community affairs board to address the issue and try to push for safer travel accommodations.","While there are many uncertainties regarding the future of remote or in-person contact, I plan on setting up ways in which constituents will be able to connect to me either remotely or in person. These include setting up flexible office hours over zoom, sharing my platform on social media, and responding to emails or direct messages from my constituents regarding platform topics. However, I do understand that certain students may not have access to technology or prefer to bring up their concerns in person. If permitted, I plan to meet in person with the student population through organized events, door-to-door campaigning, and flexible hours in which I could meet in person to discuss issues or concerns they may face. While I cannot make myself available all the time, I plan to use my organizational skills to balance school and other commitments with the time I have set aside for meeting with constituents. I also plan to communicate with constituents and relay any time constraints or rescheduling back to them. However, I still plan to prioritize getting back to students who wish to address any concerns or issues and do so on time.","While I possess many qualities that make me suited to become the next AS transfer student, the three I believe that set me out the most are my relatability, versatility, passion, and strive for improvement. Being a transfer student myself, I understand the unique challenges and struggles that transfer students face. Having gone through many of these challenges myself, I  plan to represent the transfer student population and help transfer students along the way. What also sets me apart is my diverse background. I understand that not all transfer students come from the same background, and I can even relate myself. Being a first-generation college student and a member of the Latino community, I understand the importance of not just representing majority groups but all communities and adhering to the individual challenges that members of those communities might face. I plan to advocate not just for the communities that I represent but for all groups here on campus and living in Isla Vista. Finally, I believe that my drive for improvement within my community is what most qualifies me for transfer AS senator. I genuinely think that I can make the most significant change and improvement in the lives of all transfer students, making me the best candidate for this position.",I would have to consider myself politically left-leaning. I have lived most of my life in California and likewise would consider myself to have always been left-leaning.,I believe the 72nd AS has done a fair job assessing the student body's needs. I believe that the Senate still has much work to do in promoting student resources and safer travel accommodations.,"I would vote no on the BDS actions against Israel. These sanctions would promote boycotts of Israeli professionals, professional associates, academic institutions, and artistic performances, which I believe would do more harm to the citizens of Israel rather than the government. Action still needs to be taken to help the Palestinian struggle; however, I believe that divestment is the wrong approach.","I believe that UCSB should not be tuition-free for several reasons. The first is that free tuition would drive the prices up of other campus resources. The cost of university-owned housing, books, university health fees, and additional university fees would all go up to compensate for the loss of tuition income. Secondly, if tuition were made free, the waitlist for colleges would go up as more students would be applying to colleges. With UCSB already having a problem with over admitting students, this would not help benefit our school.","Within my two and a half quarters here at UCSB, I believe that the mental health services at UCSB are not adequate for the student body's needs. The two main problems surrounding the inadequate mental health services at UCSB are the lack of promotional content for pre-existing mental health resources and the lack of mental health resources in general. While some mental health resources are available here on the UCSB campus, advertisements for these resources are low. I believe the better representation of mental health resources in forms like email blasts and social media pushes would better help students be aware of mental health outlets available to them. I also believe that UCSB does not have enough mental health resources available to the student body. While there are available mental health resources on campus, I do not think there are enough to represent UCSB's large student population adequately. I would work closely with AS EC to push for creating more mental health resources that would be directed at all aspects of mental health. This diverse range of mental health resources would include outlets for anxiety and depression, grief and loss, time management, addiction, and drug abuse, and sexual assault survivors. ","I do not believe UCSB has handled allegations against fraternities and sororities appropriately in the past and should strive to do a better job moving forward. As a fraternity member myself, I recognize that many aspects of Greek life can and need to be improved on to see better results. I hope that I will be able to change the community I am a part of and help fix the issues that greek life cause. Issues ranging from sexual assault, hazing, and Covid-19 mask and social distance protocol are all areas that greek life organizations need to be improved upon here at UCSB. To limit these issues caused by Greek Life, I plan on pushing for increased accountability of organizations and individuals who break or violate UCSB rules. I plan on working closely with IFC and Panhellenic Council to help enforce and instate rules and regulations that will help reduce risk. Fraternities and sororities that do not abide by the mandatory IFC and UCSB rules should be held accountable for their actions through social probation, fines, and removal of their chapter here at UCSB. Individuals who break IFC and Panhellenic Council rules should also be held accountable for their actions with punishments ranging from school intervention to legal actions if necessary. Most importantly, IFC and Panhellenic council must enforce these rules and properly punish those groups or individuals who violate them.","I am familiar with UCSB’s Title IX office and functions. I believe that the University can do more to help support survivors of sexual assault. While university-run organizations help support survivors of sexual assault, there needs to be more advertisements for these groups. This advertisement should appear periodically on UCSB affiliated social media platforms, UCSB emails, flyers around campus, and discussed within classrooms. I also believe that UCSB should divert more funds to CSO and other safe travel accommodations to help ensure that all students feel safe when traveling on or around campus. I also believe that UCSB should hold students who break or violate the Universities Title IX functions accountable with definitive punishments. These punishments should apply to all students and should not vary from person to person. These rules and punishments should be stated to all students in classrooms rather than through online modules that can be easily ignored.","I believe that UCSB is not effectively serving historically underrepresented groups such as Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities. While UCSB does offer some campus available resources tailored for members of underrepresented communities, these are not enough to help serve these groups' needs on campus. Along with the lack of available resources for marginalized groups, UCSB also predominantly enrolls white students over those in historically underrepresented communities. According to a survey by DataUSA in 2019, white was the predominant race at UCSB, accounting for 31.3 percent of the student population. Compared to historically underrepresented groups such as Black, which only accounted for 2.05 percent of the whole population, or Indigenous, which was even lower at 0.198 percent, there is apparent underrepresentation and under-enrollment at UCSB. UCSB needs to take the appropriate steps to help better serve marginalized communities and adhere to the unique challenges and obstacles they face. These steps include allocating more money to pre-existing and future programs that help better serve these communities. Another step comprises making UCSB more diverse by admitting more students who are members of these marginalized communities. Finally, UCSB should also reallocate money into departmental studies representing these communities, such as Asian American studies and African American studies.","If elected to the 2022 AS Senate, the first resolution I plan on passing would be regarding the housing shortage here at UCSB. This resolution would pass an emergency grant allocating money for housing-based organizations such as IVTU. The current plan UCSB has initiated to solve the housing crisis involves the construction of the controversial Munger Hall. This is not an optimal solution for the housing crisis as Munger Hall is an unethical construction due to its lack of windows and compacted apartments. Instead, UCSB should allocate money to housing-based organizations and hotel contracts to help secure affordable and ethical housing for all students.","While Associated Students is typically seen as inaccessible to the more general student body population, many actions can be taken to make the student body more involved and informed about decisions in the Senate. I believe the main problem surrounding the inaccessibility to Associated Students is the lack of advertisement for the program. To better advertise Associated Students, I plan to push for more social media coverage ranging from more activity on our social media pages to direct messages to new students who may be interested in getting involved. I also plan to push for in-person advertisements in classrooms and around campus through flyers and tabeling. However, some students are also concerned that they are uninformed about the AS Senate's actions. To relieve these concerns, I plan on making the actions and decisions taken by the Senate more vocal to the student body. Through social media, I plan to push for frequent updates and alerts about ongoing topics of interest that the Senate is involved in and address the student body about any changes that may have been voted on. I also wish to push for more student involvement in voting-based issues the Senate deals with. Through frequent polls, whether on social media or in person, students will be able to actively voice their opinion about decisions that the Senate will later vote on.","During this unprecedented time, there are many uncertainties about the direction universities should levitate regarding Covid-19 and the safety of their students and faculty. While it may seem as if things are returning to normal with the removal of The University mask mandate and the ease of social distancing precautions, there are still many actions that UCSB and the Senate need to take to protect the health of its student body. I plan on pushing for continued funding of the student health center to ensure that students can get a Covid-19 test if they believe they have been exposed to Covid-19. If a student does happen to contract Covid-19, I will make sure that they can still have remote learning access while providing them with a high-quality education. To do this, I plan to push for continued funding for rental Chromebooks so that students who do not have a laptop can continue their work. Finally, I plan to work with the AS executive board to form a resolution to allow students who contract Covid-19 time extensions on homework and assignments due during their infection period. While this resolution was previously passed, I hope to renew it this year.","During the extension of Covid-19, UCSB has taken many actions to ensure its students' physical and mental health safety while providing high-quality education to its student body. While UCSB has succeeded in certain areas regarding its responses to Covid-19, there are certain areas in which the University has failed. To start, UCSB has initially done a good job of taking proper safety precautions when transitioning to online learning. During this time, UCSB had responded quickly to statistical data to ensure that remote education was only necessary when Covid-19 posed a severe risk to the student population. UCSB has also done a good job in taking the proper safety protocols when students were allowed back to campus. The required mask mandate, social distancing, and free and convenient Covid-19 testing stations were all positive ways UCSB handled the pandemic. However, UCSB has failed regarding students' mental health during the pandemic. UCSB should have increased mental health services available to its large student body and pushed for more flexibility with submission deadlines for individuals who contracted Covid-19. While certain teachers may have allowed for student assignments to be extended if they caught Covid-19, UCSB should have made this a university-wide rule which would have relieved stress on individuals suffering from Covid-19 and upcoming deadlines."
