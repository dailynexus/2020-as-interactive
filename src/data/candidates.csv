Taylor Tait,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Taylor-Tait-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,1st,Sociology & Geography Double Major,,,"I am running for Senate because I believe what our campus needs is someone who is compassionate and will listen to and value the ideas of all Gauchos, and not only a few select groups. I want to use my experience and privileges to provide a platform for underrepresented groups on campus to express their concerns. As you’ll read below, I am well qualified and have a lot of outstanding ideas that have pushed me to pursue a spot in the 71st senate. 
","Since coming to UCSB, I’ve become involved with a variety of organizations that have helped me grow and prepared me to be a senator. I joined RHA as an Activities Coordinator for Manzanita Village’s Hall Council. It was a great experience that helped me learn the ropes of on-campus politics on a much smaller scale than A.S. Senate. I’ve involved myself in various student activist groups, advocating for the banning of fracking in Santa Barbara and participating in many COLA protests. I also pushed myself to get involved in different communities of our school by joining Club Water Polo. Being a part of a club sport has helped me meet people I wouldn’t ordinarily get to, and has allowed for me to witness firsthand how A.S. impacts all of our students. 
","While in office, the main three issues I plan to address are food insecurity, combating climate change on a local and broader scale, and prioritizing mental health. In depth, I would like to increase funding for campus organizations that work to combat food insecurity such as the A.S. Food Bank. I hope to help these organizations grow so they have enough resources to support more of our student population and eventually expand the variety and multitudes of other life essentials such as toiletries and first aid. In regards to the climate crisis, I would like to enact resolutions that will promote environmental sustainability on our campus. I would like to accomplish this by instating campus policies such as reducing light pollution and energy waste in our campus buildings and refusing to support businesses involved in fracking, unethical palm oil, and other industries that are detrimental to our planet. And, importantly, I want to aid in the efforts to improve our mental health resources and make them easier to navigate through the creation of online apps, increasing funds, and a variety of other means.
","Efficiency and transparency best describe the foundation of my platform. Overall, I would consider my vision to be environmentally conscious and human rights oriented. Mainly, I hope to increase environmental sustainability efforts in our community by raising climate change awareness, bringing compost bins to popular areas on campus, and instating other practices that will help UCSB become a truly green campus. I also would like to address the reality of food insecurity on our campus by growing and expanding our AS food bank, making our farmer’s markets more accessible, allowing guests to use students’ meal swipes instead of charging it to their BARC account, and increasing the capacity of donating meal swipes. As a senator, I will also strive to increase recognition and transparency for all boards, committees, units, and other organizations on our campus. Every Gaucho, both big and small, deserves to have their voice heard. Advocating for improvement of our Student Health processes is something I also prioritize; I plan to start this action through conversations with our school administration. As a senator, I will strive to embody the ideals of all members of our Gaucho community. I’ll take on this position with openness in discussing and advocating for the concerns and well-being of our UCSB community. 
","There are so many incredible groups in our community, if there was enough time to join every board, committee, and unit I would in a heartbeat. But realistically, I hope to be able to work with the Food Bank, Environmental Affairs Board, and the Student Commission on Racial Equality. I would be excited to work in any organization or entity, but these are just a few that I would like to collaborate with in order to achieve the vision of my platform. 
","In the unfortunate instance that our summer and fall quarters move to be online, I plan on doing everything I can to be available and transparent to my constituents. Some of the ways I will do this are to hold weekly zoom office hours and be available for scheduling appointments, so that I have the opportunity to discuss concerns and ideas face to face with students. Additionally, I will be active on my senate Facebook, updating my page constantly with what happens in the Senate and the actions I take to better our community. 
","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I am driven, compassionate, and am eager to learn about and reflect the interests of our students. What our campus needs is someone who is dependable and will work in favor of all our students’ ideals. I’ve spent the past six years working in various leadership positions, growing to encompass a variety of skills that would make me perfect for this position. Some organizations I’ve had the privilege to work with include: Manzanita Hall Council (as an Activities Chair), WE Charity (as a School Liaison), Special Olympics (as a District-Wide Events Assistant Coordinator), and founding an environmental nonprofit that focuses on ocean conservation. Each of these positions has taught me what it means to be a leader and how to become a voice for the people. My work ethic would be best described as resilient, organized, and creative. I have a true passion for considering the perspectives and values of others and finding a way to incorporate them into the bigger picture. For all these reasons and more, I am well qualified and will thrive as your next On-Campus Senator.
","Left-leaning 
","Very Good; the 70th Senate has moved mountains in advocating in the students’ interest. They accomplished so much in the past year, from lobbying to increase various BCU funds and utilizing a sexual assault task force to better combat sexual violence in our community, to reaching beyond our campus to support students negatively affected by the Mauna Kea telescope contruction. What I appreciate about the efforts of our previous senate is how dedicated they were when it came to improving life beyond on-campus means. I want to build upon their work by collaborating with more organizations to provide them more transparency and opportunities. 
","This topic has been widely debated throughout the years at UCSB. Personally, I feel that I am not informed enough to take a position on this topic. What I will say is that UCSB would benefit from exploring the idea of establishing relationships with companies that are confirmed to be ethically sound. 
","It’s no argument that the tuition we students pay greatly supports the multitude of organizations and resources that make our university as great as it is. Although I am not completely confident of whether or not focusing the Senate’s time on abolishing tuition for UCSB is going to be effective, I firmly believe in advocating for reducing our tuition prices. Furthering this, scholarships and other forms of financial aid should be extremely expanded so that they can compensate for tuition and student fees. There needs to be more availability of scholarships so students who come from all backgrounds and classes can be supported. Financial hardships should not prevent people from gaining access to education. 
","From CAPS to Health and Wellness, our campus is blessed to have multiple resources where Gauchos can reach out for support. I especially appreciate how easy it is to discover Health and Wellness events as well as our school’s overall efforts to not only normalize maintaining mental health, but prioritizing it over social and even academic success. Overall, I believe that our mental health services are inadequate due to the large demand that has come to overwhelm our services. Every aspect of mental services I have encountered has proven to be incredibly popular and therefore busy. Resources can be difficult to navigate. Scheduling therapy appointments is a grueling task, especially considering the toll it takes on our students’ already full schedules. Even the crowds of pet therapy dogs during dead week were packed. What I propose is an increase in funding and support of mental health services and an exploration of possibly offering virtual therapy appointments. The foundation of our community is well being, and I stand for investing in every Gaucho’s mental health. 
","The speed of UCSB’s response could have been much faster. In the quarter system, it’s been shown that the fast pace causes things to fall through the cracks, so to speak. But sexual assault is no light matter, and should be addressed with exceptional urgency and care, especially when multiple cases arise in the span of weeks. As in any situation, there could have been things our university could have done to handle it better. Personally, I found the school wide emails, presented sometimes weeks after the incident, to be ill timed. More transparency with our administration's actions, and to really know that there are executives and organizations actively working to address these reports, could help ease the mind of our community in the possibility of future sexual assault cases. Furthermore, supporting organizations including Take Back the Night will help aid the university’s response and actions to sexual violence in our community.
","I believe that Title IX is a decent base for a system to address sexual assault. However, it’s merely a foundation for the complex and careful works that are needed to be put into place in order to smooth out the many flaws of this legislation. Currently, Title IX does a mediocre job in accepting the worth of sexual assault survivors. It also lacks an incentive for our justice system to approach and address these reports with the same speed and effort as any other criminal case. Especially when Title IX is implicated in communities where sexual assault cases are notoriously high, I believe that UCs absolutely need further legislation if they hope to create safer environments. There is more that could be done to improve upon how UC campuses approach these situations. 
","I don’t want to speak on behalf of these groups, but from what I have seen so far UCSB has made waves in representing and supporting its communities that are often underrepresented and mistreated. A variety of student unions, organizations, and specialty housing are features that are unparalleled to some universities in our country. Coming to UCSB, one of the first things that I found captivating was the normalization of introducing pronouns when meeting people. I believe that the little, everyday actions of recognition and inclusion form a massive impact on our community. Promoting this mindset will only strengthen our Gaucho community. As someone who grew up in a SoCal inland suburb, I found it surprising how little recognition our beautifully diverse groups, clubs, and organizations received. In high school, showcasing and supporting the BSU, Polynesian club, and disabled students was something I came to normalize; and with that came an appreciation and admiration for these underrepresented communities. In light of my experiences, I urge for bringing the spotlight to various historically underrepresented groups on campus and truly supporting all members of UCSB is absolutely vital. As a senator, I plan to support these well deserving groups and help them further their voices on our campus. 
","If I am elected to serve, one of the first bills or resolutions I plan on authoring would be to increase funding for organizations that aid against food insecurity. Specifically expanding resources and accessibility to the A.S. Food Bank, farmers market, and more. I feel that this is a priority of mine because food insecurity is a huge concern for many students, especially those who cannot afford the lofty costs of meal plans. Students should only have to focus on their studies and getting involved, not worrying over where their next meals are coming from. 
","As a senator, I would strive to make the everyday functions of A.S. more transparent by keeping our media even more up to date and opening up discussions of A.S. actions. As a first year, I’m still understanding all the ins and outs of A.S., and it’s difficult to grasp an adequate understanding of what A.S. does for our university if you don’t have friends who are older. It’s important to involve our younger Gauchos in campus politics so that they have a better understanding and appreciation of what makes our campus, and, eventually, they can help shape and improve upon the efforts of those who came before them. I hope to bring everyday routines of AS leaders through the means of social media, email, and other various platforms. 
","As we say farewell to President Janet Napolitano and the legacy she leaves, many Gauchos look towards the possibilities of the upcoming UC President. In light of the COLA protests, a priority I see for the next President is openness towards students and faculty. What troubled many with Janey Napoltano’s approach to COLA was her downwright rejection in speaking with students. We as investors of these institutions deserve to have our voices heard. Whomever the next UC President will be, I believe it should be someone to reflect all the needs of our diverse UC student bodies.

Adam Majcher,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Adam-Majcher-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,He/Him/His,1st,Political Science & History Double Major,,,"I am running to be Senator with the 71st Senate because I want to make UCSB a better place than it was when I arrived. Having been a fellow as part of the AS Pearman Fellowship Program this year, I have witnessed Senators make big, positive changes to the campus. Now I feel it’s my time to implement my own positive changes after watching so many people do great work. I have loved attending UCSB so far, this school has given me so much and I am dedicated to improving the student life here. While I adore UCSB, there is always more work to be done, and I have noticed a plethora of things that I think could make even better. Listening to my friends talk about various problems they have experienced, and noticing things myself like the difficulty in learning more about, joining, and advertising clubs inspired me to run for Senate
and make positive changes to things that I noticed were not functioning as well as they could be. I want to make the campus safer, increase student activity and engagement in the community, and make UCSB better than it already is, and I will achieve these goals as a Senator.","I have been a part of various clubs and organizations on campus, such as the Fencing team and IV Arts. However, the thing that I feel has prepared me the most to be a Senator is being a fellow for Senator Tyler Ferguson in the A.S. Fellowship Program. Learning about all parts of AS, including all of the various entities, responsibilities of various positions, requirements for writing a resolution, the resources available on campus, how clubs are financed, and countless other things has really prepared me for being a Senator, and I am very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the program. Furthermore, I have attended many Senate meetings throughout the school year, and have even been a Proxy for multiple Senators at meetings, so I understand how Senate functions and flows. This will put me ahead of a lot of my opponents, as I have the capability to enact meaningful change at the onset of the school year.","Some of my biggest goals as a Senator are creating a new app called the Gaucho Back app, creating a weekend long club rush event in Fall Quarter, overhauling the UCSB clubs website and adding a new “Club Events” tab to Go Gaucho! The Gaucho Back app resolutions would ask for funding in order to create the app (or, alternatively add its functionality to an already existing app like Shoreline if creating a new appproves difficult) and also to advertise it to the student body. This app would allow UCSB students in danger to press a button to immediately notify local authorities to come to their location, saving a lot of time. The goal of this app is to increase campus security by not only allowing a faster response time to any student in danger, but also to deter anyone from putting students in danger in the first place. The weekend long club rush event resolution would be the first resolution that I would write, because it is vital that the club rush event happens relatively early in the school year. This resolution would ask for funds for the various stands and advertisement required for the event to be successful, and I would be in contact with many clubs to get them on board to come and advertise themselves the weekend that it occurs! The club rush would include representatives of UCSB clubs having stands in an area, and students attending in order to learn more about them and potentially join these clubs if they are interested! Another resolution that I would introduce would be a big one that would ask for approval of a complete overhaul of the faulty and unhelpful UCSB club website, and also ask for the approval for a new tab on Go Gaucho that would list campus events that are happening that day/week!","My platform would primarily consist of the campus club overhaul, the introduction of new measures to ensure the safety of students, and the expansion of resources for anyone seeking mental, physical, or emotional help.For the campus club overhaul, I would work closely and communicate frequently with campus clubs in order to organize more events and places for advertisement and ease of communication. Things such as the club rush event that I am proposing cannot happen if the clubs that would be present at the event do not know about it, so it is going to be crucial that I am in constant contact with these groups and their leaders in order to make the entire campus club system better. Furthermore, I would work with the developers and project leads of the Go Gaucho app in order to expand it to include club events. For the Gaucho Back app, I would work with local police departments and CSO’s to plan out an effective way to create the app and their response to it. It is crucial that there is effective communication between UCSB and the local authorities in order to create this app system. Finally, for the expansion of resources for mental, emotional, and physical health, I would work with the Mental Health Task Force, would attend Mental Health Town Halls, and communicate with and work with various organizations on campus such as CAPS, CARE, Health and Wellness, and Student Health in order to spread information about ALL of the resources available to students, rather than just flood everyone into CAPS and have it be overwhelmed (although it is still important to increase the resources given to these organizations on top of spreading information).",See #4 above,"Communication with the student body is absolutely crucial for any Senator to effectively do their job, so should the shift to online courses continue into the Summer and Fall, I would make sure that I am able to be reached by students multiple times throughout the week. First of all, I would hold weekly scheduled zoom meetings for anyone who has ideas, suggestions, or problems that they would like for me to hear and address, and I would advertise these meetings on social media so that students would know about them. I would also hold individual zoom appointments throughout the week for any students who are interested, in order to ensure that every voice is heard. Furthermore, I would frequently post about updates and important events on social media, in order to keep the student body informed on all of the things happening within the Senate and AS as a whole. Additionally, I would have a Facebook or Instagram account specifically for myself as a Senator where I would be active and hold weekly discussion posts that students can comment on with any ideas and changes that they think would make UCSB a better place!","I think I am the best candidate for this position because I have the motivation, experience, and ideas necessary to effectively make the campus a better place while I am in office. I have been a part of AS throughout this year as a part of the Fellowship program, and through this I have gained tons of knowledge on how AS, and specifically the Senate, runs and functions. I am familiar with how meetings flow and how to write bills and resolutions, so I am experienced enough to effectively utilize the position in order to make positive changes for the campus! Furthermore, I have a lot of ideas based on my own firsthand experience, and the experiences of my friends and various UCSB students that can greatly improve student life, especially for first year students like myself, in the coming years. Something like the Gaucho Back app can greatly help increase campus safety, and the revamp to the UCSB club website and introduction of events on the Gaucho Back app can substantially increase student engagement with the campus, and both are relatively creative ideas that can increase the quality of campus life substantially. I am also extremely motivated to make these changes happen! I have watched the 70th Senate be extremely impactful and make tons of positive changes in the past few months, and I’m ready and excited to create positive change for the school myself!","left-leaning 
","Very Good. Having attended many Senate meetings and witnessing various legislation that passed, I do think that the 70th Senate did a very good job at addressing the needs of the student body. From bills such as the International Student Bill to demanding rollover swipes, from passionately advocating for increased campus security to supporting the COLA strike, I think that this year’s Senate actively represented the wants and needs of the student body. I do wish that the 70th Senate focused a bit more at improving mental health facilities and spreading information regarding campus resources, however.","While I fully acknowledge the importance of the issue of divestment, I think there is too much gray area on both sides of the argument to take a firm “yes” or “no” stance. I look forward to learning more about the issue and consulting students to make a decision that best represents the stance of the student body.","Yes. I do believe that in an ideal world, education of all levels should be tuition free and readily available for anyone who chooses that path. However, until a better system is established nationwide and/or in California, some form of tuition is necessary to keep UCSB running and, especially, to give faculty a satisfactory paycheck. I believe the problem is moreso in the higher government of the United States rather than UCSB itself, and that tuition free education for all at UCSB is very difficult to achieve by the school itself. Rather, United States politics must fundamentally change.","No, the mental health services at UCSB are far from adequate. A friend of mine who was seeking an appointment at CAPS was told to wait in a multi-hour line just to sign up for a three month waitlist! Efforts such as dog therapy days and massage chairs are admirable, but far from adequate for a University that is home to over 20,000 students and requires the completion of multiple mental health modules for first year students. An important part of my campaign is to substantially increase the funds given to CAPS, greatly increasing the amount of staff in the facility, which in turn would help with the ridiculous wait times. Furthermore, I aim to expand the resources available to victims of physical, emotional, and sexual violence and spread information about their existence so that students are able to know about them should they ever need them. Additionally, there are many resources available to UCSB students that are poorly advertised by the school that offer services similar to those of CAPS. Groups such as the Mental Health Task Force and events such as Mental Health Town Halls are trying to spread information regarding things such as the Alcohol and Drug Program, Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), Health and Wellness, and Student Health Services. As a Senator, I would continue the efforts of these organizations, and work with these programs to continue improving the mental health counseling available for students!","Yes, the university could have handled the situation much, much better. While the complaints that the response was slow are entirely valid and accurate, I think the bigger failure was that the university did absolutely nothing to prevent potential future incidents of sexual assault on campus. UCSB needs to take a proactive rather than a reactive approach to physical and sexual assault, actively taking measures to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place rather than simply giving a delayed response that does not fix anything after horrible incidents like this happen. One of the most important parts of my campaign is the creation of an app (ideally named Gaucho Back) that has an emergency distress button that immediately notifies local authorities to come to one’s location. The presence of such an app that allows for extremely quick action would not only deter people from committing acts of assault, but it would also allow for help to come much faster than something like calling 911. Furthermore, there needs to be more resources on campus for victims of assault, something that I will focus on improving should I be elected to the Senate. There have been multiple cases of sexual and physical violence on or near our campus in the past year, and it is vital that these individuals receive the help and support that they need. Another big part of my campaign is spreading information about and advertising various clubs, organizations, and facilities on campus, and giving students the information of the existence of such resources for victims of assault can greatly help in them being utilized for students to receive the help that they need.","Title IX is not an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. While the law was a relatively effective as a stepping stone in the goal of creating campuses free of various types of discrimination, it fails to specifically account for many detrimental issues, such as sexual assault and transphobia. Furthermore, with the current political administration’s continuous efforts to reverse protections of Title IX, especially regarding transgender students and the investigation of sexual assault cases, the law is not powerful enough nor specific enough to effectively prevent sexual discrimination on college campuses, much less sexual assault. There needs to be more provisions put in place to guarantee that all sexual assault cases are thoroughly investigated, that transgender students are provided rights that are associated with the gender that they identify with, and clearer, more defined laws to prevent sexual discrimination and sexual assault. It is imperative that there are better measures implemented by the school to combat sexual assault on our campus, and a key part of my campaign, the implementation of an app that allows a UCSB student to immediately send a distress signal to local authorities, notifying them to immediately come to that student’s location, would go a long way in helping with this.","Part of what makes UCSB so special is how diverse the backgrounds of the community are, and how students from all over the world and from completely different walks of life are able to come together to learn and create an amazing community. As a gay student myself, I personally have never experienced any forms of harassment or discrimination directed at me at UCSB, and there are numerous resources that I am aware of for the LGBTQ+ community on campus, which is something that I do think UCSB is doing quite well. I am a strong believer in equity over equality, and, while there are many resources and groups available at UCSB for students who are members of historically underrepresented groups, more work can always be done. It is important to remember that members of racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities very disproportionately account for cases of violence and abuse both on college campuses and in the United States at large. This is just another reason why it is so crucial to effectively deal with and prevent cases of physical and sexual violence from occuring on our campus, and why UCSB’s response to the multiple cases of sexual assault and the case of anti-LGBTQ+ violence that occurred this year was so unacceptable and inadequate. Taking a proactive stance and creating measures that would prevent instances of violence from occurring in the first place is crucial to the wellbeing of the community, and, again, the Gaucho Back app would be a great place to start. The International Student Bill that I was a student sponsor for is a crucial step in increasing the inclusivity of A.S. and ensuring that all groups on campus have a voice and are represented, as international students have historically been extremely underrepresented within student government at UCSB. Finally, I will make sure to be in constant contact with students from all backgrounds in order to effectively represent and respond to the needs of the student body. I will do everything in my power as a Senator to ensure that every student has a voice, feels safe, and is represented during their time at UCSB.","While I believe that the creation of the Gaucho Back app is very important, the first thing that I would pass is an overhaul to the campus club website and the creation of a club rush weekend within the first quarter of the school year. One of my biggest goals as a Senator would be to increase the information spread of events, clubs, and facilities, and these organizations usually recruit towards the start of the school year, so focusing on this would be my first priority as it is so frontloaded in the school year. One of the biggest problems that I experienced at UCSB is the difficulty of finding, advertising, and joining clubs. There were small club joining events during the weekday that lasted an hour or two, and I had class during them. The clubs that are usually lining the path by the arbor are just a fraction of all the ones present on campus. I would work with club leaders to establish a “club rush” weekend where clubs would have stands in a large open space, and students would see flyers for it all over campus and be able to attend, learn about, and join various clubs on campus. Furthermore, the website for clubs is a bit of a mess as it is difficult to navigate and has little to no information about any of the clubs that are listed. Having a club database online would help students find, learn more about, and reach out to clubs that they are interested in and join them in order to get more involved in campus life during their first, and subsequent, years. Finally, I often see friends going to incredible events going on around campus on social media that I never even realized were happening! As Senator, I would push for an extra tab on the Go Gaucho app that would list all events that are occurring within the week. This free advertisement would greatly help spread information about the events that students and members of the UCSB community are hosting, and make the information for them easily accessible for the student body. The success of UCSB as a campus is largely linked to the engagement and involvement of the student body in campus activities. Bolstering this and the entire system around it can only help improve life for the whole community!","As mentioned above, one of my biggest goals as a Senator would be to greatly increase the information present regarding clubs and campus events, and this includes A.S. A.S. events would similarly be listed on the Go Gaucho app, alongside other community events, and the ability to sit in on Senate meetings or attend Senator or Executive office hours would be made much more public in an attempt to get more students involved in A.S. activities. Furthermore, social media is crucial in communicating to the student body, and I would frequently post about important events or bills that are being discussed in order to get students more involved and encourage them to come to speak at Senate meetings about their thoughts, concerns, and suggestions. The school newspaper covers important and groundbreaking updates that happen in A.S., and as a Senator I would work with various on campus media sources in order to publicize events happening in the school. Communication and information are crucial in not only informing the student body of what their representatives are doing in office, but also to encourage students to take an active part in their community and have a say where their money goes to.","The top priorities for the next UC President is to, first and foremost, listen to the students and faculty of UC campuses and react effectively with their concerns and needs. Campus safety must be a top priority, especially given the physical and sexual violence that has occurred within the past school year. Furthermore, with huge events such as the COLA strike and COVID-19 outbreak currently happening, the next UC President must react well to being under pressure, and be ready to address crises that can sprout at any moment. The students at UC universities must be the top priority of the next UC President, and our safety and education should be their top concern. Communication between the UC President and the students is vital, and assembling town hall style events with UC students could be a great way for them to learn about our concerns, complaints, and suggestions. Addressing current issues such as the COVID-19 outbreak and how it affects our campuses and meeting the needs of Graduate students who are receiving wages below the poverty line are both crucial in the moment, however, I think that most importantly the next UC President must be willing to communicate and cooperate with students and faculty in order to resolve these problems and any future ones that may occur.",,,,"My platform would primarily consist of the campus club overhaul, the introduction of new measures to ensure the safety of students, and the expansion of resources for anyone seeking mental, physical, or emotional help.For the campus club overhaul, I would work closely and communicate frequently with campus clubs in order to organize more events and places for advertisement and ease of communication.

It is crucial that there is effective communication between UCSB and the local authorities in order to create this app system.

Adam Bagul,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Adam-Bagul-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,1st,History of Public Policy and Law,,,"I am running to be an on-campus senator with the 71st senate for a wide variety of reasons.
Civic service is an incredibly powerful idea and practice, it improves the quality of the
communities and people that are lucky enough to enjoy it. Service is a significant ideal that I
foresee continuing to drive me in my life and one that I will hold dear. However, it is only
worthwhile if there are people and ideas that are worth serving. I am so grateful to find myself
at UCSB where there are no shortages of people and ideas to advocate for and service roles in
which to do so. AS Senate is a wonderful place to work through both of those needs, being
privileged enough to serve by advocating for those students and issues that deserve it.
Additionally, I have an innate passion for leadership. I love being a part of something bigger
than myself, even more so being more involved and holding responsibilities that maintaining a
leadership position carries. Leaving high school I joined the United States Marine Corps, in
basic training I felt compelled to go beyond expectations and I soon found myself in a squad
leader billet. I held that billet until graduation and earned a meritorious promotion. This was
the beginning of understanding and realizing my passion for leadership. I still currently hold a
leadership billet in the Marines and deeply enjoy leading my marines as well as mentoring,
caring for, and holding them accountable. When I arrived at UCSB I found myself at an
informational meeting regarding Hall Council. Go big or go home, right? I ran for Hall Council
President and have been fortunate enough to win and serve during the 2019 - 2020 school year.
I have found that while student leadership is much different than leadership in the Marine
Corps, my enthusiasm for it remains all the same. I want to continue to chase my passion for
leadership and what better way than to increase the scope and be a part of a group of
representatives for all UCSB students. The amount of reasons I have for running for senate
goes on and on and include but are certainly not limited to, meeting more of my peers at
UCSB, challenging myself in both running and maintaining the senate position, and the
personal and professional development that will occur no matter the result of elections.","In my role as San Rafael Hall Council President I have been involved with two organizations
that while similar in function, prepared me for a position as an on-campus senator in different
yet overlapping ways. As San Rafael Hall Council President I worked closely with the
Residential Housing Association, or RHA, and San Rafael’s very own Hall Council. In
working with RHA I learned the basics of being in a legislative body, such as parliamentary
procedure or parli pro. Working and volunteering on different committees within RHA aided
me in gaining more experience with collaboration with other students on non-academic
projects and learning more about UCSB and life on campus in general. Attending weekly
coordinating board meetings within RHA exposed me to many different student organizations
and the events they host that make UCSB such an exciting community to participate in. Hall
Council on the other hand gave me experience holding a more administrative role in a student
government setting, such as being responsible for holding weekly executive and coordinating
board meetings and office hours. Both RHA and my Hall Council have prepared me to be an
on-campus senator in teaching me the issues that are common in residence halls and with on
campus students as well as many of the resources that are available to alleviate or move
forward with said issues.","Of my platform the three most important issues to me are resolving the inefficiency regarding
veterans’ benefits, urging the university to create more composting bins, and subsidizing /
lowering the cost of on campus parking. Regarding the first, I would begin researching further
into the details and deficiencies in the process that is leading to the hold up. During these early
stages I will likely find a student sponsor, likely another student veteran. The resolution itself
would roughly be along the lines of, “Whereas it is the responsibility of UCSB to certify
necessary documents in a timely manner, and; this has not been the case in recent years.
Therefore let it be resolved by the Associated Students in the Legislative Council assembled:
That the student body of the University of California, Santa Barbara strongly urges the
University to hire the necessary additional staff / correct the deficiencies and hold those
responsible for those delays accountable”. The second bill being related to additional compost
bins on campus would also begin with research and collaboration with related organizations
and departments at UCSB. The resolution itself would likely be one of support: “Whereas,
UCSB has committed itself to striving towards being zero waste, and compost bins are an
effective way to further this effort, and campus presently does not compost bins close to many
on campus residence halls. Therefore let it be resolved by the Associated Students in the
Legislative Council assembled: That the student body of UCSB supports the proposed plan to
create more composting bins on campus”. The third resolution would start no different than the
other two, with research and talking with related departments namely the Transportation and

Parking Services. This resolution / bill is harder to speculate on details because there are many
unknowns that will be answered with further research but if the UCSB is unwilling to negotiate
lowering parking permit prices then a conversation will ensue both within AS and with myself
and RHA to see if our organizations could subsidize a realistic amount of the cost. All of these
bills are rather difficult to “detail” because the ideas have multiple paths that have yet to be
revealed.","My platform consists of four main points, which I will lay out in a nonspecific order. I aim to
diminish parking costs while serving in AS Senate, through collaboration with the Office of
Transportation and Parking Services and RHA. This will most likely start through contacting the
Office of Transportation & Parking Services and Parking Rate Payers Board to inquire as to why
parking is priced as it currently stands and other relevant details. With updated and more specific
information I as well as other interested senators will most likely formulate the next course of
action whether it be trying to foster collaboration between AS and RHA to help subsidize
parking costs or putting heavy pressure on the university to lower these costs. Pushing for access
of the 200 free prints that students are allotted to be extended to the ResNet Printers in the
Residence Halls can be accomplished through speaking with the Housing Department and
Gaucho Print. Through entering a dialogue with both of these entities, we can better understand
why ResNet Printers are not included in this resource and take steps to try and include them.
Again reaching out to RHA for support in this matter would be incredibly helpful and only help
the chances of this idea becoming a reality. Urging UCSB to add more compost bins on campus
in order to help our campus further responsible environmental practices. This piece of platform
will require coming into contact and working with many departments at UCSB such as Facilities,
Sustainability, student and university organizations focused around environmental sustainability /
composting, and within AS itself with the office of the EVPLA and interested senators. Like
most issues in order to effectively take on this challenge information regarding the problem itself
and the roadmap to achieve the desired endstate is crucial to its success. Facilities and
Sustainability will yield information regarding how we can set up and begin the process, relying
on the other environmental organizations for help and support. Last but certainly not least, an
essential part of my platform would be advocating for student veterans by putting pressure on
university administration to hire the necessary staff and implement necessary changes so that
student veterans never get their benefits late again. I plan on learning more specifics regarding
the problem through talking to the SVO, other student veterans, and going through the process
myself. After learning more about where the deficiencies in the process occur, pressure and

urging UCSB to correct the problem will be more effective and better directed whether it be
through a bill, resolution, petition, changes made in operations and procedures, etc.","There are a multitude of organizations that I aim to collaborate with within my term as senator,
many directly pertaining to the issues and pieces of my platform that intensely hold my
attention. For example I hope to work with the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board, the
California Student Sustainability Coalition, The IV Compost Collective run by IVCSD, UCSB
Sustainability / Student E-Coalition, Zero Waste Committee, and other similar organizations.
Through working with these organizations I hope that we can further awareness, gain wide
support in favor of, and ultimately push UCSB to place more compost bins on campus. Time
and time again I have seen compostable food waste mismanaged by either being placed in the
garbage or left in the grass all over UCSB. Our university should continue striving to be zero
waste and investing in more compostable bins is a significant step towards that goal. Another
group of organizations that I would like to collaborate with are the Office of Transportation
and Parking and RHA. I believe that On-Campus students pay far too much for university
parking spots and through opening a dialogue / working with these entities change can be made
to lower or further subsidize parking costs. Additionally, a huge personally important issue that
I hope to resolve is the tardiness of tuition assistance that many student veterans are entitled to
and depend upon. I will be seeking advice, collaboration, and assistance with the Student
Veteran Organization, Military Family Organization, and Veteran Resource Center to make
sure this problem is resolved and does not persist.","It is clearly a difficult time for all UCSB students operating remotely and not being able to
enjoy the school that we hold so dear. Aside from not being in Isla Vista, seeing your friends,
and feeling normal these circumstances make access to TAs, professors, and on campus
resources more difficult and in some cases non-existent. The same applies to AS Senators,
however it is easy and more importantly senators’ responsibility to make themselves more
easily available if online courses continue through summer and fall quarter. Very similar to
quality TAs and professors, I would be open to hosting office hours weekly through Zoom for
any UCSB students that would prefer that form of communication. I would also be incredibly
vigilant with my school email and would respond to emails promptly. In addition to Zoom
office hours and reaching out through email, I plan on being incredibly present on my Senator

Facebook page and all social media. I think the use of social media and especially a Senator
Facebook page may offer a more approachable and personable way to get in contact with
constituents. In these unprecedented times of isolation, communication is key and as a senator I
do not plan on forgetting that whether I am on-campus or not as I greatly look forward to
speaking with fellow UCSB students.","I am the best candidate for the on-campus senate position because of my leadership experience
and determined hardworking nature. My time in RHA and Hall Council have taught me many of
the problems that are common in on-campus living. RHA and Hall Council have also introduced
me to many resources that are available to help on-campus students. An important part of being a
leader is being able to maintain a cool and level head in high stress situations, a skill that I am
very familiar with as I have and continue to lead marines during dynamic live fire exercises.
Situations like the one we are facing together all over the world highlights the need for level
headed leaders who will not get overwhelmed when stakes are high. I have proven to my
marines, my fellow RHA members, Hall Council members and more importantly myself that I
am an effective leader and I will continue to be as a senator. My mother once told me if you’re
not giving something one hundred percent, then why do it? When I set myself to a goal or
commitment I make sure that I give it my full effort. I am the best candidate for the position
because I am capable of filling the role more effectively than other candidates and if elected I
will put maximum effort in being the best senator I can be.","Other. I’m independent, I really don’t subscribe to solely left or right wing points of view.
Additionally, I do not allow my political beliefs affect my judgement when working in a
representative role, I will be focused on the opinions of my constituents rather than my own.","Good. As a first year that is very new into involvement with AS, as far as I can tell they’ve

done well. I was very pleased to hear about the resolution regarding roll over swipes in the
dining commons which is a change that is overdue. Additionally I have not heard any major
scandals or deficiencies in AS Senate this year so I do not have any negative judgement to
pass. However, on the other side of not hearing much about AS, it seems that the Senate and
AS in general needs to put a greater focus on awareness into current AS events and resolutions
/ bills. Many students, myself included, are not well informed on AS’s work and that in of
itself is a problem as they have a responsibility to effectively communicate their progress.","OTHER. I hope to learn more during my time as a senator so I can pass more informed
judgement if the vote comes up once again.","No. While every student, myself included, would be ecstatic to no longer pay tuition I do
not believe that it is feasible. Tuition accounts for an incredibly large portion of the
University’s income and is responsible for funding the bulk of virtually everything at UCSB.
Additionally I do not foresee California miraculously volunteering to fund all the UC’s out of
nowhere. I do believe that the UC has the means to significantly lower tuition and should do
so. Tuition-free attendance would be preferred, but it is not realistic at this time. There needs to
be a balance between too expensive and free, and unfortunately it is clear that it is presently
heavily skewed toward the former.","I am aware that the University’s Counseling and Psychological Services or “CAPS” is a very
well known and advertised resource on campus. CAPS is said to offer professional counselors
and therapists as well as help from other students called “mental health peers”. While the staff
and all the resources at CAPS are incredibly appreciated by the students of UCSB it is clear

that CAPS is failing to serve the needs of UCSB students in many respects. There is a dire
shortage in staff at CAPS, specifically licensed counselors and therapists, contributing to
incredibly long wait times. The shortage in therapists and counselors is also demonstrated in
CAPS’s outsourcing of some service to Acacia Counseling and Wellness. Outsourcing some
service is better than inaction and adding to the already extensive waitlist that students must
contend with, but with the resources that UCSB holds CAPS should be better equipped to
handle students’ needs. Additionally, roughly over 12 percent of the student population at UC
Santa Barbara are international students, the majority of them from China. Keeping UCSB’s
large Chinese student population one would think that there would be a counselor or therapist
that can help these students in Mandarin or Cantonese. Unfortunately this is not the case, this
essential resource is less accessible to a huge segment of our student body, who are away from
home in a country much different from their own with all the added academic stress that any
college student faces. Subsequently, I believe that action needs to be taken to resolve this
deficiency.","UC Santa Barbara’s response to the multiple reports of sexual assault occuring on fraternity
property during the 2019 fall quarter could have been better, specifically in timing. The rape at
the Sigma Pi house took place in early October. The University first responded to the reports of
the incidents by using the timely warning system, emailing all students on October 17th. In this
email they informed students that two incidents of sexual assault took place with a minor
description giving some details, following safety tips and resources. This email was sent far too
late, there is no reason why this email was received by students over a week and a half later.
The next day the IFC announced that they had put a 5 day moratorium on all fraternity social
activities. This decision also came too late and did not go far enough. They later changed the
moratorium to be indefinitely which I believe was the right call. On October 28, the university
sent out another timely warning email again giving a brief description, a description of the
suspect, and revealing that it had taken place at Sigma Pi. This is also far too late for a follow
up email to be sent especially if it is releasing pertinent information that may have been
necessary to include in the first email. UCSB later held a forum in November to address
students’ concerns. I believe this is also far too late and the university’s general focus on
women defending themselves rather than the root cause is concerning as well. Simply put I
think UCSB took most of the right steps, all extremely late making it lose much of its
effectiveness.","I do not believe that Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses.
As it stands Title IX itself is a sound and solid law in terms of setting the framework of
provisions and directives to work through cases of sexual assault, however the most important
part of its effectiveness is enforcement and implementation. Objectively, the enforcement of
Title IX in regards to the intensity of universities across the country in their response has been
drawn back in the transition between the Obama to Trump administration. This change is
propagated significantly in part by Department of Education Secretary Betsy Devos. It is
difficult to quantify the change in response from the change in administration, but nevertheless
it is still present. I strongly believe that it is not a smart or moral decision to scale back
intensity of sexual violence investigations or reprecussions in any case. The system that Title
IX has put into place can also put stress on survivors or victims of sexual assault who may not
want to move forward legally and disclose the details of their assault. In these cases CARE
works as a vital supplement to the system in place, allowing victims to work through emotional
trauma without disclosing information to mandated reporters who are required to come forward
to law enforcement.","While I do believe that there is always progress to be made and concerns that need to be
addressed, I do believe that at a fundamental level UCSB is serving historically
underrepresented groups. These groups include minority communities ranging from Latinx,
Black, Korean, Chinese, Middle Eastern and many more, to the LGBTQ+ community. The
administration and the community strongly supports these groups as seen through the support
given to organizations such as Black Student Union, Korean-American Student Association,
Queer Student Union, Vietnamese Student Association and many more. In my time in
Residential Housing Association, I’ve seen many different minority organizations come
through to ask for support or funding, the vast majority receive the entirety of their funding
requests and those who do not receive full funding usually receive partial funding. Apart from
student lead organizations the school’s own resources such as the Black Resource Center, The

Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, El Centro, and the Multi-Cultural Center
shows the University’s commitment to these historically underrepresented communities. The
progress and efforts that the university has made are not the end all be all to action that can be
taken. I believe that many underrepresented communities have needs that aren’t being
addressed and I want to champion that.","If elected to serve on Senate, my first bill or resolution that I would plan to author would
definitely concern student veterans. It is not an issue that is widely known or talked about on
campus, regardless it is still present. UCSB has not been processing Veteran’s benefits on time
leaving student veterans with much added stress affecting them academically, emotionally, and
most of all financially. Most people are aware that veterans usually attend university for free
because of earned benefits through their service, and this generally is the case if they choose to
use their benefits. However, through talking to other student veterans who have been at UCSB
longer than I have I have found out that the UCSB does not have enough staff to certify
documents in order to process benefits. Benefits are being processed late for many student
veterans leaving them to pay high unexpected costs until financial aid comes in, one student
veteran even having to take out a personal loan to cover tuition in the meantime. Needless to
say, my first resolution would be interested in hiring the necessary staff to certify VA benefits
and pushing the administration to hold those failing to do so accountable. As it is time sensitive
and a recurring problem that veterans should not have to meet friction with.","When I first began writing my response to this question I began describing holding an event at
least once a quarter, similar in nature to a social but its primary focus being to bridge the gap
between students and AS. I detailed that the meetings could start with a brief overview on past
ongoing, and future actions in AS Senate as well as giving general information regarding all
the opportunities and resources in AS, later giving time for students to meet with senators and
express ideas, concerns, and observations. These events already exist, they are called forums
and they are required by legal code in AS. I am glad that this concept is a reality, however how
effective can forums be if they are not well known or advertised. In order to mitigate the
feelings of inaccessibility towards Associated Students I aim to focus energy and effort to raise
awareness regarding forums and improve them further by looking into how they currently

function. A system in which senators can inform and involve the general student body and also
receive feedback and ideas from their constituency is only effective if there are students who
are aware of this resource and participate in using it.","I believe that the next UC President should embody what the University of California should
stand for: the education and wellbeing of students, staff, and community instead of corporate
interests. It seems more and more that universities across the country are shifting their concern
for profit instead of their purpose, students, and faculty. The next UC President should make it
a priority to move the UC in the opposite direction, away from this shameful trend. President
Napolitano’s successor should immediately be making an effort to lower tuition AND taking
steps to secure more resources for all UC campuses. A concrete example of this may include
but certainly is not limited to, working to reimburse part of students' 2020 Spring Quarter
tuition as online classes pale in comparison to the value of in person classes and the resources
being physically present on campus includes. President Napolitano’s successor should also
educate themselves on the 2020 Winter Quarter COLA strikes. Through becoming further
informed on the details of the situation, I hope that they will come to understand that graduate
students are a clearly essential component to our system and deserve a livable wage that is
appropriate compared to local living costs. COLA being a subject in which it seems President
Janet Napolitano has fallen short, it would seem necessary that her successor should correct
this situation.",,,,,,,

to be done. Joining Campus United has exposed me to so many people, including the
AS President Alison Sir, Internal Vice President Alli Adam, and so many more who do
everything they can to make UCSB the best it can be. Being someone who has no
experience in UCSB’s student government felt like a disadvantage at first, but I
quickly came to realize the outside perspective it gives me. As someone who spent this
year not only living on campus but also working within my residence hall, I gained a
lot of knowledge on how these halls are run as well as what we can do to provide for
students. Along with this, there are so many resources available to students that they
just are not aware of that I want to help bring into the light to support small
organizations as well as students in need. One of the most important things to me is
making sure students always feel represented; an effective government is one that
gives everyone within it a chance to voice themselves, even if that be through a
representative. I want to be a part of the positive change we see on this campus and I
want to represent our student body as well as I can.\","Throughout my first year, I was very active in my residence hall’s Hall Council. We
met every week and discussed upcoming events, funding, and what we could do to
make our residence hall great for everyone. As a floor representative, I was able to
work alongside other floor reps and decide on necessary funding for different events.
One of the key aspects we would always look at is if the event is inclusive to as many
people as possible, and how we could make it more inclusive. Those conversations
really showed me how easy it is to make sure everyone feels like they can be involved
within their community, and that was evident even in the events my committee and I
held throughout the year. Along with this, I am involved in UCSB’s Army ROTC
program. This program has taught me so much about leadership and teamwork; having

to work with all kinds of people to solve problems and make sure everyone is involved
actively is crucial in making sure plans run as smoothly as possible. I believe these
skills translate directly into a senator position where I would likewise be having to
consider many people in every decision I make. Communication is vital between
leaders and the people they represent to ensure that everyone has a voice as we move
forward together and I believe that through these types of involvements, I have been
able to learn how to do just that.",NO ANSWER,"My platform, as I am running for On-Campus Senate, will be centered around the students that
are living in residence halls. The vast majority of these students are freshmen with little to no
knowledge about how campus life works and the resources available to them. In office, I would
be creating ways to keep as many students informed as possible about how our school works,
whether that be through mass emails, social media platforms, or even fliers around the school.
Along with this, I would also be working with some second year students living in residence
halls such as San Rafael and Manzanita Village, doing my best to ensure that these students feel
just as involved as anyone else. One of the greatest things I have learned during my short time
working with Campus United is just how many resources that our school has to offer. As a
freshman, I was never exposed to many of the committees and organizations dedicated to student
life at UCSB and I would do my best to spread that type of information to students. These groups
include but are not limited to mental health facilities and organizations dedicated to food supply
for students in need. In growing the amount of people these groups impact, I would also be sure
to keep in contact to make sure they are always funded properly and given enough to provide and
function efficiently.","One of the biggest focuses of my campaign is ensuring proper mental health care for all students.

Organizations such as UCSB’s Mental Health Taskforce have already done so much for our
students and I would continue our work with them as well as the Public and Mental Health
Commission to see that we are continuing to push for the best resources we can offer. I often talk
about how important it is to be as transparent with students as possible. We often feel like our
campus is so large that there is no way to keep track of what is going on, but I believe especially
in these confusing times that it is not only possible but crucial that we keep everyone informed
on the ways we are moving forward. This can be done in so many methods ranging from online
groups to apps like Wildfire, but I know I could work with UCSB’s Publications organization
and even the Media Center to continue pushing information about events as well as changes and
important news to all students. Of course, there are so many ways to relay this information
already, but students often end up lost between countless emails, websites, and posts. There are
multiple news sources such as the Daily Nexus that are dedicated to keeping students informed
about issues campus wide that they may be interested in, and these are resources that I want
students on campus to utilize to ensure that there is as much transparency throughout the student
body and administration as possible.","Although this shift into online courses has made connection very difficult, I believe that if we
understand how to work through it together, we can make the best of it. Social media platforms
and other methods of communication such as messaging apps have made it easier to stay
connected than ever before and I believe it is absolutely vital to continue utilizing this
technology moving forward, regardless of if we are in-person or online. That being said, because
this online transition has been so drastic for all students, I have noticed people coming together
through all platforms such as Instagram trends or Facebook groups, just proving that we are all in
this together somehow. If necessary, I would be completely open to online communication and I
would even encourage some sort of forum for students to contact their representatives directly so
there will always be that active communication that allows students to be as involved in their
student body as they can be. We can even open some type of dropbox where students with
concerns can drop in suggestions for representatives to consider. Ideas like “office hours” for
student body representatives can be driven the same way professors and TAs have been keeping
themselves open for certain times throughout the week via email or even Zoom calls. This allows
for those students to contact their representatives with concerns and questions in real time, and it
is crucial that we continue to push for voices in the student body to be heard.","I would be the best candidate for this position because I believe in the power of student voice.
Throughout high school, I was in many leadership positions such as president of multiple clubs
and even the track and field team captain for two years. In that time, I dealt with many situations
where the people who looked up to me as a leader were not motivated to move forward and from
those experiences, I learned how to push through hardships as a team. During my time here at
UCSB, I took it upon myself to be a floor representative for San Rafael’s hall council where I
represented the residents on my floor when discussing events and money spent in our residence
hall. This gave me some insight on how to properly represent a group of people, always making
sure to talk to some residents beforehand to get opinions on ideas as well as keeping everyone
updated through posters and Groupme messages about upcoming events. I have always felt that
transparency is crucial to get things done and properly represent people, and that is a value I will
continue to uphold when in office. One of the most important lessons that I carry with me to this
day is that everyone has such a unique perspective on the world that shapes the way they react to
problems, so you can never take someone’s ideas for granted. In that sense, I believe I have a
very open mind and I will always be willing to hear the suggestions and requests of my
colleagues as well as constituents when it comes to passing bills or making decisions.","Independent, I think it’s important to look at
individual policies and solutions rather than identifying blindly with any party outlook
on politics.",Very Good,"No: This topic is not one I know enough to
express a fully formed opinion about. I will always advocate for human rights, and I
definitely would love to see support from organizations such as our university in
efforts to relieve those in impoverished countries. However, without more personal
research on the topic, I think it is unfair of me to express any perspective, and I would
definitely be open to speaking more on this issue once it becomes one I am more
familiarized with.","No: Although it is essential to have some resources to help
students afford their education as well as enforcements to ensure that universities are not
scamming students and making education inaccessible to certain groups, there is countless staff
within our campus that deserve an adequate paycheck for their hard work. From T.A’s to
janitorial services, there are people in our system we cannot overlook. Along with this, there are
also vital resources that are provided to students that we can expand through AS efforts and

committee resolutions that would only go to further benefit students which would not exist
without tuition costs.","As an incoming freshman, I remember being constantly preached to about the impressive
extent to the mental health services provided at UCSB. However even as a freshman, there
have been instances where I have felt the need to take advantage of these so-called resources
where I was given a wait time estimated by the months. My experience is not surprising to
many students, I have talked with countless people (including but not limited to my own
friends) who have dealt with this same struggle of needing the resources that were presented
as far more functioning than they really are. Just the idea that there are two months worth of
students that are desperately seeking mental health services at any given time on our campus
should not sit well with anyone. One of the problems seems to be that students just do not
know all of the programs available for them. UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force continues
working directly to bridge the gap between mental health resources and the student body,
including a new website that helps students navigate support systems that are available to
them in a way that makes it easier to get the help they need. We need more coverage on these
systems to reach more students who may need the help but are unable to find it because it
otherwise results in an overflow of people to one program that may not even have what they
are seeking. While I see on-campus resources such as mental health events coordinated in
residence halls, these events do not reach out to the vast majority of university students who
need more than a face mask and a movie night. It is vital that we continue to show how many
students care about each other as well as themselves in the area of mental health, and we
must continue to emphasize that mental health is just as important as physical health. As an
AS Senator, I would work closely with groups like UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force to
ensure that we continue to improve the services we can provide to all students.","In a situation like that, it is obviously going to be hard for the university to go through all
evidence and processes necessary while making sure the students feel like there is any effort
being made. I am a strong advocate for constant transparency and there is no reason that we
should not be kept in the loop in a situation that could be dangerous as well as concerning for
many if not all students. There is only so much we can do to stop individual actions, but
seeing sexual assault become such a pattern on university campuses is alarming and cannot
go unaddressed. I have had to take the same online courses given to all students regarding
sexual assault and I have seen the ways to be an active bystander, but all these “solutions” do
is teach how to stop the crime in action. I do not believe these methods are preventative
enough and I think there is so much more we can do than wait until it is too late. I would like
to advocate and continue to support the work that the UCSB Safer Social Events Task Force
has done because we need more emphasis on reformative methods that change the way we
stop sexual assault on our campus.","Title IX is interesting because it is fundamentally a good idea as it prioritizes equal access
to education regardless of gender. However, its recent implementation in California
universities is very controversial. Because this is such a young topic that I know so little
about, I do not want to falsely speak on the account, but from the research I have done
thus far, I do not believe Title IX adequately addresses sexual assault on campus because
it forces the victim to relive their experience in front of many others in a courtroom.
While I do believe it is important that a statement be made in order to emphasize a fair
trial, this experience is not only traumatizing for the victim, it also pushes so many into
silence. Everyone in a situation where they are sexually assaulted wants to speak up, but
requiring them to speak in such an uncomfortable setting forces so many people to just let
it go. This not only fails to bring justice to students, it perpetuates the idea for the
assaulter that they can get away with anything, putting more students at risk.","As lucky as I have been to attend such a richly diverse and accepting campus, I believe
there is always work to be done when it comes to representation. Every week I am sent

emails and I look around campus to see flyers about events that not only serve to
represent different groups, but also many that involve interests and hobbies that bring
people of all different groups together. From my own experience, the best organizations
are the ones that are not the “most accepting,” but the ones that look towards the
character of a person rather than focusing on their born traits. While it is vital that we
continue to represent all groups and ensure diversity is never overlooked, it is also
important that we do not stop there and we continue to support organizations that are
inclusive to interests and the development of relationships that dive deeper than the
surface to build a more connected campus.","I will never stop advocating for the improvement if not reformation of our school’s mental
health care facilities. UCSB takes student’s mental health very much into account; I have
seen residence halls, professors, and even the chancellor address topics involving students’
mental health in the past. However, it is a different story talking to everyday students. I
have spoken with many people, including both friends and strangers throughout campus,
to see what common opinions are surrounding UCSB’s mental health services and the
answers are almost always the same; inadequate. Of course, this campus is known and
often brags about its advanced resources, but students do not feel they have proper access
to mental health care, regardless of how educated they are on the amount of resources we
have to provide. I firmly believe that mental health is just as important as physical health
and it is concerning to me that in a university where students are constantly under severe
pressure and stress, they feel that they are not given adequate access to basic healthcare.
We must approach a reformative bill that looks at mental health with that exact
perspective-- that it is just as important as physical well-being. I think if we were to invest
more attention and funds into our existing programs, it is completely possible to expand
them and to ensure that more students are cared for as efficiently as possible. Luckily,
through my short time with Campus United, I have already had multiple personal
conversations with leaders who are dedicated to this same issue. Even our current AS
President, Alison Sir, has done so much including organizing a Mental Health Town Hall
to initiate a broader conversation about how we work through mental health issues as a
community. These are the types of efforts I would continue to support and help grow in
office.","Social media has become such an amazing outlet of relaying information to students.
However, just as well as it is a resource, it can also be seen as a threat to our ability to
decipher between true and false information. There are countless forums such as
Facebook where a great majority of students can join groups that share information
that may be important for others to know. I am a part of many of these groups,
including the Wildfire app that gives students the run-down on events that concern
them in real time. It is crucial that we continue using these forums because students
do not have the time to sit around and try to figure out what is going on and how it
will affect them. In recent events, Chancellor Yang constantly sent emails regarding
how to move forward and the effects of the recent virus on student life and classes in
the future. This consistent transparency not only keeps students in the loop, it lets
them know that their school cares about them and the quality of their education. It is
important that we keep all students informed about how things around campus are
working and what resources they have/what may affect them in the future, and I
would push for more of this to be done through social media so students have
constant access to that information in their hands.","I think one of the biggest concerns students have is transparency with how their tuition is
being used to make their campus as efficient and beneficial as it can be. We always see a
new building being built on campus or some form of construction that will not affect most
students’ day-to-day lives. Truth be told, these projects serve the university more than they
do the students. Everyone attending UCSB can name at least one area in which we can
improve, a very large one being fixing the bike paths. This suggests that there is a lot we can
do in developing resources that students can directly see helping them. Along with this, we
prioritize our sustainability efforts greatly, but there is so much more work to be done. The
next UC President definitely needs to continue the efforts to make the UCs as climate
friendly as possible as we aim to be a zero emission campus. These ideas all seem to tie in
together; it is crucial that students understand where their tuition is going and how it is
helping them as they pursue higher education so they can continue to work with AS leaders
and their own committees in advocating for causes and funds that they feel are important.
The next UC President should continue to work directly with students across UC campuses

to hear their concerns and help fund and support their efforts to find resolutions. We need a
president who is as eager to make positive change the same way I see students across
campuses working to see progress.",,,,,,,
Yehuda Jian,max,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yehuda-Jian-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,"He, Him, His",2nd,Philosophy,,,"I am running for senate because I have a passion for changing my community for the better. I
love the people and atmosphere at UCSB and know that I can make the experience for future
students even better. As the Director of Legislative Accountability this year, I have connected
BCUs to their assigned Senators, handled any miscommunications or complaints about the
assignments, created a more modern and organized accountability system for both BCUs and
Senators by moving it from paper to digital, and I sat on the TPS/ratepayers board as the liaison
from the office of the IVP.  From early on I was drawn to student leadership and aside from my
role in AS, I’m on the Executive Boards of both Chabad and SSI. Even outside of my official
leadership positions, I have taken the initiative to lobby AS members and administrators alike to
advocate for the needs of the communities I am a part of. I was one of the main student voices
that supported the current Kosher/Halal food program and I continue to push for a more
permanent and steady solution with the creation of an entirely Kosher/Halal dining hall.",See above.,"The first bill I would introduce is a bill that would use the excess fees from students that AS
doesn’t use to reduce the overall cost of school through either a partial refund of whatever
wasn’t used, setting up a fund to be used for need based financial aid, or using the money to
subsidize cheaper textbooks. I would work with Finance and Business along with multiple facets
of the administration to make this a sustainable reality so that students get more from the
hundreds of dollars they pay to AS each year. The second would be a resolution calling for
better academic accommodations for religious students. There is no school policy about
religious accommodations other than the obligation to move a final. Whether it’s midterms,
quizzes homeworks or even attendance, the decision is up to the professor and that means that
religious students will never know if they can rely on accommodations or not. This resolution will
show religious students that someone is in their corner and I will work with the administration,
Hillel, MSA and various other religious orgs to make the demands of this resolution a reality.
The third thing I would pass would be a bill to allocate funding for the implementation of the
Blue-Light system and put together a task force to get it done. I will work with administration,
IVTU, IVCSD and the EVPLA to put together this task force and get the job done. It has been
way too long since the implementation of the first Blue-Lights on campus and I think it is about
time IV started feeling safer at night.","The most important parts of my platform and how I plan to achieve them are detailed above.
I also plan to work with the SRB, Library and UCEN to implement more AS charging stations so
that when midterms or finals come around, these spaces are more capable of dealing with the
increase in students spending a lot of time there. My final platform is to work with IVTU, IVCSD
and the EVPLA to get more street lighting in Isla Vista and build on the work that has already
been started in years passed.","I have detailed above who I will be working with for each part of my platform and will be open
to working with and hearing from any org or entity not already listed. I am here to give a voice to
my constituents and am happy to work with any org or entity that helps me do that.","I will hold weekly zoom office hours that will be posted on my Senate Facebook page and will
be open to making appointments outside of those office hours. I will also be available through
email, facebook messenger or whatever platform of communication works best with the student.
I plan to check all these forms of communication by the end of each day and respond to them as
soon as i read them or as soon as I have an answer. If for whatever reason a student cannot
find a time to actually meet with me, I will create a google form that will be posted on my Senate
Facebook page with a comments box that I will use to get feedback from students and still have
a way to listen to what they need to talk to me about. All of my personal social media account
information will also be made available along with my phone number, I understand the
importance of being available to my constituents and am prepared to go the extra mile to do so.","After spending a year in AS I have a clear idea of what is going well and what needs
improvement. I have specific ideas and plans on how to go about making these changes. I am
very excited to work with other senators who want to make change like I do and look forward to
working with Senators with different opinions to find a middleground where everyone benefits. I
have experience directly consulting Legal Code at the request of the IVP and I’m familiar with
the procedures of Senate meetings so I can hit the ground running once I get elected and start
getting things done immediately. I have experience working with AS entities and the
administration and have made vital connections with those people that will help me achieve my
goals. I am very open to new ideas and will advocate for any student who comes to me with a
voice that needs to be heard. I care about our campus and will do everything in my power to
make it better.","Centrist, I have some opinions that are to the left and some to the right but they average out
in the middle.","Very Good, as the Director of Legislative Accountability, I have had the unique opportunity to
watch senators work and I witnessed a group that is overall very dedicated to the student body
and who really care about the important issues.","Divestment is connected to an extremely controversial issue with valid claims on both sides.
I personally am against Divestment and am pro-Israel. I would like to clarify however, that this
does not mean I don’t recognize the struggle of the palestinian people. I believe that the true
path to a peaceful resolution of the conflict is by building bridges between the communities not
by building walls, whether they be physical or financial. I don’t approve of most of the things the
Israeli government does or has done in the past, but one could say that about many countries
and yet I don’t see a reason to divest from companies that do business with those countries. As
a proud member of the Jewish community I believe that the Divestment resolution is
Anti-Semitic and the only proof needed for that is the majority of the Jewish community agreeing
that it is.","Yes, I believe that all higher education should be free but I would say that the best way to
get there is gradually with a good plan that doesn't leave teachers underpaid and resources and
facilities underfunded. UCSB was founded with the idea it would be free. I think that that is the
right way to go but just cutting tuition immediately presents too many problems. The best path in
my opinion is to gradually lower tuition over a period of time to allow the necessary adjustments
to be made.","From my personal experience, I think that the types of services available are adequate but
they do not have enough locations. Students should be able to easily fit a visit to CAPS into
their schedules, and if they spend most of their time around the Chem Building or Physical
Sciences, that can be quite difficult. The staff I have encountered at CAPS have always been
respectful, understanding and helpful. When I am elected, if any of my constituents expressed a
desire to fix the Mental Health system or make it better, I would not hesitate to do everything in
my power to do so. Mental Health is just as, if not more important than Physical Health,
especially to a student. It is the responsibility of any university to give their students the best
chance to succeed and that goes hand in hand with making sure all of their students can access
whatever resources are necessary to stay healthy, mentally and physically. For example, the
University could partner with Acacia to build a system where students who can’t get a CAPS
counselor, are helped without having to do any extra work.","The university did not handle the situation with the fraternities well at all. Sexual Harrasment
and Sexual Assault are not matters that should be taken lightly. After the allegations made in
Fall Quarter, I would expect those Frats to be kicked off of campus. Simply putting Frats on
social probation for the remainder of a quarter that was already almost over is not nearly
enough. Frats have to take real responsibility for what happened. I think they should have been
required to have some sort of real education on what sexual harassment or assault are and how
to actively prevent them. When the school fails to respond properly to something like this, it
sends a message to the student body that the school doesn’t care. This message is not only a
sad one but an unacceptable one. If the school required Green Dot training for all OSL groups
including Greek Life, I think it would be a good indicator that the administration cares and is
working to create a safer environment.","I think that Title IX is not strict enough on universities. Just mandating a system of report is
nice, but not enough. Schools should be forced to put policies in place that are in line with the
legal repercussions of sexual harrassment or sexual assault. The university should not be given
the opportunity to kick the can down the road and hope someone else does the job. People
need to be helped as soon as these things happen and not at the leisure of some bureaucracy.
For too long the voices of people who have been harassed or assaulted have been silenced for
no better reason than “They were asking for it dressed like that” or “they should have manned
up and said no”. We can no longer allow this bigotry to exist and when I am elected senator, I
will fight to eliminate it.","As someone from a religious background, I can say that while UCSB has some great
resources for underrepresented groups, it definitely could use some more work. For the
Religious Community specifically, there are very few ways that the University accommodates
our holidays and traditions. I once was forced to drop a class I needed for my major just
because the department refused to give me the accommodations I needed to have an equal
playing field with the rest of the class. When I asked the department head why they refused to
accomodate me they said that there was actually no policy that pertained to my situation and
that it was above their power to do anything about. In the end it took too long to set up a
meeting with the person who could have helped me and I was forced to request a late drop to
avoid the low grade I would have gotten from missing the first three weeks of the quarter. When
I am elected one of my first orders of business will be to set this right and work with the
administration to create real and sensible policies that take into account the needs of religious
students, and any other underrepresented groups who have to work harder to keep up just
because of their background.","The first bill I plan to author is a bill that will put money back in the hands of students. For
years AS entities have been given budgets that are larger than what they actually spend, and
the extra just goes into a rollover budget that they can use next year. All that does however, is
create even more extra money sitting around doing nothing. I plan to change that. I will write a
bill that puts any excess funds at the end of the year back in the hands of students. This would
lower the overall cost of student fees by way of reimbursement. This money could also be used
to lower the price of textbooks or create a scholarship program for students in financial need.
AS gets around 14 million dollars a year to work with, if even 5 percent of that were to be given
back to students  it would free up $700,000 to give back to students. Imagine a UCSB where
that 600 dollars a year you pay actually saves you 600 dollars in textbooks, that's the UCSB I
want to create.","When I was a freshman I wanted to get involved in student government but I couldn’t even
find the name Associated Students, let alone the room it was in. The Pearman fellowship is a
great way to get involved with Associated Students and the number of fellows it yielded was
much higher this past year than years past, but I think it can get much bigger and more
accessible. When I am elected, I will work with the Office of Admissions and the Creative Media
Unit to get the word out to students before they even start their first quarter at UCSB. As the
Director of Legislative Accountability, I know first hand what it’s like to try and keep the Senate
accountable. In my position in AS I have already created a digital system of accountability to
replace the extremely out of date one which was still on paper. When I am a Senator I will write
legislation to get updates on the  senate agenda, senate office hours, senate meeting times and
other information posted not just on the senate website, but on the Daily Nexus and Bottom Line
as well.","With the recent events of the COLA strike, it became clear to me that President Napolitano
did not place enough emphasis on the needs of Grad Students and TAs. My number one priority
from the next President would be an administrator who will fight for the needs of their undergrad
and grad students, their faculty and their staff. Many of us have been through the hell that is
going to advising from three different departments and somehow having 7 different answers to a
simple question. I want a President who will work towards a more cohesive campus. Our UC
President should work towards sensible policy that makes living as a UCSB student easier, not
more confusing. When students gather together to ask for something that is quite basic, the UC
President should listen to what they have to say and work towards a real compromise if they
don’t have the means to fully grant these requests. The UC President is supposed to be the
embodiment of the voices of students, faculty and staff, I want the next one to fit that
description.",,"I am running for senate because I have a passion for changing my community for the better. I

Yuval Cohen,max,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yuval-Cohen-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,2nd,Political Science/Middle East Studies,,,"I became involved with Associated Students my freshman year of college and I absolutely fell in
love with it. The community and people that make up AS all share a similar passion for UCSB
and want to see it become the best it can be. During my short time at UCSB, I have been able to
use my passion to enact change throughout my communities. By serving on the senate, I hope to
accomplish so much more. I am running because I want to be a voice for my community, I want
to represent the students, and I want to create an environment that everyone wants to be a part of.
I believe that senate is the perfect platform and place to come together and collaborate on ideas
that can truly make a difference, and that is something that I want to be involved in.","I have been involved in the AS Office of the President for two years now. My
freshman year, I was a fellow, and this year I am currently the Director of Dream
Scholar Affairs. As a fellow, I got to learn more about AS as a whole and all of the
moving parts that make it successful at UCSB. By my second year, I knew I wanted to
continue my work in the Office of the President. I had watched the individual who had
my previous position do a phenomenal job, and I wanted to bring my ideas to the
table. Being an undocumented student, I am very connected to my position as Director
of Dream Scholar Affairs. It has allowed me to make connections throughout my
community and raise awareness about undocumented students. I have seen things that
need to change, and I know what path they must take. This experience specifically has
prepared me to be a senator because I know how AS functions and what I can do as a
senator to make an impact.","The first resolution I would like to introduce revolves around helping undocumented
students. In June, the Supreme Court is expected to release their decision on whether
or not DACA will continue. This decision is going to impact a great number of
students, including myself. I know that before I became the Director of Dream Scholar
Affairs, I was totally unsure about the resources we have at UCSB for undocumented
students. I want to create a bill that works to advertise these resources and raise
awareness throughout the entire school about undocumented students. We need more
forums, events, and information for students, documented and undocumented. A
second resolution I would like to introduce is to partner with the Isla Vista Compost
Collective and increase the amount of compost bins throughout Isla Vista.
Sustainability is very important to me, and IVCC does a great job of composting. My
house is filled with compost bins, in Isla Vista and at my family’s home. Since IVCC
just partnered with the Isla Vista Community Services District so that they can have
more resources, this year would be a perfect time to increase access to compost bins
throughout Isla Vista. Restaurants, homes, lecture halls, and more places in Isla Vista
should have available composting bins. A third resolution I would like to introduce
while in office is to collaborate with the Recreation Center and possibly IVFP, UCPD,
and CFOs to create access to self defense classes. This school year, the community
definitely felt a lack of safety and security. I believe that all students should have the
option to learn how to defend themselves from any situation. No one should ever be in
a position where they feel vulnerable. Self defense classes are a perfect way to gain
that sense of extra security.","My platform revolves around the students and meeting their needs based on what I
have seen at UCSB for the past two years. Through my connections, I have gained a
good sense in realizing the things that need to change. My goals while in office will be
to revolve my actions around the students. There are so many voices and opinions that
never get heard, and my platform hopes to reach all of those students who want to see
change but do not know how to do something about it. I am very passionate about each
of my platform statements because I have a connection to each point. My biggest goal
would have to be increasing transparency and communication. I have always been a
very open and honest individual, so I hope to reflect that on my position as a senator as
well.","I hope to work with Undocumented Student Services (USS), the Mental Health Task
Force, Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), Environmental Affairs Board, AS
Office of the President, AS Food Bank, Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), and many
more. These are the main organizations and entities that I would love to collaborate
with. I believe in their mission and I want to do everything I can to help them
accomplish what they wish. I love coming together with different, yet like-minded
individuals because I know that it can result in something great.","I plan on hosting “online office hours,” like a lot of professors and TAs are currently
doing. I will be on Zoom at certain times or people can schedule a time that works for
them to meet with me. I want to be as available as possible, so I will be very active on
social media and platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, etc. I want constituents to
have full access to me and know that they should never hesitate to reach out. I believe
that by staying involved online and on commonly frequented pages or apps, I can
make it aware to students that I want to and will work to meet their needs.","When I was growing up, it was always hard for me to know what I wanted to be. All
the kids my age would have their dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers. But I was
all over the place, and I would simply base my future on what Netflix show I was
addicted to at the moment. When I began applying to colleges, I still did not know
what I wanted to do. I had to reflect on my entire life. That was when I realized that
everything I had done up to that point screamed leadership. I was in student
government all 4 years of high school and I would even go to Sacramento and lobby
every year. These were always things I loved doing, and I never thought I could ever
turn it into a career or something more. Senior year, I promised myself I would
become involved in student government again wherever I ended up. All of freshman
year, I joined everything that sounded remotely interesting to me, which is how I fell
in love with AS. UCSB took my love of community, leading, and government and
showed me that there was so much more I could bring to the table. My experience and
passion has been building up to this, and I know that I would do an amazing job as a
senator. As someone who has always had to work a little bit harder to prove myself, I
know that I can advocate for students and make the changes that they wish to see
within their university and community. I am overall super excited for this entire
journey no matter what happens.",Left-leaning,"Very Good. I believe that the work of the 70th Senate has been very sufficient. They have accomplished
a lot, my personal favorite being the creation of a new Senate seat for international students.
But as always, more work can be done to meet the needs of students.","No. This is a very controversial topic, especially since UCSB is the only UC that has not
voted in favor of this resolution. There is a great lack of knowledge circling this topic
and I believe that we must educate students on what the results of favoring BDS
would look like. Although I would not vote in favor of it, I will be open and impartial
to all other views and I am always eager to learn more.","No. UCSB should not be tuition-free at this time because
of all the resources and academics on campus that
must be funded. But, I do believe in lowering student
fees and making college more affordable to all through
continued lobbying efforts to fund the UC.","I believe that UCSB has a lot of services available to students. As a member of the AS Office
of the President, I was involved in coordinating the Mental Health Town Hall. During the
town hall, I learned a lot more about available resources on campus, CAPS being the main
one. A big issue with CAPS is the long wait times. There are a lot of instances where
students cannot wait for an appointment. I think by advertising the other resources, such as
peer groups or the emergency call-line, students can be educated on other options they may
have. Overall, CAPS can definitely improve their efficiency, but there are more services
available at UCSB besides CAPS that should be publicized and utilized more.","I believe that the university could have handled the situation better in the beginning. They
were slow to provide resources and help to students in need or those questioning everything
that was happening. Students really needed more information, yet they did not receive
enough information from the university reports. I believe the current exec board did a great
job of providing outlets to address the sexual assault instances, such as creating the UCSB
Safer Social Event Task Force. As time passed, the situation was addressed better, but the
initial response could have been better.","I believe that Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses.
But, there are things we can do to improve the system. The expansion of programs to help
fight sexual assault and providing more resources to survivors should be available. As a
Senator, I will work towards this by meeting the needs of my constituents.","The university itself should focus on hearing the voices of these communities and
meeting their needs. The student-led Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+, and other programs
should receive extra funding and help with expansion. These communities are doing a
great job with events and promoting awareness on campus. Overall, UCSB is making
great improvement in providing resources and practicing inclusion.","My first resolution that I plan to author if I am elected to serve on the Senate is a bill to
continue and expand the Mental Health Town Hall. This past school year, the Mental
Health Town Hall was run by the Office of the President. I believe if the Senate backs and
funds this event, it can grow and reach even more people. This town hall was very
beneficial for me and answered a lot of my questions surrounding mental health,
especially at UCSB. More students should be attending this town hall because everyone
should be educated about mental health. I think that this bill will greatly benefit and help
students.","I believe that with all of the resources we have, we should be advertising them to
students more. Through social media influence, email, and on-campus
advertisements, students can become more informed.  I also think that the student
body should stay informed through programs like GOLD and GauchoSpace. Students
regularly check these systems, and if there are updates from Associated Students on
these sites as soon as students log in, I think that could have a great influence on
UCSB’s campus.","Being UC President is a very important role that should be filled by a qualified and
experienced individual. I think the top priorities for the next UC President should be about
maintaining strong and adequate health services on each campus. Considering what is
currently going on in our world with the corona virus outbreak, health should be the number
one priority. At a campus like UCSB for example, our student health center should have
easier access. More important topics include lowering tuition, providing enough resources
for undocumented students following the upcoming announcement of the Supreme Court
decision on DACA, and sustainability on each campus (composting centers, reducing waste,
etc.).",,,,,,,
Catherine Flaherty,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Catherine-Flaherty-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,she/her/hers,2nd,Political Science,,,I am running because I am committed to representing the students of UC Santa Barbara in the Senate and ensuring a transparent and inclusive environment. I want to make the work of Senators more accessible to the everyday student so that they are confident in knowing their needs are working to be met.,"My work in the AS Office of the President as both the Executive Assistant and Director of Alumni Relations has prepared me for work as a senator. Through those positions, I was able to see the inner workings of Associated Students and learn about the various student groups and organizations integral to our campus. Through my work in Campus United and in viewing Senate meetings, I have been able to see the work of past and current senators and reflect on what I believe they are accomplishing and what they could improve upon.","I plan on introducing a resolution to continue support for the Mental Health Town Halls, founded by the Office of the President Alison Sir. Students and community members need spaces where they can express what our services are providing and falling short of. Additionally, many students simply aren’t aware of the vast amount of resources that we have, and I think that different organizations should be highlighted. I also plan on working on a bill to ensure there are adequate emergency funds in place for every need and a “guidebook” on where to access vital resources in times of great need and turmoil. Additionally, I plan on working with the IVPD to host Town Halls in order to improve relations with our local law enforcement.","Within Isla Vista, I plan on partnering with the IV Tenants Union to promote their Rate my Landlord system to ensure renting experiences are transparent, hosting Town Halls with the IVPD to improve relations between our students and our police, reinventing the Pardall Center to be a hub for students where they can access critical resources and promote local events to increase community, and working with CSOs to make sure that students feel safe both on and off campus. Regarding campus resources, I plan on improving emergency responses and learning from the Cave Fires and Covid-19 pandemic to create a central guide where students can access resources to alleviate housing, food, educational, and health insecurities, supporting survivors of sexual assault through confidendial resources and educating the community through prevention and awareness, continuing the Mental Health Town Halls to strengthen resources and eduacation, and lowering textbook prices and encourage professors to go online so that materials are accessible for all.","I plan on working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union, CAPS, the Book Bank, Commission on Student Well Being, Food Bank, Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), Gaucho Books, Human Rights Board, IV Community Relations Committee, Legal Resources Center, Public and Mental Health Commission, and Public Safety Commission.","I plan on hosting virtual office hours, where I am available on my computer to directly answer emails, phone calls, Zoom calls, etc. I also plan on being heavily active on my Facebook page so that my constituents are informed on what I am working on. Through posting the agenda, maintaining my social media, I hope to provide the transparency and connection needed to succeed in this role and ensure that I am representing my constituency to the best of my abilities.","My involvement in the Associated Students Office of the President has made me familiar with many of the organizations on campus, as well as the needs of many students. I am determined to use the knowledge that I have gained to provide solutions, through collaborating with senators from all parties, to my constituents’ concerns.",Left-leaning,"Very Good. They have done a great job, under the leadership of Internal Vice President Alli Adam, in keeping the goal of serving students in mind and ensuring professionalism in every aspect of Senate. I have especially supported the international seat bill and the resolution to support COLA authored by Tianna White and Olivia Campos. Something that can be improved, however, is increasing awareness of the work that Senate does. If elected, I hope to increase visibility for the general student population and make it more accessible for the
average student.","It would be a disservice to project my own opinions on the topic without consulting my constituents first. Until I hear from students at UCSB on all sides of the debate, I cannot vote with confidence and represent them to the best of my abilities.","I firmly believe that students from extremely low-income backgrounds should not have to bear the costof tuition. While in the foreseeable future free tuition is not feasible for every student, we need to focus onincreasing financial aid wherever possible. Tuition is necessary to support the resources used by students, butwherever the cost can be alleviated, it should. Perhaps more practical is analyzing alternative ways to allocatefunds so that it is the most effective for all.","While we are heading in the right direction, I believe that there is a lot of work to be done surrounding mental health on this campus. This past year I have served in the office of the AS President, Alison Sir, and have had the opportunity to learn about and support the many projects our office holds. Sejal Anuraji, ASOP’s Mental Health Coordinator, developed UCSB’s first Mental Health Town Hall - an event that I plan on
supporting through the Senate next year, if given the chance. I was one of a handful of students who attended the pre-session, which was critical in developing the content of the Town Hall. There I spoke with the leading administration in CARE, CAPS, ADP, Health and Wellness. It was evident that they wanted to help and recognize that there is a higher standard that they need to reach, but the funding just isn’t there. Through education, lobbying, students have the ability to demand institutional change. We have the power to put pressure, because there is only so much the administration can do other than work with what they are given.","I do believe that the university could have handled the situation better. I attended the public forums held in November and found the dialogue held between the administration and students to be long overdue and incredibly necessary in proceeding forward. In my opinion, the university should have been sending out more emails to keep students updated so that speculation could be either confirmed or denied. Additionally, of a handful of the emails sent out, the wording came across for many students as victim-blaming and unproductive. The university needs to stand firmly with survivors, and through these conversations I saw that they were open to feedback and genuinely committed to creating a safer space for all students. Additionally, in regards to the public forums, live streaming could have helped streamline information so that students who were working or in class had access to the same information and were able to see the administration’s responses to important questions.","I believe that Title IX is an adequate foundation in combatting sexual assault on UC campuses, but it falls short in supporting safety in our Isla Vista community where the majority of sexual assaults occur. Title IX rules apply to university-owned buildings and spaces, but many students do not live in these buildings after their first year. The University must protect and advocate for all students who are survivors - regardless of whether or not an assault happened on campus or off. ","I believe that UCSB does a good job at raising awareness for many historically underrepresented groups, but that there is progress still to be made. The awareness for every group is not there. groups, but that there is progress still to be made. The awareness for every group is not there. The university funds should be equitably allocated towards supporting these groups so that their outreach is the most effective, they have resources to tend to issues specific to their community, and each student’s voice is heard, respected, and acted on.","If I am elected to serve in the Senate, the first bill or resolution I plan to author is to set up emergency funds for pandemics or emergencies. Especially through the fires and now the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for an emergency fund is glaringly obvious. In addition to emergency funds, I want to create a central guide for emergencies where students can find the questions to their answers regarding housing, food, technology, and more. This will be widely distributed to ensure that it reaches every student when events like this occur, with information such as how to gain access to the emergency funds.","Associated Students is such a large organization with so many facets, and the work of all groups needs to be advertised more. In terms of the Senate, I have found it helpful that the sessions are live streamed and posted on Facebook. Although not everyone has a Facebook, this is a great start in ensuring transparency and accountability. Expanding the reach of these livestreams, as well as accompanying it with a brief summary of what bills or resolutions passed/did not pass, would be incredibly helpful. Through student media, GOLD, and Gauchospace, I believe this can be accomplished.","Continuing on from the issues raised this past quarter, I believe that her replacement must address COLA and the needs of graduate students. Protests on UC campuses garnered national media attention, and because graduate students are the backbone of our institution, they need to know that they are supported. Additionally, the UCs could work on coordinated responses to natural disasters or emergencies, such as the fires or COVID-19. Finally, mental health is an increasingly important topic on college campuses. Expanding services and improving wait times should be a priority in order to ensure all students' health and safety.",,,,,,,
Nathan Le,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nathan-Le-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,he/him/his,2nd ,Mathematics,,,"I am running to be an Off-Campus senator, because I believe I can serve as a liaison for the underrepresented groups of which I identify with: the Asian American, First-Generation, Low-Income, and LGBTQ+ communities. As someone who identifies with these communities, I recognize that I am just one voice of many different perspectives. Although I have my own agenda as to implement tangible change for our community, my desires may not encapsulate the entirety of the ideas that these communities feel most prominently for. Above all else, I want to bring forth and highlight the ideas and concerns that may be unheard.

Especially living within Isla Vista, which holds a massive population of the UCSB campus within two square miles, I believe that many concerns and issues are overlooked. I recognize that all groups have their individualized set of problems. Over the course of my time being here at UCSB, I’ve been exposed to so many pressing issues that require resolution. I am awed by the advocacy that my fellow peers have shown me, and through this, I’ve been inspired to take a stand against things that need change. All of us have the common goal of wanting UCSB to improve itself, and I believe that I can effectively do so. ","I currently hold a leadership position within my fraternity, and I’ve been able to really recognize the intricacies that go behind any organization that is on a college campus. There are so many different personalities, personal issues, and situations that one must be considerate of. With my experience of holding these leadership positions, such as philanthropy chairman and secretary, I recognize how important it is to understand how crucial it is to have participation from all to make a goal work. One must be mindful as to not negatively affect a certain group. Also, by working as a Supervisor at The Arbor, I’ve been prepared in refining my leadership skills. There are many moving parts that come with an organization that all work together with different positions to create fluidity. The Arbor has over 80 employees with associates, superivors, and managers all working together as one to make sure the store runs smoothly. In a sense, A.S. is the same. Many different positions work simultaneously together in order to work towards a common goal. Another way that I have been prepared, is that  I am also prepared to represent many different opinions and backgrounds. UCSB is an amazingly diverse school with the campus not being afraid to voice it’s opinion. I identify with many underrepresented groups whose opinions and thoughts should be heard. ","One of the main bills that I would like to introduce while in office is the creation of a donation center where students can donate food and school supplies and other necessities to. Living in Isla Vista, one of the largest issues that I have noticed is the abundance of food waste. A lot of food is thrown away simply because they will not be eaten by the person, rather than it going bad. With the creation of a donation center that accepts a variety of items such as food and school supplies, we can help minimize the food wastage as well as combating the pressing issue of food insecurity that looms over college students. School supplies are another thing that students will be able to donate. As a student myself, I found myself having extra blue books, pencils, scantrons, and notebooks that I ended up never using. By allowing other students to donate these items, it will allow for students who may be struggling financially to have one less thing to worry about. One of the main organizations that I will want to work with is the Pardall Center within IV and the Food Bank on Campus. I will work with the offices and resources necessary to make this possible, because this is something that I am passionate about and have found myself in situations like these.

Another bill that I would like to introduce would be initiating more community engaging events within Isla Vista that bring the people that live off-campus together. Oftentimes, many college students see their living situation as just that, a living situation, and do not fully recognize that Isla Vista is a community. Although on a map, it is a mere 2 square miles, it feels much larger, hence why there always feels like there is a disconnect between all of the subsections of IV. With community engaging events such as a holiday decoration house contest, it brings the IV community together for a friendly competition and overall improves our appearance. I believe that with these small events, it will help modestly boost the moral of IV. I will work with the IV Community Center as well as the proper entities necessary.
","One of my overarching goals centers around boosting the community moral and how we can make our community stronger and tighter. Isla Vista is a community that relies on the support of one another to be successful and to thrive. Some people see IV as merely just a living space, but do not recognize the true potential that our great community offers. At the end of the day, we are all Gaucho’s with the common purpose of going to school at UCSB, but we all have a part in making each other’s college experience the best it can be. To reiterate a few of my platforms, with the creation of a donation center, increased community events, and increased resources for under-represented groups, I believe that it will effectively solve a couple issues that my constituents may feel. Please see the above question, for some expansion about a couple of my platforms and how I would achieve them.","As I answered previously in questions 3, 4, and 5 I want to work with the IT department and the proper management teams that facilitate social media advertisements in creating a better way of displaying school/community events within Isla Vista. Specifically, I want to implement digital billboards on Pardall Tunnel that will screen information 24/7. I would also like to work with the A.S. Food Bank, Pardall Center, and the Isla Vista Community Center in creating more safe spaces for underrepresented groups, initiating a donation center, and hosting more community events. Of course, I will also speak and work with any other organizations or entities, because my vision may not incorporate a valid viewpoint to which someone might have.","With the uncertainty of the course of COVID-19 within the U.S., many institutions are considering making courses online for the summer and fall quarters. I hope this is not the case, but if it is, I will make myself available through opening up office hours via Zoom weekly so that I can get any input from my constituents regarding their general needs or concerns. Especially during these times of unprecedented amounts of Xenophobia against Asian-Americans, I want to be there for my communities and make sure that they recognize they have support from the campus. Hatred, racism, and xenophobia are not welcomed to our campus and it is with proper communication that I can be notified of any instances that occur.

I will also make myself available through my social media accounts. Whether it be Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat I will make sure that the students recognize that I am just a message away. Another way that I will make sure that my constituents recognize that I am a resource that they can go to, is going to club meetings if they are held online. Even having just a quick 2 minute announcement, it will allow for the exposure to know that I will be there for them. 
","One of the main reasons why I believe that I can serve as Off-Campus senator well, is my ability to continually learn and be flexible while maintaining my integrity. I recognize that A.S. and the issues that surround a college campus will never be stagnant. With the position of a Senator, one should be educated upon their stance on a certain subject, but should still be open to discourse and the exchange of ideas from other perspectives. Many exterior issues will inadvertently affect our campus in more ways than one. Having a properly informed opinion as a senator is extremely important, and I believe that this is one of my strengths. Before deciding on a definitive stance, I prefer to make sure that I speak with the proper communities in which the subject may directly affect.

Being a supervisor at the Arbor and holding chair positions within my fraternity, I recognize the importance of all parts that go into running an institution such as ours. No matter how big or small their roles are, we all come together for the betterment of UCSB. If I am elected as an Off-Campus senator, I will be super excited to work with my fellow Senate cabinet and the Executive officers in tackling goals for next year. I understand the importance of all of our roles in making sure that all of the needs of the student body are addressed.",Left-Leaning/Centrist,"Excellent- I think that the A.S. Senate did a great job in tending to the needs of the student body and emphasizing their role as a support system to the campus. Many unplanned events happened this year that definitely affected the campus, but the way that they handled the situations were fair and objective.","At this time, I believe the information that I know about the movement is insufficient in making a proper and informed stance. Before solidifying anything, I would want to do my own research, speak with the administration, and proponents/opponents to divestment. I recognize, however, that UCSB has a very different culture than the other UC campuses that have passed resolutions regarding the movement and whatever stance that I come to should be mindful of our community. ","In a perfect world, I do believe higher education should be tuition-free. The University of California system was founded on the basis that they would be a public institution that was free and accessible to everyone who lived in California. However, with education now linked with government and the economy, it has not become the case. I do believe UCSB should be tuition-free because financial burdens are a huge issue for students today debating if they want to pursue higher education. That should not be the case.","There are a lot of mental health services available to the student body such as CAPS and the SMHCS. They offer great resources for those who are struggling with a spectrum of problems, ranging from small to large ones. I have personally not used the mental health services here, but I think it is a vital and essential part of the campus. It is reassuring to know that if any problems should occur within my life, there is a dedicated center to help me. However, with any resource on campus, there are many areas in which we can improve upon, especially in regards to mental health resources.

On one part, I believe that a particular reason why people do not reach out and utilize these resources is because of the stigma of mental health. As an Asian-American, a large part of my upbringing was concealing my emotions and learning that my emotions were considered a “taboo”. It wasn’t until college where proper education allowed me to self-destigmatize this preconceived notion. 

This is an area in which I believe the mental health services can be improved upon. Many people oftentimes have the same beliefs as I did and therefore do not consider CAPS and other resources an option. De-stigmatization of mental health and leading healthy conversations is an essential part of overcoming an issue. More advocacy and more education about the normality of these things can be done. More private options can also be made available for those who are uncomfortable with being seen using these resources in public. This goes back to the whole notion how people still view mental health as a taboo. 
","This situation was a very complex and sensitive subject that required a lot of careful investigation, which was in part why many believed the response to be slow. It was a very serious matter that had to be dealt firmly, which subsequently was why the Interfraternity Council placed all the fraternities under social moratorium for the remainder of the quarter. It serves as an important reminder that change must be made with these organizations that place their traditions and systems on archaic routines.

One way that they could have handled the situation better is being more transparent about the whole process. I do believe that quicker action must have been dealt with time-sensitive matters such as these. I am not sure if the administration gave sufficient support and resources to the survivor, but this is an area that can be clarified and refined. The administration should stand and protect survivors in their journey to healing. With the administration, I felt as if they sent out the emails outlining the reports but no later actions were made clear. However, we need to know what the victim wanted as it's a sensitive issue and the university can’t take any action without the approval of the survivor. Although the university did not act as harshly and as explicitly as the people would have wanted, the Interfraternity council took actions and precautions that they deemed necessary in the situation. These new regulations were made in collaboration with OSL. 
","Title IX has encouraged great progress within our society but leaves some things left in question. Although I am not completely knowledgeable with all of the special cases of Title IX, one of the main issues that people see is that it uses terms such as “sex” instead of “gender”. This has allowed the federal government to interpret the Act, sometimes differently. I am not too sure, but I believe Title IX does not provide complete and total protection for some groups, especially within the LGTBQ+ community. Those who identify as trasngender, intersex, or non-binary may not be guaranteed total protection and is up to the discretion of the school. I may be wrong, but I believe this area is lacking through my research.

Another area that Title IX fails to do in terms of addressing sexual assault is that it does not support and protect the survivor enough. Under Betsy Devos, she definitely puts a lot more emphasis on protecting the accused rather than using her power to defend for the survivor. Especially during this era where so many of those accused of sexual assault are able to walk away with minimal punishments, action must be taken. Those who are survivors of sexual assault must feel secured and backed by the legislation of Title IX.
","As a member of the Asian-American and the LGBTQ+ communities, I think that UCSB has done well in solidifying our visibility and protecting our identities. Disregarding administration actions, the entirety of the campus is overwhelmingly supportive of these minority groups and generally recognize that efforts should be made in providing resources to these underrepresented groups. UCSB really emphasizes the importance of community to the student body which has done many wonderful things in uniting our campus.The Student Resource Building and the Multi-Cultural Center provide many great resources and events for our minority groups and have safe spaces that are dedicated to us, whether it be learning about a different culture or learning about our own.

With any institution, improvements can always be made. An area that UCSB could improve upon however is the creation of more safe spaces on campus, and more advocacy to utilize these resources. Not enough publitization is done for these useful services and should be made more clear to students that they are here. The Asian-American population has a dedicated Asian Resource Center within the SRB which doubles as a safe space. I’m not too familiar with how many people utilize this space, but I know that for those who are not involved in any cultural organization, their participation is low. We need to target these demographics where they may not be a part of any organization, and thus feel not able to utilize these spaces as well. 
","If I am elected to serve in the Senate, one of the first bills that I would like to pass is a bill that initiates a donation center within Isla Vista. This would be in conjunction with the other initiative to bring a Food Bank to Isla Vista as well. Food waste is a large issue within any college town, and organizations such as the IV Compost Collective can only do so much. By allowing donations of non-perishable foods and other supplies that students in need can benefit from, this will not only help with cutting down our food waste but also help combat the issue of food insecurity. While spending my time living in Isla Vista, I’ve also noticed that there is a large homeless population. With this donation center, I would hope to make this accessible to the less fortunate because they are a part of our community. More information about this platform can be seen in Question 4.","As a senator I would advocate for more open forums and meetings with students. I think it is incredibly important to recognize and validate everyone’s opinion because many matters directly affect the student body and certain groups. Again, I think that areas that I would improve upon are the visibility of the events. Not many people know when or if there are events that allow student discourse about certain matters. Although the A.S. The Senate has a good spectrum of different groups here on campus, inevitably there will be some groups that will not be represented, and it is important to have their voices heard.

I would publicize and make meetings more accessible for all students on campus. We need to utilize the platforms that we have such as the A.S. facebook page or instagram. Encouraging people to follow these platforms is the first step in making people aware of the events that the Associated Students hold. Another thing that I would work to do is to hold educational events that will help give students information to make informed stances about certain matters. Of course, I would also look and discuss with other student governments from other schools and see what their procedures are to involve their student body. It is good to draw from inspirations where other school governments have large student action. No student government will be perfect, but we can take the necessary actions to be the best version that we can be. 
","What the next UC President should prioritize in securing a holistic system that protects and does not exploit the undergraduate, graduate, and staff bodies. The relationships and interplay between these three groups are very delicate and interwoven. Any subsequent mistreatment or negligence to one body, affects the other two substantially. As we can see from the COLA strikes that gained momentum across the UC campuses, the graduate students went on strike for fairer wages. This led to undergraduate and staff being affected directly. Areas that also should be focused are the support of first-generation students and marginalized groups that need the security. Many of these groups do not have the same resources when applying into college/are in college compared to those who identify with higher classes. They are oftentimes dealt with extraneous circumstances that inhibit their full potentials. By prioritizing these groups, the UC system can undoubtedly be elevated. Another priority that should be looked at is dedicating a mental health task force.",,,,,,,
Kaitlyn Medland,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaitlyn-Medland-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,2nd ,Political Science and History of Public Policy and Law Double Major ,,,"Being involved in our student community through various forms of student government has led me to run to be an off-campus senator with the 71st senate. Encountering students who are passionate about and motivated to create programs and entities to represent the entire student body was the greatest factor when I was considering running. I want to create and enact these programs that uplift all students. I will ensure that I do this through collaborating with the students I currently know, and the students I will reach out to. Our students have demands, and these demands deserve to be listened to, asked about, and understood by our senate. I ensure this will happen if I am a senator, and in turn, the entirety of AS will be more inclusive of student opinions and become a greater resource for students. There exists a multitude of ways in which Associated Students can be a greater asset to UCSB students; I intend to use the resources AS retains to ensure that students are well represented.","Campus involvement, particularly being a student leader, has been a priority for me since my freshman year. I have a strong desire to work with students to create a better community in which we are all accounted for, accepted, and aided. In my first year, I was elected to be president of San Miguel Hall in which I led weekly meetings to fund and organize programs within our residence hall, along with serving as a liaison to the Residential Housing Association in which I represented San Miguel and helped organize All Hall events. This opportunity greatly enhanced my skills in communication, organization, and leadership. I met weekly with students and professional staff to ensure I was carrying out my duties in a way that represented all of San Miguel. If elected to the 71st senate, I am positive these attributes will aid me in being the best senator I can be. In my second year, I have served as the Fund the UC Campaign Coordinator in the EVPSA office and as the vice president of a new club, PERIOD chapter. As the FTUC Coordinator, I have worked in promoting legislation such as Prop 13 and the Summer Cal Grant, to enhance our schools and increase affordability of higher education. I have also traveled to other UC’s to meet with other FTUC coordinators in order to conduct greater outreach. In this position, I have become more confident in reviewing and understanding state legislation which will be an asset to my work if I am elected to be a senator. As vice president of PERIOD chapter, I have listened to student demands for free menstrual products through creating an organization that serves to eliminate period poverty and menstrual stigma. In this position, I have worked with campus staff and AS entities to secure funding and locations to place these menstrual products to be accessible to students. These experiences with collaborative effort and steadfastness will make me a great senator as I understand the process of student, facility, and AS collaboration that is necessary to establish change on our campus.","IV Food Bank: In collaboration with other senators, the current food bank, and the Food Security and Basic Needs Task Fforce, I would author a bill to establish an IV Food Bank. As for the logistics of location, I would need to meet with the IVCSD and Goleta county officials. This food bank would operate on the same system as the UCen food bank in which students swipe in with their access card and can pick out donated food items and toiletries. This food bank would offer more employment opportunities to students, along with increasing food security for students living in IV as this food bank would ideally be open on the weekends. 

Resolution to support the creation of a gender neutral restroom in every building on campus: Many of our on campus buildings do not have gender neutral restrooms, which negatively impacts many of our students. In each building where it is applicable, this resolution would support the creation of a gender-neutral restroom. 


Resolution to support the allowance of an excused personal day per quarter: In many of our on-campus jobs and mandatory class meetings, students are not allowed a personal, sick, or mental health day without a documented doctor’s visit and note. If we do not provide this documentation, we are at risk of being fired from our jobs or lose points from our grade in classes. This places students without health insurance, or transportation to a medical facility, in a precarious situation. They ultimately take on the risk of termination or a bad grade if they fall sick or become overwhelmed, requiring a personal day. In this resolution, I would partner with the Commission on Student Wellbeing and other senators, to support the establishment of an excused personal day across all campus jobs and class meetings. This excused personal day, as of now, would be allotted once per quarter. However, this may change upon meeting with other students, the Academic Senate, staff, and faculty. There would not be required documentation for this personal day, employers nor faculty could ask for the reason as to why a student needs the personal day so as not to encroach on their personal lives. There cannot exist any repercussions for the taking of a personal day. This resolution would greatly benefit the wellbeing of all students. ","The primary goals of my platform, and what I hope to achieve in office, is the expansion of resources to Isla Vista and enhancing the wellbeing of our students and in turn, our community. To expand resources to IV, I hope to work with AS executive offices, other senators, and AS entities. I hope to provide free menstrual products across campus and in IV spaces operated by AS such as Pardall Center. To achieve this, I will work with the organization I am vice president of, PERIOD Chapter, and the AS Womxn’s Commission to attain funding and student aid in constructing this program. I also hope to enhance study space in Pardall Center and the IV Community Center through providing more charging ports and comfortable seating. To achieve this, I will work with other senators and these locations to enhance these spaces to provide more study locations for students living in IV. I also hope to work with the current food bank along with the food security and basic needs taskforce to establish an IV food bank that is open on the weekends.

As for wellbeing, I hope to focus on the health of students and the Isla Vista environment through working with AS and local government entities. In collaboration with the Mental Health Task Force, I hope to propose funding requests to local government officials, such as Joan Hartmann, that would fund free mental health counseling at Acacia in IV. This would aid students in acquiring free mental health services outside the long wait times at CAPS. I would also make student health a priority through working the IV Tenants Union and AS Lobby Corps in pressuring landlords and homeowners to enhance IV housing and routinely test for mold. This would protect the health of our students living in IV and promote student understanding of the demands we can make to our landlords. Enhancing the cleanliness of IV streets is the last portion of my platform. To achieve this, I hope to establish IV recycling centers in which IV residents can donate their cans, glass, and bottles to receive money back. For this program, I hope to work with Goleta county officials, the Environmental Affairs Board, and the Zero Waste Committee. This program would aid in cleaning up waste on our streets and paying our students for doing so. Another program to clean IV streets I hope to implement is employing homeless or unemployed individuals in IV and Goleta county to pick up trash at least once a week. IV, due to the density, cannot have street sweepers barrel through. This program would enhance the cleanliness of our streets and aid in the financial security of our community. To achieve this, I hope to work with Goleta county officials, the IV Community Services District, and the Isla Vista Community Relations Committee. 
","This is stated above as listed with each of my individual goals. However I will list each entity I plan to work with here. This is not a complete list as I hope to collaborate with as many organizations as possible to make sure each policy and program I draft is inclusive of the entire student body. This list, if I am elected to be senator, will be expanded as I conduct more outreach and learn of more student groups. The list is as follows: AS Senate, AS Executive Offices, AS Advisors, PERIOD Chapter, AS Womxn’s Commission, Pardall Center, IV Community Center, Food Bank, Mental Health Task Force, local government officials such as Joan Hartmann, IVTU, Lobby Corps, Goleta County, Environmental Affairs Board, Zero Waste Committee, IVCSD, and the IVCRC.","If we are unable to hold in person office hours and meetings, I will ensure that I am as accessible as possible through email, social media, and zoom. On my senator Facebook profile, I will make weekly posts detailing my contact information and zoom access for office hours or private meetings. These posts would be made the day before I plan to hold office hours so as to allow time for students to schedule the time they wish to meet or email me with any questions or concerns. As for zoom, I would be logged on during my scheduled office hours and students could join and leave at any point during that time slot. I would also create anonymous google forms, posted to my social media profiles, asking students to submit their comments or concerns. These anonymous forms would also be used to gauge student reaction to events happening within our campus community. For example, I would have created one in reaction to Chancellor Yang’s abrupt decision to tell students to go home, and not return to campus, given the Coronavirus pandemic. These responses then would have been used as student testimony in meetings and communications with the Chancellor on the hardships that decision created for many students, and how those hardships should be resolved by the university. In turn, even if I were to be on campus, or home in San Diego, I would ensure that I am serving UCSB students and remaining open to work for them.","I believe I am the best candidate for off-campus senator as I have worked to enhance our student community for the past two years. I have worked with students from various organizations and of differing beliefs on and off campus to enhance the UCSB experience for ALL students. I will ensure that I am listening to and reaching out to students with different perspectives in order to construct my votes, resolutions, and bills in complete support of the entire student body. I will stay true to my belief in uplifting students in need. I will provide outlets for students to engage with AS that allows for true inclusion, rather than me simply acting as my own voice, speaking on my beliefs. I understand that the purpose of being an off-campus senator is to speak for the students living in IV. But, I do not wish to impose my views on IV students, Instead, I will ensure I am engaging with the IV community and listening to their demands to shape how I will act as a senator. I will listen, I will work hard, I will complete all tasks on time, and most importantly I will serve. I refuse to act on my own interests. If elected, I will act on the interests of my constituents to create a community that is inclusive of all and provides an enhanced experience at UCSB.","I am left-leaning in politics at all levels. I align with the democratic platform and, in particular, more liberal beliefs. Despite my political beliefs, I will always listen and converse with students to create policies on our campus that are inclusive of all students.","Overall, I personally believe this year’s senate did a very good job of addressing the needs of the student body. Particularly, through the amendment proposed by Senators Ferguson and Swanson to incorporate two senate seats for international students; I believe this is one of the most important and excellent acts of this year’s Senate. However, to be considered excellent, the 71st AS Senate must create greater communication between students and AS to truly understand and act on the needs of the entire student body.","As I am not a member of the Israeli or Palestinian nations or communities, I am not equipped to answer whether or not I would vote in favor of the divestment resolution. Instead, I have already begun to reach out to UCSB students to understand their perspective on divestment; this is educating me on the debate along with allowing me to understand how various students feel. If elected, I would continue this outreach and come to a conclusion on my vote at that time.","With the ample amount of provided services and resources, I understand that UCSB cannot be tuition-free. However, I do believe our tuition should be lowered to ease the financial burden on our students and their families. Most students encounter financial stress for various reasons and this places a strain on their academics. In my opinion, there is an immense waste with the handling of our tuition and fees. This waste ultimately makes higher education inaccessible for a large proportion of young adults, whether their families are considered low-income or middle class. Financial stress should not plague students seeking higher education.","The mental health services at UCSB are greatly insufficient. When students are forced to wait two weeks for an appointment with our CAPS office or turned down for immediate counseling, our mental health services are failing us. To counteract this, we need to continue the work of the Mental Health Task Force as they are in collaboration with the current AS President Alison Sir. The Task Force has done well in promoting on-campus mental health resources outside of CAPS. This awareness must be increased through postings around campus, push emails, and social media outreach to ensure that all students know the multitude of mental health resources we have access to. 

We also need to provide increased mental health awareness programs throughout the WHOLE quarter, rather than strictly emphasizing the importance of mental health during finals week. Although we do need these measures during finals week, they are lacking throughout the first ten weeks. Our mental health should be made a priority by the administration, our faculty, our jobs, and our student government. To ensure this, I hope to work with other Senate members and executive offices to pressure the administration to allow us mental health relief days each quarter, in which we are excused from work or class if need be to receive counseling or to relax and conduct self-care for the day. These days would not require a doctor’s note so as to relieve worries of having medical insurance. I believe these relief days would greatly benefit our students. 
","Although I understand the University took time to draft a proper response and conduct a thorough investigation, their radio silence regarding the sexual assault allegations was deafening. The anger and frustration students possessed at the university’s minimal response caused many students to discredit the university’s power to protect all students, and in particular, sexual assault victims. To address the situation, and to protect all of our students, the university should have suspended activities of the alleged fraternity after the FIRST sexual assault of the quarter was reported, rather than placing control of the situation in the hands of the IFC. This may seem harsh, but this may have prevented the assault of other students. This would have indicated the severity of the allegation and the means to which the university would support sexual assault victims on our campus. Although the fraternity houses are not campus property, our students occupy these houses whether as residents or guests. Even in Isla Vista, our safety should be the university’s priority. The university failed to protect us through their slow response to these horrid events.","Title IX is not an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Under this system, the perpetrator is endowed with more protections than the victim is. This is particularly evident on our own campus, given the events in Fall of 2019 when the university neglected to inform the student body of the sexual assault on fraternity property in a timely manner. Through this, the university was protecting the members of that fraternity despite the horrid allegations made. Our students were thus still interacting with dangerous persons, due to UCSB abiding by Title IX regulations on investigations into sexual assault allegations. The reform of this system is under state discretion. However, I would work with the EVPSA executive office to engage with legislation regarding Title IX and pressure our campus administration, along with all the UC’s, to propose reforms to this system to properly address sexual assault on our campuses. Through the voice and power of all UC administrations, and particularly the UC Student Association which is a team of the UC external vice presidents and their core team, we can allow for our demands to change Title IX, and to protect victims of sexual assault, to be enacted.","I believe that students aligning with these historically underrepresented groups are those who are effectively crafting and serving their own communities, not necessarily just UCSB’s faculty or advisors. While AS has successfully established incorporated entities to serve these communities, the students are the ones who have tirelessly fought to be included and maintain the space they deserve on our campus. In the past few years and even since my time on this campus, I believe UCSB has made significant strides in incorporating these underrepresented groups. However, I argue that UCSB could be more proactive in the inclusion of underrepresented groups. There needs to exist greater outreach from the UCSB administration and Associated Students to underrepresented groups through their organizations, for example, BSU, Hermanxs, and Queer Student Union. These groups should not have to solely rely on their efforts to be represented on campus, but rather they should be uplifted, primarily by Associated Students.","If elected to serve on the 71st AS Senate, the first bill I plan to author will be to support the opening of an Isla Vista food bank. Food insecurity plagues a significant portion of our students; many UCSB students do not know if they will be able to supply their next meal. Although I believe the UCen food bank has greatly aided our students, a food bank in IV, that is also open on the weekends, would enhance food security amongst our student population. This proposed food bank would operate on the same system as that in the UCen; students would check other students in with our access cards, permitting them to grab the available food items. This measure would thus provide another employment opportunity for students and supply students with greater accessibility to healthy food throughout the entire week. Through establishing a food bank in IV, we would be aiding financial and food security amongst our student population residing off-campus.","The current operation of accessibility to our AS elected positions is insufficient. Office hours are published once, maybe twice a quarter, and students rarely visit these outreach hours due to class, work, or personal conflicts. Town halls work well to allow students a forum to express concerns on various issues, but they are rarely sufficiently advertised or attended. The greatest conflict in accessibility is the lack of knowledge regarding AS. The majority of students I’ve spoken with about my current position in the EVPSA office have little to no knowledge about AS. To counteract this, and teach our student population about AS, its services, and actions, I propose a greater social media presence and weekly email updates. All AS offices and members should be required to provide weekly updates on their AS social media accounts about projects they are working on and how students can critique or become involved with the project. I propose these updates also be sent out through email to notify the entire student body of the work each AS entity is conducting. This will also benefit the entire AS body by holding us accountable.","The next UC President must value students higher than profit. They must listen to and consider faculty, student, and worker demands. After all, a leader is only as great as their ability to listen to the people they serve. This is something that Janet Napolitano lacks, and in turn has received intense backlash from across the UC campuses. In the next UC President, I believe the top attributes I am searching for is compassion, professionalism, and adaptability. Compassion to listen to demands within the UC system, professionalism when handling crises, and adaptability to changing standards amongst faculty, students, and workers. We must not continue to accept a UC President that disregards our opinions and implements policies that are detrimental to our campuses. The next UC President must understand the varying backgrounds of those who occupy the UC system and ensure they are all accounted for and accommodated.",,,,,,,
Dylan Martinez,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dylan-Martinez-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,he/him/his,3rd,Environmental Studies ,,,"The 2020s are off to an unbelievable start, and while nobody anticipated this is the place we’d be at three months ago, I’m a glass-half-full kinda guy. Before this pandemic and the life changes that came with it, I thought I was running to give back to a community I loved deeply, and to combat our self-perpetuating cycle of apathy towards student government. While that’s still true, I believe this year will be especially crucial in addressing glaring weaknesses across our campus and society exposed by the pandemic. We have to remember that students are this campus, and though our collective power is underutilized, it can be fierce and formidable. Nobody remembers that UCSB’s collective voice was once so potent that Storke Plaza was intentionally sunk into the ground to control our protests, and then-Governor Reagan sent in the National Guard to calm us down. I’m not advocating that level of discontent, but we need to reinvigorate that level of energy and channel it for positive, genuine change. We’re multitaskers at heart, and there’s no reason we can’t fix obvious problems with our campus (lack of menstrual products in all bathrooms) while simultaneously rallying thousands of Gauchos to lobby for substantial structural change (significant reduction and elimination of tuition). If there ever is a time for apathy and cynicism, it’s certainly not now. I’m running to make AS work for everybody – students, sanitation workers, TAs, faculty, food hall workers, underrepresented groups, faculty. Everybody, no catch. AS doesn’t need to be a phantom organization that only crosses your mind once a year in the spring – it can, and should, be engaging with our community throughout the year to make everybody’s lives easier.","I previously served in the Creative Media Unit of AS as one of two marketing directors, and as Service Chair with Phi Sigma Pi honors fraternity; am currently serving as the Director of Student Life with the Office of the Student Advocate and as marketing director with UCSB Adventure Programs. Particularly going through the leadership training course and leading subsequent trips outdoors has developed my leadership skills in tough situations. Logistics, planning, and foresight are paramount on those trips, as well as adaptability when things fall apart. That level of flexibility is something I anticipate will be a strength as a senator, where teamwork and give-and-take are the name of the game. As service chair, I had the opportunity to meet leaders across our Goleta and SB communities, organizing short and long-term service projects. I love working with people and learning about the ways people are already taking charge to better IV and the surrounding area. As Director of Student Life with the OSA, I’ve learned about all the resources at the disposal of students in judicial trouble, and how to best protect their interests. Being part of this community the last 3 years has been a gift, and I want to return the favor.","The number one issue facing our society is climate change. As such, I’d present a bill establishing a natural disaster relief fund to assist at-need students. In the three years I’ve been at UCSB, we’ve experienced two wildfire disasters, mudslides, and cliff erosion. I lived on DP last year, and the houses on either side of us both had their backyards collapse. Neither units are rented out now. We need to get ahead of this issue and proactively retreat from the coast before we see serious repercussions. This fund would facilitate relocating disadvantaged students, preparing for the next fires and eventual “Big One” earthquake, and stockpiling resources so that our campus isn’t completely paralyzed when disaster strikes. On a smaller scale, another bill I’d present would direct the allocation of funds to add outlets to all floors and study spaces of the library. This is a small upgrade that would go a long way – we’re a digital campus where a laptop is all but required, and students should always have access to charging the devices they need to do schoolwork. Beyond traditional schoolwork, however, I would push to bring back UCSB’s “living classes” – back in the 1990s, our campus used to offer classes in bartending and home-ec. For whatever reason, these were eliminated, and I would author a resolution lobbying for their return, in subjects such as graphic design, financial literacy, and bartending. In our 21st century skills economy, it’s not just about what you learn in the classroom, but what technical skills you have. It’s important we prepare ourselves as best we can for the job market, including in ways you might not find in a traditional class.","In recognition of existing bureaucracy and hoops to jump through, my platform is centered on goals realistically achievable within a calendar year. Namely: requiring free menstrual products throughout campus, adding outlets to all study spaces of the library, preventing waitlisted units from counting towards your pass time total, and establishing a more efficient meal-swipe system. These are small but important changes I believe can be made in a term. I also hope to engage diverse groups of Gauchos in the process to reach loftier goals: the establishment of a natural disaster relief fund; creating a fund to allow financially disadvantaged students to participate in extracurriculars they might not otherwise be able to afford; and substantially reducing (if not outright eliminating) the cost of student healthcare. This job is self-directed and self-motivated. Once election season is over, I will make myself as visible as possible and reach out to groups typically left out of the conversation. I’ll show up to meetings for random orgs to find out what their needs are and let them know they have a direct connection into AS. I want to be a face that doesn’t disappear after election season, that different orgs and groups get to know over the course of my term, and who’s on the ground engaging with the people who need it most. I’ll push hard to put my ideas into practice, meeting people where they are, and pressuring our administration as much as possible to get it done. ","I want to work with UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force to build on their work in destigmatizing mental health issues and promoting resources we have in place, such as our Alcohol & Drug Programs and Health and Wellness Center. We can also do more for our underrepresented communities by holding smaller, more intimate town halls with university administrators so that their needs are directly heard, and better understood by the people at the top. This includes partnering with orgs like the RCSGD, Pan Asian Network, the AdCRC, Black Student Engagement Program, and WGSE, to name a few. I also want to partner with our Design, Facilities, & Safety Services unit to lobby and secure funding to make desperately needed upgrades to our campus. While it’s wonderful we have the $50 million Henley Hall going up on campus, and the “Classroom Building Project” sprouting up soon between the Library and Psych building, we also have students crammed into triples in most of our dorms, and an overall housing shortage in IV. Our 2010 Long Range Development Plan calls for new freshman doors, as well as an overall increase in housing capacity, so it’s my priority to lobby for donations and grants to be able to put our students first and increase UCSB’s housing capabilities.","I will hold office hours over Zoom and be available over Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for anyone who needs to talk. If org groups across campus also decided to hold meetings on Zoom, I’d ask to attend to get the best understanding possible of what their needs and concerns are. I would also push for virtual town halls on a wide range of issues, including building on the first mental health town hall we had last quarter. We could even utilize resources like Slack and Discord to continue community organizing in the most effective way possible while not being in person. We can still work for and improve Isla Vista remotely, so I’d try to use social media for the greatest good possible – polls, stimulating discussion and engagement in comments, reaching out to organizations directly, sharing resources, and posting stuff that makes people smile. We’re all in this together, and if we’re still stuck inside by the time fall rolls around, it’s our job as student leaders to keep our community united and looking on the bright side of things.","I’m graduating next year. I’m not putting my hat into the ring as a stepping stone to my next AS job, or as a resume builder, or because I find this fun. I’m doing this because I’ve been on this campus three years, loving every second of it while also recognizing deeply-ingrained flaws in our culture, administration, and way of operation. These problems are by no means specific to UCSB, but I genuinely believe this is a unique group of people we have in Isla Vista and on campus – a work hard, play hard hybrid community with a distinctive culture that is definitively ours . I want to lead the way in establishing ourselves as a national model for what university done right looks like. I have ideas that I want to implement, goals to set for our entire campus, and I believe I can engage in a cross-demographic and cross-cultural style effectively and consistently. I’m part of the Latinx and LGBT communities here, while also being part of the outdoors community; as I’ve gone through my Chinese minor, I’ve come to know many amazing international students, and also had experience with AS and our professional fraternities. I want to leave this place better than I found it, and I know I have the motivation, experience, and strategy to get actual things done – and that’s the ultimate theme of this campaign. I don’t want anyone to look back on my time as a senator and say, “Who was that? What the hell did he do?” I’m not at all saying I want my name on everything – just that my time will be spent in the offices of people who can do what I can’t alone, with organizations whose needs have been overlooked, and reaching out directly to people left out of the process. No flashy, ostentatious resolutions on Donald Trump or Israel; my focus will be squarely on this community and how we can move it forward. I love people and this school, and that’s why I’m running for this position.","(A) Left-leaning, but I’m non-ideological; I prefer to look at issues holistically and separately.","(B) Very good; adding international student senate seats was a huge step forward in recognizing the contributions and presence of our international student community. They passed responsive resolutions to pesticide, support for the COLA movement, and ushered in a significantly more cooperative environment. We have a strong foundation to build upon.","Yes; this is a complicated issue, all facets of which cannot possibly be addressed in 100 words, but I will always vote to defend human rights, no matter the regime and no matter the implications, including within our own country.","Yes; the University of California was founded on this premise. Higher education should not lie on the other side of a high financial barrier that only some families can surmount. Everybody should be able to better themselves, regardless of their financial situation, and money is a colossal and highly unnecessary headache for families. I am in favor of all UCs and Cal States being tuition free. ","No, and through no fault of the amazing staff we currently have working at CAPS, our Student Mental Health Coordinators, etc. Our mental health support apparatus is chronically underfunded. Long-term therapy sessions is an immediate necessity, along with strengthening our Mental Health Peers and School Anxiety programs. Securing the funds to add just a few more psychologists could get that many more people in to get the help they need. However, we need to increase awareness of the wide array of mental health support programs we already have in place, such as C.A.R.E., the Student Mental Health Coordination office, Health & Wellness Center, and Career Services, to name a few. Of course, situations vary and some students may find better support tailored to their unique experiences with orgs like the RCSGD or Veterans Resource Team. To get that help, they need to know these support systems exist, so one of my top priorities is increasing outreach. Mental health problems can be debilitating and may feel shameful to bring up, so the onus is on us to make these programs as easily accessible as humanly possible. Because some issues are so crippling, as with the flu or cold, students should be permitted to use mental health days without penalty when attending class is simply too much. As a campus, we need to destigmatize mental health issues and prioritize fully funding the programs that make the greatest impact. The infrastructure already exists!","Sexual assaults at fraternity houses is not a new development. The university must do better and demonstrate the level of seriousness these cases require. Pushing defense strategies, while important, should not be the focus of any comprehensive response to this systemic issue. The university needs to be addressing the root issues at play here, and supporting survivors should be their foremost priority. In handling the Fall 2019 cases specifically, the university should have released the names of the fraternities under investigation so that students can make their own decisions about who and what organizations they want to affiliate with. Thoroughness is paramount, but transparency at each step of the process is of equal importance, and we didn’t see that from the actions the administration took.","The system as it stands has some serious flaws and obviously varies case by case, but currently errs on the side of the accused rather than the survivor. The system is better than nothing, but that’s not good enough. Crucially, the university does not follow up if a student doesn’t respond following their immediate complaint, and I do believe they should investigate further in this case. Following an assault, a survivor’s state of mind can range widely, and if there is insufficient information, it’s the university’s duty to follow up themselves. It is the university that sets the tone and timeline, and “not enough information” is a weak response – go get the information. Don’t claim to be doing all you can to prevent rape culture when you verifiably are not. They are the principal authoritative body that can do this, and not doing such is a failing of shameful proportions.","There is always work to do in improving student life for minority groups, and today there exists a wide array of resources for students. As a society, there’s still a lot of work we have to do. I believe our school culture is changing for the better, and that stems from student leaders who take initiative. The UCSB community is moving in the right direction and making great strides toward more equitable representation, a greater understanding of different cultures, and a united sense of community","I will author a bill that seeks to create a natural disaster relief fund. Del Playa is an at-risk stretch of land that landlords will continue to rent out, even as bluffs retreat at 2-14 inches per year (varying address to address). We should proactively create a fund to help students who find themselves forced to relocate mid-year, working hand in hand with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and as well as advocate for the proactive demolition of especially dangerous properties. An organized retreat from the coast is necessary, and would save lives.","I will be visible not just during the campaign season, but throughout my entire term and seek out individual student voices. Whether that’s showing up to different org’s events or chatting with people in the library, my goal is proactivity. Cynicism about AS runs pretty deep, so the onus is on senators to identify problems, energize our community to act collectively, and urge people to use the agency they have to affect change. If we can make change that’s visible, and that directly engages the concerns of diverse groups of students, we can create a student government that actually gives us a seat at the table, rather than the image of an elite group of resume-builders.","The leader of the University of California should not be an entrenched politician, should not be someone who’s going to mislead us on where our money is going, and who will not fire TAs who are asking for a living wage. We need somebody who’s been in the classroom and whose focus is education and societal advancement, not the advancement of their career. It is crucial that the next UC president is close to the issues that matter to students, TAs, and faculty. Their top priority should be compensating our graduate students fairly, expanding university housing, and operating transparently.",,,,,,,
Bruce Fan,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bruce-Fan-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,1st ,Economics ,,,"I am running to be an off-campus senator with the 71st senate because of my passion for serving the UCSB community and voice for student groups that are previously underheard. It is always my dream to participate in the decision-making process at my university, and it is genuinely a self-rewarding experience by witnessing the improvement of my campus through my efforts. I also recognize the changes and impacts one can make as a leader from my past leadership experience at high school. As a student from China, I realize that the large-portion presence of international students does not always indicate a corresponding representation in our student government. Furthermore, I believe that my unique experience and background allow me to act as a bridge between various and distinct cultures and peoples and communicate their respective concerns and needs. By running for senator, I recognize the rising challenges that impose in front of me, but I believe that such courage is necessary to facilitate positive changes and transform the community to become ever diverse and tolerant. International students need someone to address their concerns and fight for their interests, and UCSB needs someone who has a certain degree of understanding of both domestic and international issues. For these reasons, I am running to be the next off-campus senator with my visions and plans in hopes of a more academic-friendly, safer, and more convenient campus.","As a Student Representative at Large in the Internal Affairs Committee, although my term has not officially begun, I have done important things that make our campus better. In February, even before Covid-19 had attracted serious attention in the United States, I had decided to address certain students’ concerns regarding the transparency of the situation and potential preventing measures to the Chancellor’s office. I still remember that friendly conversation with Ms. O’Brien, and I was glad to see her taking notes on our concerns and Student Health making an announcement that afternoon. It was the first time I took the step to send a message and seek responses, which succeeded, in my opinion. I decided to take a shot thanks to my international friends from China, and they knew that the situation was grave from their families and friends. In addition, I have led the process of writing joint letters and petitions to UCSB with international students to de-triple dorms and maximize social distancing. Besides these moves, I also actively participate in forums related to criminal justice reform and events hosted by various culture clubs such as CSSA. I have also visited much rental housing in IV and examined their conditions carefully since I have some friends who live there, and I feel their suggestions, along with my observation, can be excellent references for students who choose to live in IV. Such experiences all contribute to making me a qualified senator as I am more informed about various issues inside and outside the campus and have the skills to make changes.","The first bill is an Emergency Act that prepares funds and deals with issues including academic wellbeing, safety, housing, and dining under emergencies such as pandemics. Academically, the bill will cover courses, workloads, remote instruction procedures, and other aspects. It will inform the students in advance about the cancellation and addition of courses in response to emergencies, as well as guarantee the education quality by detailing online instruction processes and requirements (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous, course length, etc.). For safety concerns, the bill aims to implement emergency measures swiftly, such as providing masks and other protective equipment and relocating students to designated and separate dorms. For dining commons, the bill will set meal plans during special times for students living on campus and ensure that the staff is wearing masks and gloves. UCSB had responded to the above issues during Covid-19, but not on time and mainly still in an experiment to see what works and what does not. I believe after this time, we should be working on creating a systematic mechanism that deals specifically with these problems and making sure that next time we will not panic. The second resolution I will introduce is a comprehensive academic advising program that is exclusively dedicated to international students and students with English as an acquired language to check and revise their essays, resumes, and other writings. The current CLAS, in many students’ opinions, is not effectively helping the students I mentioned. Thus, the program is like a CLAS but specializes in mitigating the problems that some students face. I am also willing to participate in the program as an adviser. The third resolution would be a guidebook that guides students through Isla Vista house rentals. According to my knowledge, my students have been “tricked” by their landlords. For Instance, the landlords falsely accused students of damaging their properties. Thus, the guidebook can suggest that students should take pictures prior to moving in to make sure they have evidence. The example I mentioned is only one facet of the problems that students encounter, and the guidebook aims to combat such issues thoroughly.","My platform focuses mainly on academic wellbeing, safety, and convenience. Therefore, I would work with the Academic Senate, OISS, Public Safety Commission, A.S. Food Bank, IV Tenants Union, and other student bodies to achieve my goals while in office. Meanwhile, it is also essential to communicate with my constituents and other students.",See Above,"I will be holding online office hours every week to ensure thorough communications with students and my constituents. Students can contact me via Zoom, Messenger, Facebook, Instagram, and Wechat. I will also post updates and information on my FB page and Instagram. For international students, I also expect frequent communications via Wechat.","I am the best candidate for this position because of my leadership experience and unique background, which makes me a bridge that connects different student groups and serves them, respectively. Compared to other typical candidates, I am more likely to view and approach problems from various angles and better address the needs of particular students. Since I have experienced both Western and Eastern cultures, I believe I can make UCSB more diverse, harmonious, and globally influential.",(a) Left-leaning,"(c) Good. Although it is my first year at UCSB, I can still feel that the 70th A.S. Senate is doing well in addressing the needs of the student body. I am very glad that the A.S. Senate has passed the bill which aims to create two senate seats for international students. While still awaiting the final vote from UCSB students, this bill is a significant step towards a more diverse and global UCSB community.
","At this point, I have to admit that I currently hold no definite stance on BDS as I realize that dealing with such controversial topics requires professional knowledge on religions and cultures and experiences that are far beyond my reach. All I want to say is that we should always be respectful to each other and have productive conversations. I would need to gain a deeper understanding of this topic after discussing with my constituents and other professionals to make a fitting decision.","(b) No. Economically, it is quite impossible for a public university system like the UC to be tuition-free, but I believe that lowering the cost is feasible and necessary. I will be a strong advocate for alleviating financial burden for students.","I want to acknowledge the efforts the CAPS has put into combating mental health issues. However, a clear and present problem is that it has its limitations when it comes to international students and students of other backgrounds. Many of my international friends reflected that they never heard of the CAPS or that they don't think it is beneficial because of the language barrier and the cultural differences. Thus, I highly suggest that the CAPS reach out more to students of different backgrounds and make plans more suitable to them. After all, UCSB is a diverse and global community.","The university definitely could have handled the situation better as I have noticed that the notification to students on these assaults were often not on time. In addition to more timely notification, I believe that a text message-alarming system can be implemented to notify students immediately in such situations to enhance as much transparency as possible for safety concerns. Moreover, it is best to livestream the town halls to ensure that students who cannot make it are being updated.","Theoretically, I believe Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses, but the question is how to ensure that it is carried out thoroughly. Therefore, I think there is space to improve, and we should be aware that without proper education and awareness, a simple bill is not able to prevent all undesired conducts.","I am not able to speak for these groups, but from an outside perspective, I believe UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups since I am able to feel the tolerant atmosphere at the campus personally. However, outside the campus (like in IV and other places), students still face discrimination as some of my friends have told me that right now, during the harsh time of Covid-19, people were laughing at and insulting them because they were wearing masks and are Asians. Again, it is our responsibility to serve underrepresented groups not only inside the campus but also the entire community. I hope our university could help this by promoting awareness of the existence of various organizations and student bodies and encourage these groups to spread cultures and reduce discrimination.","The first bill I plan to author is undoubtedly an Emergency Act that prepares funds and specifies a set of measures to be taken under emergencies such as pandemics. At the very moment of the coronavirus outbreak, our campus was not ready to face the severity and abruptness. Thus, for a long while, students were living under the risk of being infected and did not know where to go. Students from foreign countries, although reluctant to return to their home countries, had to leave because they believed living in dorms were no longer safe due to the population density of rooms and dining halls. Moreover, certain classes were suddenly cancelled as UCSB switched to remote instruction, leading to problems of delayed majors, graduations, and below-requirement workloads. These are but not the only issues that the Act will deal with, and such a bill sets a remarkable cornerstone for ensuring safety and housing, academic wellbeing, and essential businesses of all students and faculties during an unprecedented crisis of this kind.","I would like to stress that the fact I, an international student, am running for senate demonstrates that A.S. is already becoming more accessible. As an international student that might be considered an atypical candidate, I believe that there should be more advertising (via youtube, email, fakebook pages, etc.) to especially international students. International students make up approximately 20% of this campus, and I believe that reaching out and making AS resources more accessible to international students especially, will make AS more accessible as a whole. It is essential to let students know that A.S. and the Student Senate can indeed make a difference on their life and the whole campus. I would also like to share my experience encouraging students of all backgrounds to participate.","The top priority should be establishing a fully coordinated and united UC system that deals with natural disasters/global emergencies and graduates pay wholeheartedly and effectively. The regents should look for a president who reflects values of equity in education and shows skills of adaptability to crises and the constantly evolving situations of students in the UC system. Most importantly, the president should open to students and actively listen to their concerns.",,,,,,,
Jackson Tofft,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jackson-Tofft-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,3rd ,Political Science and Environmental Studies Double Major ,,,"I am running to be a senator in the 71st AS senate because I want to enact tangible change for the Isla Vista community and believe that I have the skills necessary to advocate for the needs of the student body. Though the AS senate has recently taken a number of significant steps to help the students of UCSB, I believe there is still a great deal of work that can be done and needs to be done. For nearly as long as I can remember, the power of those in public office to bring positive change to their constituents has captivated me. Likewise, one of my major goals starting in high school has been to advocate for the interests of my peers and to the best of my means bring about the changes that they wish to see and that would be most impactful to them. For this reason, along with many others, I am running to be a member of the 71st AS senate. I believe it is my duty to use the skills that I have to help my peers at UCSB and to ensure that the institution they are intrinsically linked to is doing everything it possibly can to ensure that their quality of life is as high as it can be.","Since spring quarter of my freshman year at UCSB I have been a member of the Zeta Kappa chapter of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and have held two executive committee positions. Being the risk manager and the vice president of the Zeta Kappa chapter has taught me a great deal about leadership and communication, and has given me the tools to be a successful and productive senator. Both of these positions have required me to coordinate with others and reach compromises between opposing viewpoints so as to take action that is satisfactory to every individual, regardless of their views. The inability to reach compromises between two opposing factions is a major contributor to political inaction at all levels and forms of democratic government. Likewise, I believe the ability to find a common ground that allows for action to be taken by a governing body is not only beneficial, but imperative for the attainment of the ultimate goal of any democratic governing body; positive change for the people it represents. I believe that my experiences as a leader in my fraternities chapter have greatly honed my ability to attain compromise, and that this ability will translate to my potential career as an AS senator.","The first bill I would write and introduce to the senate would create an ‘IVLandlords101’ resources packet and website with the sole purpose of better informing UCSB students living in Isla Vista of the ways they can hold their landlords accountable for unacceptable living conditions. In addition to educating student tenants about the ways they can hold landlords accountable, this virtual resource center would also explain legal jargon and technical stipulations commonly found in lease agreements so that student tenants are not compelled to sign an agreement that takes advantage of them just to have a place to live.

Another bill I plan to propose would increase the presence of the AS office of sustainability in Isla Vista to aid students living in Isla Vista in increasing their environmental consciousness and sustainable practices. Half of this bill would be educational, creating an outreach program to give students a clearer idea of the impact their daily practices have on the environment and easy ways they can reduce their carbon footprint and waste, and the other half would be tangible actions conducted in conjunction with the AS senate, the AS office of Sustainability and local governmental authorities. This tangible action portion would include constructing AS recycling bins like those found on campus in Isla Vista, and dispersing energy saving technologies like LED light bulbs and smart power strips to students living in Isla Vista to aid them in reducing their electricity usage which would have the dual effect of saving them money on electricity bills and reducing their carbon footprint.

Finally, I would propose a bill that would increase funding for the AS food bank for the purpose of creating a low-income food bank in Isla Vista. Though the AS food bank does much to address the problem of food insecurity in the UCSB community with their on campus location, I believe that they could do more by broadening their presence to include a food bank in Isla Vista. This would further the resources available to students that may be food insecure, and better encourage food insecure students who may see the on campus food bank as inconvenient to take advantage of the resources available to them.","The main premise of my platform is increasing the quality of life of UCSB students living in Isla Vista by any and all means available to the AS senate. This would be achieved through educational and active means. The educational being programs like a virtual tenant resource center to help student tenants in their negotiations with property management companies and landlords, and an outreach program to educate students on simple and cost effective ways they can save money on their electricity bills. The active means would entail programs like the dispersal of AS subsidized energy saving technologies to the Isla Vista community, initiatives in conjunction with local governing bodies to increase the maintenance and construction of sidewalks in Isla Vista, and the broadening of the AS food bank’s reach to include a location in Isla Vista. It is my belief that the best way to achieve these goals is to effectively communicate the tremendous benefit these programs would offer to students to the other members of the senate while being receptive to the criticisms they may offer. Many of the goals of my platform exist in some capacity already, however my plan is mainly to increase their scope and therefore the benefit they directly provide.","The main AS organizations I hope to work with to achieve the goals of my platform if elected include the Food Bank, Legal Resource Center, Environmental Affairs Board, Book Bank, and the Isla Vista Tenants Union. Non-AS entities I plan to work with to attain the goals of my platform include the Santa Barbara County Department of General Services, the Isla Vista Community Services district, the Office of the Third District supervisor, and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault. I believe that working with these organizations is imperative in attaining the goals of my platform because they have the practical experience and understanding of how to effectively induce change and implement the aspects of my platform in order to do the most good for the students of UCSB. With the assistance and consultation of these organizations, along with the constructive criticism of the AS senate, I believe the points of my platform have a tremendous potential to be implemented, and to enact tangible positive change for the UCSB students living in Isla Vista. No change on the scale envisioned by my platform is attainable by a single individual. Conversely, real change necessitates the contributions of numerous organizations and individuals within those organizations that care about making a positive impact.","Though the decision by UCSB to switch to exclusively virtual instruction for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year constitutes a communications challenge for representatives and their constituents, it also presents an opportunity for the implementation of creative and new means of communicating. Once elected to an AS off campus senate position, my first goal before introducing the bills I would propose would be to establish a means for my constituents to communicate with me that effectively addresses the circumstances of online instruction. This method would likely include posting zoom video chat links on my social media accounts where students could voice their concerns and ask questions once a week or potentially more often. Additionally, I would make my email easily available to my constituents so that students who wish to send more detailed and lengthy descriptions of their concerns and ideas could do so. In general, my goal regarding this topic is to provide my constituents with as many ways to contact me as possible, and ways that fit all student needs. In my opinion there is no substitute for in person contact with students. However, given the nature of the current circumstances and the necessity to protect public health in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, virtual methods of communication are imperative.","I believe the single most important characteristic of any elected official or public servant is a passion improving the quality of life of their constituents. Without this, there is no real driving force compelling a public servant to enact change and they essentially become talking heads who spew rhetoric without taking any real action. Additionally candidates for public office should ideally have great communication skills, a knack for finding a common ground between two opposing viewpoints, the ability to listen carefully and consistently and the courage to advocate for the needs of their constituents no matter the circumstances. With these qualifications in mind, I believe that I am the best candidate for off campus senator because I have made a concerted effort to foster the growth of my communication skills in all of my exploits, have learned how to attain compromise through my leadership experiences, and above all possess an undying passion to do good for people that both makes me an attentive and careful listener and gives me the courage to voice the needs of the people regardless of the personal consequences. The combination of all of these traits, both practiced and natural, truly set me apart from any other candidate. In essence, I believe I am the best candidate because I am not interested in the personal gain to be had from being an AS senator, but the power to enact change and better the lives of my peers that it bestows.",A. Left leaning,"I would assess the work of the 70th AS senate in addressing the needs of the student body as very good. They have taken measures to increase the access of the student body to mental health professionals, to implement low cost food options for low income individuals that may be in a state of food insecurity, and have taken action to lower the costs of mandatory academic materials such as textbooks. These three actions address what I believe to be three of the greatest problems affecting UCSB students; mental health, food insecurity, and academic costs. Having praised the steps taken by the 70th AS senate, I am in no way claiming that the work of the senate is complete, nor that there is no further room for improvement.","As an institution that claims to advocate for and promote human progress, it is imperative that UCSB give considerable thought to the actions of the companies it chooses to associate with and invest in. For the actions of those companies will ultimately reflect back upon UCSB. Having said that, at this time I am not adequately informed on what specific policies the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement advocates for, and consequently cannot endorse nor condemn a potential resolution regarding the matter. The most important action the senate can take on this matter is to listen carefully to the demands and beliefs of the students they represent so as to yield a resolution that best accommodates all students.","I do not believe UCSB should be completely tuition free, however I do believe that tuition costs should be substantially lowered and should be used more efficiently to ensure that students are more directly and positively impacted by their tuition payments. This would likely include a reallocation of funds from uses such as administration bonuses and incentives to other areas that would more directly benefit the students. Additionally, tuition should include the subsidy of textbooks, iclickers, online program fees, and other ‘hidden’ fees that so often bring unforeseen financial hardship upon UCSB students.","While I acknowledge that UCSB programs such as CAPS do provide a level of mental health resources to the student body, and have improved in recent years, calling them adequate would insinuate that there is no further room for growth which I do not believe. Mental health is one of the greatest challenges facing current and future UCSB students, and is constantly growing and evolving. By my estimation, one of the greatest obstacles facing students that may have mental health issues is finding the time to receive help within their incredibly busy academic schedules. Addressing this obstacle is the next step in improving the mental health services available to the student body and perhaps the most difficult to implement. While the online LiveHealth function of the CAPS website and the crisis phone line provide a high level of convenience to busy students that may be experiencing a mental health crisis, perhaps expanding the #saysomething program and the overall variety of programs available to students would further address the needs of students in need of different levels of care and with extremely busy schedules.","Situations like what occurred multiple times during fall quarter put the university in a difficult place because they have to primarily deliver justice for the victims of sexual misconduct, while ensuring that an impartial and fair investigation is conducted so as to provide due process to the accused. However, even given the difficulty of addressing the concerns of the campus community and providing an impartial and thorough investigation, it is my belief that there are a number of small and simple steps that could have been taken by the university that would have addressed the concerns and needs of the campus community much better than what occurred. First and foremost, the university refrained from the releasing the name(s) of the greek organizations that were under investigation and where the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place. Though publicizing the names of the organizations under title IX investigation would undoubtedly have impacted those organizations, providing that information to the student body is critical in my opinion. Simply providing the name of the organization where the sexual misconduct was alleged to have taken place would allow students to make better informed decisions about which organizations they associate with, and ultimately help them protect their safety in the future.","Title IX provides an adequate framework and set of ‘rules’ for the universities to refer to when addressing sexual assault. However, this set of framework and regulations governing the investigation process does not provide a specific timeline an investigation should follow. While it is incredibly important to ensure that due process is given to the accused, this lack of a stipulated timeline by title IX often causes investigations and grievance hearings to be drawn out for very long amounts of time. This bureaucratic inefficiency could be cause for survivors of sexual assault to be intimidated by the entire process, having to manage their daily responsibilities in addition to a title IX procedure, and to perhaps be less inclined to report sexual misconduct. This is a massive problem, as it is the duty of the UC system and any public institution of higher education to ensure that a safe environment is created for all students, and that they will act to bring justice to perpetrators of sexual misconduct. Therefore, it is my belief that UCSB’s title IX protocol should be amended so as to make the process as streamlined and swift as possible while still ensuring due process is given to both sides.","Not being a member of one of these historically oppressed groups myself, I feel I am unqualified to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of UCSB’s programs designed to help these groups. Likewise, it is imperative for the senate to listen carefully to the criticisms of the programs provided by UCSB that may be offered by individuals or organizations representing these groups. However, as I stated in my response to the question of the adequacy of UCSB’s mental health services, I believe that the term ‘adequate’ implies that no further progress is necessary. Therefore, in the case of UCSB’s assistance and service to historically oppressed groups on campus, I believe there is always room for improvement. It is my belief that programs offered by campus organizations like the MCC should be expanded and publicized more to the campus community. Requiring that students take classes that discuss the history of these oppressed groups in order to graduate (such as the ethnicity requirement) is valuable and necessary to inform the student population of the struggles these groups have endured in the past and continue to endure today. Increasing student participation and interest in events put on by the MCC would further this goal, and better inform students about the struggles of oppressed groups and what they can do in their daily lives to show solidarity and support to these groups.","The first bill I will author as a member of the AS senate will allocate a reasonable amount of funding to increase the amount of resources available to students living in Isla Vista regarding interactions with property management companies and landlords. Too many students in our community sign lease agreements that may take advantage of them without fully understanding the stipulations and legal jargon in the agreements. Furthermore, too many students living in Isla Vista suffer through sub-par living conditions with no real way to hold their property management companies or landlords accountable for the conditions of their residences. This bill would create a ‘checklist’ that students could refer to before signing a lease to identify in more understandable terms common stipulations in lease agreements that may have a negative impact on them in the future. Additionally, the bill would create a ‘landlord101’ informational website and set of brochures/packets that would seek to inform students in Isla Vista of their rights as a tenant, and the ways they can hold their landlords accountable for their living conditions.","It is no secret that the primary means students receive information in the modern era is through social media. Likewise, I would propose the creation of a UCSB AS senate social media account to be implemented on all major social media platforms with the purposes of providing detailed accounts of what goes on at every meeting, and outreach to students using polls and other methods to gauge the interests of the student body. Though the AS senate facebook page provides students with a means of live streaming senate meetings, it is my belief that the AS Senate should expand its social media presence to all major social media platforms to further increase the amount of transparency present for students. These accounts would make live streams of senate meetings available to a larger portion of the student body, provide links to bills and resolutions that are passed to provide increased transparency to students, and utilize polls to better gauge the student body’s attitudes and opinions towards the agenda of the senate and the resolutions they may pass. Creating social media accounts such as these for the AS senate would greatly help to bridge the gap between the students and their elected representatives, and overall make the duties and processes of the senate more accessible to students.","The two top priorities for the next UC president in my opinion are implementing a cost of living adjustment for graduate students, and lowering undergraduate tuition costs. Both of these issues are incredibly important for the UC system to address in the coming years. As the cost of living has increased for the past four decades, wages have stagnated and not proportionally increased. UC tuition costs have also continuously increased over this same time span. In order to serve justice to the graduate and undergraduate students that are the lifeblood of the UC system, a cost of living adjustment must be implemented for graduate students, and undergraduate tuition rates must be lowered or at least utilized by the university more efficiently so as to provide greater tangible benefits to students. It is the duty of the UC system to strive to attain these goals, and benefit their students in any and every way that they can.",,,,,,,

I believe I am well-equipped to do that. I want to make sure all groups within our diverse community at UCSB are represented because I want to serve every Gaucho. I love our community, as it is filled with wonderful people that have accepted me with open arms and I believe it is my duty to give back and serve my community as best as I can. It is my goal to make positive changes for the current and future members of UCSB.","Being a part of Greek life, I’ve had the opportunity to hear about so many different experiences and involvements from members within my fraternity and it has inspired me to seek a leadership role on campus! ​I have developed my necessary academic skills in my first year, and am now ready to move on to leadership positions like in high school.​ I have many leadership positions from high school that have prepared me to be a senator such as being the Director of Activities, which taught me a lot about being the liaison between the student body and administrative board and expressing the entire student voice. There, I worked on a team of other AS students and made sure to make positive changes in our high school and represent the student body, a skill I plan on transitioning to the 71st senate.","While in office, the three bills or resolutions I would like to introduce would be tenant resources for the residence of Isla Vista, increasing study spaces off-campus, and improving local environmental sustainability practices. More precisely, I would want to provide residents of Isla Vista with an abundance of information educating them on their tenant’s rights along with ways to decrease tenant-landlord conflict. I want to make sure that students aren’t getting taken advantage of by management companies and leases. With this resolution, I also hope to provide ways in which tenants can hold their landlords more accountable and I hope to work with organizations like Isla Vista Tenants Union in order to provide residents of Isla Vista the most support possible. In regards to increasing study spaces off-campus, I would like to pass a bill that would allow students who live in Isla Vista to have more conveniently placed study spaces located off-campus so that they have more accessibility to have places to go do work in. In regards to the improvement of local environmental sustainability, I would like to introduce a bill to inspire environmental consciousness to Isla Vista residents along with ways to improve and innovate the local recycling and composting system. I would like to work with local environmental organizations in order to properly enact this bill.","My platform revolves around community improvement and efficiency. I want to make sure I improve UCSBs community as best as possible to ensure everyone is benefiting. As mentioned earlier, I would like to introduce bills and resolutions, such as tenant resources for the residents of Isla Vista, increasing study spaces off-campus, and improving local environmental sustainability practices, and hope to work with local organizations to ensure efficiency with these ideas. Other main points on my platform would be to implement a rental system in the library where students can borrow laptop and/or phone chargers, expand blue light systems into Isla Vista along with lighting expansion projects in order to increase the safety of community residents, provide residents of Isla Vista with consistent and easy training on Naloxone, a nasal spray that can save the lives of people who have overdosed, and increase the amount of school supplies, such as Scantrons, that can be bought in stores off-campus. I hope to work with AS along with the library in order to create an effective and efficient rental system for device charging supplies so that students can always have the resources they need while studying in the library– something especially useful during midterms and finals. In regards to expanding the blue light system and lighting expansion projects in Isla Vista, I plan on working with IVTU, IVCSD, and EVPLA in order to make these improvements happen. I also plan to continue to work with The Student Health/Alcohol & Drug Program to sustain and improve the Naloxone training to ensure students are well equipped to prevent a drug overdose, hoping to save many lives. Finally, I will try to work with local stores in Isla Vista in order to increase the number of school supplies sold in order for students to have convenient locations to purchase items, such as Blue Books and Scantrons, on their way to class as they leave their residence located off-campus. My platform is focused on delivering methods to improve the college experience for all students with the hopes of making long-lasting impacts!","I would like to work with Isla Vista Tenants Union in order to provide residents of Isla Vista sufficient information educating them on their tenants rights to ensure that they don’t get taken advantage from by their leasing companies. I also hope to work with organizations like IVTU, IVCSD, and EVPLA in order to expand the blue light system and lighting expansion projects in Isla Vista. In regards to inspiring environmental consciousness in residents of Isla Vista along with the improvement of local recycling and compost systems, I plan on working with organizations like Refuse, Recycling, and Research Center (R3C) and Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) in order to effectively achieve this aspect of my platform. Another organization that I plan on working with is The Student Health/Alcohol & Drug Program to sustain and improve the Naloxone training. These are just a handful of the many organizations I plan on working with. I am also open to hearing my constituents if they have any suggested organizations that I should work with.","If online courses continue through the summer and fall quarter, then I will make sure I am always available to my constituents because I want to make sure I can address their needs and be an available outlet for them to seek. For example, I will plan weekly ZOOM office hours and will also be willing to schedule personal appointments. I would also post as much information as possible on social media platforms to be as transparent as I can be and allow users to interact with me through that medium. I will also post all of my contact information such as cell phone numbers and email just in case constituents want to reach out to me in that way. I will also post a Google form so that students can add comments or questions there too. Ultimate availability is one of my main goals so that everyone can reach out to me. I am also willing to communicate through other mediums if my constituents give me any suggestions because I want to be flexible in order to address them.
","There are many reasons as to why I believe I am the best candidate for this position, such as my compassion, drive, and eagerness to make positive changes. However, the most important reason as to why I would make the best candidate for this position is that I will make sure to address the needs of my constituents and voice all of their opinions as best as possible. I will always put their needs first. I have an organized and driven work ethic that is dependable. I have specific and tangible plans and ideas on how to make positive improvements. I have a strong familiarity with Legal Code and I am always open to hearing varying ideas on different issues and ways to address them. Another important trait that senators need is the capability to work in teams, and since I would be working with multiple other senators and executive board members, I believe I have strong communication skills in order to work in an efficient group due to past teamwork experiences that I have. For reasons like this and many more, I believe I am more than well-equipped to be your next off-campus senator!",(a) Left-leaning,"(b) Very Good. I believe the 70th A.S. Senate has done a very good job of addressing the needs of the student body. With such a dedicated and motivated group of students driven to make positive changes, the student body had a great group of students making sure the needs of the student body were being addressed. The 70th A.S. Senate was a very cohesive group of leaders who served as great liaisons for BCUs.","I would have to hear with my constituents before I gauge my opinion on this topic. In order to confidently vote on the best option, I would need to hear from students from all sides of this debate as their input is valuable to my decision. I am here to serve my constituents, and I need to take into consideration their opinions before I decide.","Ideally, I would love for our education here at UCSB to be free. However, due to the systems in place, the way our economy works and all, the education we currently receive along with all of the resources would not be made possible without the tuition students pay. I do believe however that the fees students pay should be allocated fairly and there should be a stronger push to lower student fees for low-income backgrounds. I understand tuition is necessary to support the resources we receive, but we should try to alleviate the costs wherever they can be.","I do believe the mental health services at UCSB are satisfactory for some students. There are many programs and organizations on campus that aid students with mental health issues. There are services like CAPS, The Mental Health Town Hall, and UCSB CARE and many others that are all great resources for students to use. However, the circulation of said resources could be improved. A lot of students that attend UCSB are unaware of these services and the benefits that they provide and I believe a great way to improve these resources would be to increase the circulation of knowledge about these programs to students so that they can be more aware of the great benefits that they provide. There is one problem I’d like to address, and that would be the lack of funds that these programs and organizations get. I would like to strategize a way for these services to be given the adequate funds necessary in order for them to function as best as possible. Overall, the mental health services serve the student body adequately, but no system is perfect and there is always room for improvement.","I believe the university tried with great effort to address this situation correctly, but there could have definitely been a more adequate way in addressing these concerns as many students felt that the university wasn’t doing enough. To start off, the university was slow in responding to these issues and a faster job could have been done. Also, the information that the university provided students in regards to these reports were very vague which confused many students. However, once the university got in-control, they started to resolve some, not all, of the issues, such as creating the UCSB Safer Social Events Taskforce where the Inter Fraternal Council (IFC) established new social practices that would increase safety during fraternal events. Along with that, they also put fraternities on social moratorium as they tried to resolve more of these issues. Overall, efforts were made by the university to address these issues, but there were a number of ways in which they could have handled the situation better.","Title IX encompasses a great idea with a great system in mind to address sexual assault, but there are a couple of ways in which it could be more adequate in order to protect all students of the university. Title IX fails to support the safety of our Isla Vista community, as their rules apply to university-owned buildings and spaces, but many students live off-campus and it is the University’s job to protect all students regardless of where they live.","As a member of a historically underrepresented group, I believe that UCSB is trying to serve historically underrepresented groups, including members of the Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+ community and others, but they need to do more. To start off, the SRB has a handful of cultural resource centers such as the African Diasporic Cultural Resource Center (AdCRC), Asian Resource Center (ARC), and Middle Eastern Resource Center (MERC) just to name a few. All of these resources are there for underrepresented groups to make use of in order to benefit their needs, which is an effective way that UCSB tries to serve these historically underrepresented groups. Along with this, there are a bunch of clubs on campus that people from these underrepresented groups can be a part of in order to enrich their college experience. However, these resource centers and clubs could benefit from greater funding, which would be a more effective way in which UCSB could better serve these groups. There is always more work to be done!","If I am elected to serve on the Senate, the first bill I plan to author would either be a bill that would increase the number of study spaces available to students off-campus so that they have a more convenient location to study or a bill that would reform and improve both the recycling and composting systems in and around Isla Vista in order for us to preserve and protect our local environment.","As a senator, I would work to involve the student body more and keep them informed about what the Senate is doing by providing our community with a variety of information such as through social media, schoolwide sent emails, pamphlets, advertisements near the arbor, advertisements across Isla Vista, and through online streaming like ZOOM. By doing so, students could be more aware of the changes that are being made along with information on how they could make a change too. Also, I believe that open forums would be a great way for students to input their opinions along with open discussions that would allow for a diverse standpoint on issues. As a senator, I would also make myself approachable and as available as possible in order for me to serve my community and their needs. It is my goal to reach out to as many students as possible and serve them.","One of the top priorities for the next UC President would be to implement ways that would address times of crises and establish well-formed procedures and programs that would help students out during these events. There have been many catastrophic events in recent years, such as fires and the current Coronavirus, both of which have caused many students to evacuate their residencies near or on campus. The next UC President should prioritize procedures that will ensure all students with the resources needed in order to cope with such crises so that they aren’t put in harm’s way and are able to adequately adjust to such drastic changes. The next UC President must also address the COLA movement because graduate students are valuable to our institution and they need to be supported.",,,,,,,

Ryan Stofer,sofia,On Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_4571.jpg,,He / Him / His,1st,Mathematics,,,"I am running a senator with the 71st senate because I really do want to see change made across our campus. I have always been the type of person who is proactive and will take the first step in hopes of serving my community and helping others along the way. I have always enjoyed holding leadership positions throughout high school and when I came to UCSB, I wanted to expand my leadership skills even farther. Additionally, I wanted to find a role that helps communities or individuals that do not have a voice in issues and are not represented in certain organizations. As such, after learning more information about what an A.S. senator does and how they work to improve campus life, I have been excited and passionate to run to be one of the next senators for the 2020-2021 school year. In addition, I am running with the Isla Vista Party because my ideals coincide more with them. That being said, I am also excited to work with Campus United if I get the position in the upcoming term, since all of them are nice individuals and bipartisanship is important to creating tangible change for our campus. I am running to be a senator because I want to utilize my leadership skills to help the whole of campus and to represent marginalized voices in our community.","Throughout this past year, I was a member of the Residential Housing Association (RHA), which runs programs and holds events for ALL of our on campus residents. In addition, I have had the opportunity to speak with fellow Resident Directors, Assistant Resident Directors, and many Residential Assistants which helped me understand their different roles in serving the different needs of the residents. Furthermore, RHA holds weekly coordinating board meetings where we vote on flyering, support, and funding requests that pertain to any on-campus related event. As such, I have been informed of all the different funding organizations available across campus, where most are in fact AS entities. Too, not only was a member of RHA, I held a co-president position for my hall council. As co-president, I held weekly meetings for our hall council members and facilitated discussion about smaller funding requests that pertained to our building. Overall, my experience of being in RHA has not only given me connections to other on-campus organizations and experience in handling funding requests / voter representation, I have also immensely improved my leadership skills. I hope to use all of my knowledge from this past year and apply it to next year’s 71st senate.","If I was elected to serve on the Senate, one resolution I would plan to introduce is a resolution for the UC system to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. UCSB is the only UC school that has yet to pass such a resolution related to the current BDS movement occurring in today’s world. I believe that it is wrong that the UC system is able to act as a complicit third party to support corporations that profit off of Israel’s illegal occupation. Another bill I plan to introduce would be a bill to issue virtual office hours for all senators. Of course, this bill is quite tentative since we currently do not know if the current COVID-19 pandemic will make us continue our education through online learning for fall quarter of 2020. However, if that case does arise, I want to ensure that student concerns are still addressed through the creation of these virtual office hours, which can be held on Zoom or any other video conferencing platform. Finally, the last resolution I would author is a resolution against current discrimination against Asian groups during the past few months. It is a fact that many Asian communities have inadvertently been affected by the recent pandemic due to cases of verbal assault or other forms of discrimination. As such, I wish to author a resolution that condemns such discrimination as we as a community should be accepting of one another and in fact we have students from all across the world that attend UCSB who all wish to pursue their educational goals and should not be held back by any sort of racial discrimination.","My platform is mainly focused on five different topics, which I call, “D.R.E.A.M.”. The first is to distribute testing materials by adding machines in Far Side and some near Santa Catalina and to also include a program that distributes free testing materials for those in need. Next, I plan on working with Dining Services to make roll-over swipes an option for all students. In addition, this implementation will not raise the prices of our other current meal plan options. I also want to expand the services of CLAS through a creation of one-on-one service and increasing funding support so more students can get assistance through the program. Furthermore, I want to create more accessibility to mental health services since although CAPS is a great resource, the availability ranges throughout the year due to high demand. As such, I want to have office hours available for all on-campus residents. Finally, I would like to establish a one-on-one mentorship program that can be available for all on-campus students. Of course, the cost of this program also will not raise tuition or housing prices for any student. These are all of my main goals I have for my personal platform this next year.","As mentioned in the previous question, I have many organizations/entities that I want to reach out to in order to reach my goals for my platform. First off, I would like to contact UCSB University and Community Housing Services to see if and how I can allow the establishment of these vending machines for testing materials to be placed in the different residence halls. Next, I plan on reaching out to Dining Services to work out the logistics of implementing the option of roll-over swipes as a meal option for students. Also, I plan on working with CLAS to see what possible improvements can be made, whether if it is through financial support or through more sessions so that they can cater to more students. In addition, I want to work very closely with CAPS to see how they have tackled the high demand of requests for appointments and see what I can do to assist them. Finally, I want to reach out to the EOP, since they have already established the EOP Peer Mentorship program, and try to implement a similar one for any on-campus residents that are first-gen students. Even if not all goals are seen to fruition by the end of my term, I definitely want to tackle each issue and start change for the students on campus.","If the shift to online courses continues through summer and fall quarter, I will not hesitate to create virtual outlets to allow students to address their concerns pertaining to campus life. Of course, the easiest way to accomplish this goal would be to publicize my email to all so they have an immediate method to reach me. However, I also plan on hosting office hours through Zoom weekly so the discussion can be more one-on-one. In fact, if it truly does play a role in next year’s fall quarter, I plan on authoring a bill that mandates all senators to host virtual office hours as well. In addition, I will work with other on-campus senators to host a public forum that is available to all on-campus residents through a video conferencing app. This public forum would be to help address student concerns, particularly about campus involvement as we continue through online learning. Too, I will also share different resources or announcements from organizations through my social media accounts as I want to ensure people are informed of what is happening around campus. Either way, I want to enhance my online presence in order to help my constituents if they are in need of resources or want their voices to be heard in discussions.","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position as I am motivated to address student body concerns that are related to our campus. I hold student opinion on issues seriously and I am proactive in finding possible solutions, whether it be through outreach or compromise. I truly do want to see UCSB improve over time, and I am passionate about holding a senator role in order to accomplish these goals. In addition, I have had hands-on experience related to housing and have enhanced my leadership skills that are aligned with UCSB values. I do know what programs are available to assist student needs and I have connections with some organizations, such that I can work with them to improve the campus through my “D.R.E.A.M.” plan. Finally, I am willing to work with others in collaboration to achieve these goals. Of course, I am not only referencing the different organizations I am planning on reaching out to, but rather the future 71st senate as well. I love working with others and I am sure other senators in the 71st senate would be glad to help me out to achieve these goals and in return, I will also help them to attain their goals as well. In the end, we are all working together with the main goal of making the campus better, so it is best that we help each other during these challenging times.",Left-leaning,"Excellent; I believe that the 70th A.S. Senate has done great work in creating bills updating legal code while also passing resolutions that are in favor of the student body. In addition, the current A.S. Senate’s weekly meetings have been very beneficial for addressing student concerns during the public forum, especially about discussing the current COLA strikes. ",Yes; I am in full support of the BDS movement and I believe that it is wrong that the UC system is allowed to act as a “complicit third party” to support corporations that allow Israel’s occupation to violate the lives of others.,"Yes; I whole-heartedly believe that UCSB should be tuition-free for all students. Of course, this issue is not one that can be resolved at the school level, but can be advocated by students across campus to fight for a tuition-free campus.","Although there are mental health services available at UCSB, I believe that the current state of mental health services are inadequate and are in need of change as soon as possible. I think that the biggest issue surrounding mental health services is that there are not enough personnel/therapists to assist students as it is in high demand. Furthermore, the stigma surrounding mental health in itself is an issue that must be addressed. As such, the best solution to this issue would be to allow more funding to CAPS so that they are able to assist more students on campus. In addition, other student organizations, both in and out of campus, should host events regarding mental health such that the stigma of mental health is resolved. Of course, the fight for mental health is one that takes time and although the mental health services at UCSB may not be able to fully an individual, there are definitely strides that can be made to make them more efficient and helpful to all.","I whole-heartedly believe that UCSB could have definitely handled the reports of sexual assault better during this past year. Although announcements and e-mails were sent out to students weeks after the original incidents occurred, the response time was delayed and required more immediate action as students felt that their thoughts were not being heard by campus administration. I believe that better communication could have been established after the first reports were made. Although I understand the university can not act on reports without substantial evidence, a simple acknowledgement of the issue at hand could ease tensions between the university and student body. Thus, it is essential that UCSB can learn from this past incident to make sure that, if events similar to this one in the near future arise, the university can create a faster response to ease worrying students. It would be unacceptable if their actions have not improved since the fall quarter of 2019.","I believe that Title IX is an “okay” system to address sexual assault on UC campuses, but still requires improvement. For UCSB at least, the Title IX Office ensures that each case is reviewed when given sufficient evidence and makes potential charges accordingly. That being said, I think that the enforcement of Title IX is one that can be refined for the UC campuses. Although the Title IX Office does work closely with the Office of Student Conduct and the Dean of Students Office when dealing with sexual assault cases, the process of going through such cases take a large amount of time and can be frustrating when the survivor’s story is not being identified as the truth. As such, even though the ideals of Title IX is one I fully support, the actual enforcement of Title IX can be changed to better support the survivor and as well as can be more effective with being more communicative when sexual assault reports are made on UC campuses.","I believe that UCSB is making valiant efforts to serve underrepresented groups, but can also further themselves to assist marginalized communities in the future as well. That being said, I am personally glad that there are services available for communities that can be found at the Multicultural Center and the Student Resources Building. However, although organizations are set up for these diverse communities across campus, advancements can still be made in creating safe spaces for these individuals. One of the biggest priorities UCSB should be focusing on is to ensure that these communities have a way to communicate their concerns or opinions on campus matters. What I mean by this is that the university should consistently make sure that minority voices are able to be heard in all conversations related to campus life. Having minority opinions in these types of conversations can aid these groups to be able to have a more equitable student life while being a student at UCSB.","If I was elected to serve on the Senate, the first resolution I would plan to author is a resolution for the UC system to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. To be frank, it is still surprising to me that UCSB is the only UC campus left that has yet to create any stance on this issue related to the BDS movement. As I said earlier, I believe that it is morally wrong that the UC system is able to act as a complicit third party to support corporations that profit off of Israel’s illegal occupation. Furthermore, the resolution would also indirectly support the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties. In addition, seeing that this exact resolution has been passed in all other UC campuses, it should be very tangible to pass in our own Senate by next year’s term.","I think that A.S. has the ability of connecting themselves to the whole student body simply by hosting events that are tailored to the public. Of course, there are already public forums available to all every week during each A.S. Senate meeting, but there could be more events created for the general student body. For example, having public forums or Q&A sessions open to students every month/quarter allows the student body to ask questions they have about what the Senate is up to with current bills or resolutions. Furthermore, having info sessions about A.S. for all on-campus residents can be highly beneficial in having students become more proactive in their community and could also influence them to be a part of A.S. in the future as well. Overall, I think the best solution to this underlying issue is to just present awareness of A.S. and explain the functionality and how A.S. is able to help the general student body.","One of the qualities that I would see as a top priority for choosing the next UC President is being able to listen and address both under-graduate and graduate student concerns. Time and time again, issues blow out of proportion as lead administration refuses to address student concerns whether it be a delayed response or simply none given. As such, a UC President who truly listens to student concerns can be highly beneficial in resolving conflict before any arises. Furthermore, the next UC President should be one who also focuses on the needs of students from low-income households. As tuition prices continue to rise, students from low-income households are forced to rely solely on FAFSA, Cal grants, scholarships, and any other financial aid support available. That being said, the next UC President should ensure that students relying on financial aid should be guaranteed that they will be able to finish their education without having to worry about financial aid being stripped away from them.",,,,,,,
Katrina Sacluti,sofia,On Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katrina-Sacluti.jpeg,,she/her/hers,1st,Political Science,,,"I am running to be an on-campus senator with the 71st senate because I want the senate to be made of students with bright ideas, enthusiasm, and overall want the best for UCSB and I firmly believe that I can contribute as a representative of these ideals. Part of our tuition goes towards Associated Students and my work will guarantee that those funds are going towards beneficial resources to help all students. I’m a student too, I don’t want the money that I spend to go to waste, to be used in vain. It’s not cheap to attend here! Students should not only be proud of the work that Associated Students does, but everyone should reap the benefits of them as well. There’s so many ideas that I have that I know can happen and aid all demographics on campus now and in the future from providing free access to feminine hygiene products for all students in bathrooms and determined areas in equal or greater quantity than the supply of free condoms to changing the swipe system to allow students to use their meals on other students, friends, or family as they wish to do without interference with rollover swipes. By being a senator, I don’t just have to advocate for my ideas, I can take action to make them be a reality.","I was a Pearman Fellow for the EVPSA office and worked specifically under the Legislative Director, becoming involved with issues within our campus and beyond, up to a state level. This is reassurance that I am not a stranger to the works behind A.S. and have experience aiding work already within Associated Students. I am also greatly involved in Kapatirang Pilipino, specifically KP’s political committee and Pilipino Cultural Night. Within KP’s political committee, we hold events to educate members of issues or movements related to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. I know what it takes to start from the beginning of a project, or in this case an event, and how to work on its logistical aspects until it’s built up. Though PCN had to be cancelled because of COVID-19, I still had the opportunity to experience being involved as a cast member and costumes committee member. Again, this underscores my ability to work on multiple things and collaborate. Moreover, I am in the Legal Education Association for Diversity (LEAD) because not only do I want to act on the behalf of my student population’s best interest, but I aspire to be a human rights lawyer and defend the defenseless after my undergraduate education. This seamlessly translates to the reason why I’m running in the first place: I want to be a senator to serve those like me who deserve to be served by the institution. Lastly, though this was not on campus or in Isla Vista, I find it important to highlight my experience the summer before I started attending UCSB in APAPA (Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs) -- an organization aimed to empower Asian and Pacific Islander Americans through education, leadership and active participation in civic and public affairs. Through it, I interned in my local Deputy District Attorney’s office because of it and gained a lot of experience in what it takes to work in an environment similar to the senate.","I feel very passionate about all the plans included on my platform and would love to introduce all of them as resolutions or bills while in office. One of them is providing free access to feminine hygiene products for all students in bathrooms and determined areas in equal or greater quantity than the supply of free condoms. I am all for supporting protection and safe sex, but as a woman, I can tell you that our periods are not as optional. I say this not to demean the supply of condoms, but to emphasize that pads and tampons should be as readily available, if not more available. A period can happen at any time while on campus and these items in bathrooms would be very supportive and reassuring for women. Second, I’d love to change the swipe system to allow students to use their meals on other students, friends, or family as they wish to do without interference with rollover swipes. We are the ones paying for these swipes and we have every right to use them as we please. To have additional swipes that could be used by guests yet be forced to pay $12 for each individual due to policy is greedy of the institution and not morally wrong. Lastly, I’d like to build our pre-law and pre-med advising to be stronger with exam practices, workshops, and personalized plans. Since we do not have a pre-nursing or pre-law major, I want to compensate through the strength of our professional advising.","My platform is for the students. I would know as a student. My platform is not plans for you, it’s plans for us. I’m a student and I want everything on my platform to go through. All my ideas are meant to support students and I believe that will consequently gain the support of students. Because the rest of the senate is made up of students, I know that a lot of them share my ideas or are supportive of them and as a result, for every idea will be a team behind me. At the end of the day, I’ll never be working for just myself or ever alone because I’ll have the support of Associated Students and the student body behind me who are all advocating for this. I also know student organizations that work towards certain items on my platform, such as free feminine hygiene products, and we could work together to make such ideas happen. I’ll make sure to give my attention to every item and will focus with one item at a time if deemed necessary, but again, because of the great support, I know that collaboration and support will have my items get established sooner than later.","There is a variety of specific organizations or entities I can work with in order to achieve my platform and I touched upon this in the previous question. For example, for free feminine hygiene products, I know there is a PERIOD Chapter at UCSB. It’s an organization whose goal is to provide free menstrual hygiene products in public bathrooms around campus and to increase awareness about period poverty and stigma. This is very similar to what I have in mind! We could definitely work together to make this happen and go into further detail, such as advocating for these feminine products to be sustainable and eco-friendly. We could even go further and promote the use of sustainable products like the menstrual cup. Throughout my platform, there is always an organization or group in discussion. I cannot change the swipe system without some extent of communication with UCSB Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises in the same way I cannot build the pre-law and pre-med advising without talking to the pre-professional advising department. For all of these ideas that have the factor of money, I would talk to the financial committee to work out a budget without the need to raise tuition. All in all, I plan to maintain correspondence with a range of entities to achieve what is best for our school.","To make myself available to my fellow students during my term if the shift to online courses continues through summer and fall quarter, I will have a public Facebook page specifically for this position, meaning an account separate from my personal one. On this page, I will publish my office hours. My office hours will be held over zoom. However, I would like to make it clear that my office hours are not the only times I can be reached. For example, my email will be available at all times. I check my email quite frequently, so you shouldn’t expect a long delay in response. If those two prior methods seem impersonal to you, I will also remain public in all my social media platforms to be accessible. I am okay with this flexible form of correspondence, a simple conversation in direct messages, but again I will be readily available in the two other ways as well and I’ll make that known. The link to my zoom for holding office hours will be available on all my accounts -- my professional Facebook and my personal social media platforms, as well as my email. Any way you know how to reach me and I’ll be there. I hold myself accountable to be active in all the ways that I just listed and you should not expect any less.","I am the best candidate for this position because I have the experience and capabilities to be professional and efficient in this specific work environment, the beneficial and meaningful ideas within my platform, and the passion and motivation to push each individual item on my platform through. All of these factors are important. I am credible and trustworthy. Though I am a first year and had my last on-campus quarter moved to remote learning, I am still able to identify areas of needed attention and help at our school. I believe that the items on my platform are things that you want, that we want. If you do not want the things on my platform to come to life, then you don’t have to vote for me. But I am confident that we all want to see a better UCSB -- a UCSB that feeds other students, friends, and family with the swipes we paid for and choose to use on them; a UCSB that looks out for those with periods and provides free menstrual products for them; a UCSB that wants the best for their students looking into professional professions and resources related to this pathway; a UCSB that expands CLAS and the accessibility of class resources with all students in mind; a UCSB that has nothing to hide when it comes to the transparency of Associated Students. You can contribute to making UCSB better for you, I, our fellow gauchos, and the students to come, as long as you believe in me and my ideas and vote.",Left-leaning,"Very good; I think the 70th A.S. Senate definitely had the student body in mind through their work and accomplishments (e.g. a resolution on rollover meal swipes), but there is always room for improvement and in this case, there is still plenty of work needed to be done to address all student needs.","Yes; I vote in favor of a resolution to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. By being the only ASUC that has not formally passed a resolution, we are consequently supporting these companies that profit from human rights violations in Israel.","No; UCSB should not be tuition free YET until being tuition free is universally adopted across the nation. I say this because as a public school, we are supported financially by the government and realistically UCSB cannot succeed as a tuition free university on its own without federal jurisdiction. All public universities need to be free through federal mandates.","The mental health services at UCSB are good, but surely there is more the university could do and provide. For example, with CAPS, your first three sessions are free and subsequent sessions are $15 co-pay -- only if you have UC SHIP or private health insurance. Things get difficult if you have the latter and it does not cover future sessions. CAPS is not as accessible as it is advertised to be, only truly available if one has enough funds. This unjustly puts those of less financial stability or without insurance at a disadvantage than those with money and with insurance, putting down an entire group of students. Additionally, after your first three, you are typically recommended to a community clinician. CAPS is made for short term therapy and that is not convenient for most students. I would like to work towards abolishing the co-pay if you have UC SHIP, considering UCSB’s value of mental health should translate to encompassing covering therapy with their health insurance. Moreover, it is an important investment to gradually have therapists available for long term counseling, especially when several students expect CAPS to always be there for them. Another change I would like to make within the scope of mental health services is to have a safe space for victims of sexual harassment and assault.","During Fall Quarter 2019, there were indeed multiple reports of sexual assault occurring on fraternity property and the critiques towards the university for its slow response to the reports and failure to address student concerns are absolutely just. The university could have handled the situation better in multiple ways. Date rape drugs were used at least twice at a UCSB fraternity event and they protected the fraternity’s image over the safety of the student body by purposefully leaving out which fraternity it was. This was a poor response from the school, especially considering the first reporting was on October 17th and a second one happened on October 27th. I was embarrassed by my choice of school within my first quarter, for being enrolled in the same institution as these predators and for my school of choice’s delay in proper action. This could have been prevented if Sigma Pi was called out since the beginning in order to alert students to be cautious or to stay away entirely. Instead of the fraternity being named and held accountable, us students were sent “safety tips” and later were offered self defense courses. While these initially seem helpful, it came across as victim blaming when there should be something done to the threat to the UCSB community. Sigma Pi got away with only a five day suspension. There needs to be more severe repercussions and stern background checking for Greek life, especially when matters have to do with sexual assault.","Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the university's programs and activities. Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, and retaliation are forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX. By word of mouth, this sounds like an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. It has the right values and ideas in mind; it has good intentions. Title IX requires schools to have an established procedure for handle complaints of sexual harassment. It grants schools the capability to issue no-contract directives to prevent accused students from approaching or interacting with you. Likewise, Title IX prohibits schools from certain actions like retaliating against someone for filing a report; schools are mandated to keep students and their reports safe from other or more harassment. The most important aspect to acknowledge is if these ideals are being acted upon -- unfortunately I would have to answer no, that UCs fall short still and UCSB is an example. How UCSB handled the sexual assaults within Sigma Pi demonstrates that these institutions may have an established procedure when it comes to sexual harassment, but it’s either insufficient or they do not follow through.","UCSB effectively serves historically underrepresented groups, but only through the work in Associated Students and student organizations. The institution itself holds back members of the black, latinx, LGBTQ+ community, and others and it is only the students themselves that serve historically underrepresented groups. I’ve experienced this firsthand through Pilipino Cultural Night (PCN). I was heavily involved in PCN as a cast member and costumes committee member. PCN is a show to display Filipino culture for students, staff, faculty, and our surrounding communities. It’s entirely student-run and a way to showcase of Filipino culture. According to the main coordinators, PCN has recently experienced problems, conflicting with UCSB over the use of empty spaces after school hours for PCN related events and practices. As a student representative, I feel passionate about supporting these clubs and standing up for them when faced with an adversary. These student organizations build communities that are safe havens for many students of shared backgrounds, cultures, interests, and so forth. For ethnic clubs, the lack of support from UCSB to permit use of empty spaces exemplifies an area I would combat alongside them. Perhaps, for UCSB to become more committed to serving minorities and discriminated groups, this is the first area they should look at. Afterwards, faculty could become more involved and provide support. UCSB needs to prioritize making and giving spaces to underrepresented communities. Though the showcase has been a success for years without faculty directly involved, their support does not have to be limited to attending the event. How they decide to contribute is uniquely up to them.","The first resolution that I would aim to author is for meal swipes. Changing the swipe system to allow students to use their meals on other students, friends, or family is very important to me because we are the ones paying for our swipes and it is our right to use them as we please. It is greedy for the institution to forbid it and knowing this year’s AS Senate passed a resolution in support of rollover meal swipes, I can see my goal being attainable as well. I would want these two resolutions to work together, not clash, by having meal swipes roll over without a cap until the end of the school year. Any of these swipes would be available for the student to use for themselves or for their guest(s). A close second would be for the expansion of free feminine hygiene products in bathrooms or other designated areas. I noticed there are some in the women’s center, SRB bathroom, and the A.S. food bank. There could be so much more improvement beyond that! I aspire to play a part in establishing the free access to feminine hygiene products for all students in bathrooms and determined areas in equal or greater quantity than the supply of free condoms which are notably present in several bathrooms on campus. If condoms can be provided in large amounts with no cost, so can pads and tampons.","Students feel A.S. is typically inaccessible to them and that is something I noted in my platform. Part of our student fees is for Associated Students and I find it so important for the student body to know exactly where their money is going towards and having that money ultimately go back to them through a range of resources. I want to increase the transparency of work of Associated Students starting with budget visibility, seeing exactly how much money is received and where it’s disbursed. Similarly, it shouldn’t be difficult for students to find what work has been done. Instead of requiring students to search on their own -- if they ever find the motivation to -- students should be receiving a monthly email that provides updates on the Senate from proposed resolutions, amendments, etc. Minutes can be attached if they wish to read about a meeting more thoroughly. These emails would also act as a reminder that students are capable and welcome to speak during a Senate meeting, keeping them informed and potentially attracting their involvement. Moreover, in general towards students seeing A.S. as inaccessible, I feel as though the Pearman Fellowship Program and positions within offices are not promoted well enough. Both are great opportunities to work directly in Associated Students and I would happily be part of the team to build their advertisement. If they choose to grow in involvement, A.S. would no longer feel so distant from them because they would realize they could directly be a part of it.","UC President Janet Napolitano is stepping down from her position in August and her replacement should recognize what I and many others consider to be the top priorities for the next UC President: tuition affordability, carbon neutrality, food insecurity, and reforming the UC’s approach towards preventing and responding to sexual harassment and assault. UC President Napolitano wanted to enroll historic numbers of California undergraduates and while this is appreciated, I would like the housing crisis of several UCs to be readjusted, the hunger of college students to be reduced, and the overall experience of every UC student to be enhanced. I hope a balance can be worked in which UCs can be more affordable through lowering costs or providing substantial financial aid all while maintaining quality and growth of its student resources and facilities. Moreover, considering how large the university system is and what an impact it could make, I hope that being economically conscious becomes a priority in our ten campuses, five medical centers, three affiliated national laboratories, and the statewide agriculture and natural resources program. Lastly, the UCs do have a history of students mixed in with sexual misconduct and disappointing responses to such events -- reformation is necessary here.",,,,,,,
Alexandra Perez,sofia,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alexandra-Perez.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,2nd,Political Science and History of Public Policy and Law double major,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 71st senate because I want to be a better resource to those around me and help implement new ideas to better support students. I have heard the complaints of my fellow friends and peers about how they feel that the university is not doing enough to support our students, and I agree. I am running to be a senator because I have big ideas and the ambition and drive to do it. When I arrived at UCSB, I was excited but also nervous because it was a whole new world. It was challenging adjusting to the quarter system and also being away from home. A lot of students seek help from the university and while the university does provide a lot of resources, I noticed how the resources fell short when it came to helping all of the student body. I am running for senator because I want to help meet the needs of students and provide more resources so everyone who attends UCSB can succeed and feels like they belong on this campus. I am running because I want to advocate on behalf of students and create real change for this university.","I have been involved in several ways on campus. One way is by being a member of RHA and hall council. Through this, I was able to create programs and events for the Santa Catalina community and allowed me to practice my communication and leadership skills. Another way was by serving as the Outreach and Recruitment Chair for A.S. Committee on Committees. This has prepared me by developing my professional skills and collaborating with other A.S. entities to focus on outreach for people to join A.S. and help make the system meet student needs. I have also been involved on campus by being an RA. Being an RA has taught me many skills such as time management, leadership skills, community development, and much more. It has helped me become a more all-around person and has allowed me to become a better resource to not only residents but to every one of my peers. I have also been involved in the political climate on campus in ways such as protesting in solidarity with the COLA strike. These involvements have prepared me to be a senator because they have allowed me to learn the needs of my fellow peers and the ways in which our university can better support our student body.","One bill I would like to introduce while I am in office is a bill to provide free menstrual products in places on campus such as resident hall bathrooms, lecture hall bathrooms, and non-binary bathrooms, and in places around Isla Vista. I know the 69th senate passed a bill to create a committee to explore how we can provide menstrual products and I want to build on the bill by collaborating with other organizations and entities to put it into action. This is important because menstrual products can be expensive and can be a resource for students that need menstrual products. This bill would put menstrual products in lecture hall bathrooms and in gender-neutral bathrooms around campus to guarantee that any student who needs a product will be able to attain one. Another bill I would introduce is a bill to establish a quarterly A.S. senate town hall to promote transparency between elected senators and their constituents in order to hold senators accountable and collect feedback and concerns from their peers. This would help make A.S. seem more accessible and as a resource for students to use when they want their voices to be heard. A resolution I would like to introduce is a resolution to condemn the human rights violations in the form of femicides happening in Mexico. Hate crimes against women in Mexico continue to occur each day and our UCSB A.S. Senate has a commitment to fight against human rights violations.","My platform is geared to help not only my constituency of Off-Campus residents but all students at this university. I have six main ideas on my platform that focus on improving resources for students. My first is to extend the walk in-hours/availability of CAPS. I believe this is important because the health and wellbeing of students should be a top priority for the university and I believe we can do more to help students in a timely manner. I also want to collaborate with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and the EVPLA to work on how we can extend busses and provide more frequent busses to Isla Vista because a lot of students can not afford bikes and the bus is their main form of transportation. Many students rely on the 27 bus to take them to campus and because they run so infrequently and are smaller busses, a lot of students are not even able to get on a bus or have to wait long amounts of time to catch a bus. Another item on my platform is providing free menstrual products in lecture hall bathrooms and in places around Isla Vista such as the Pardall center, IV and Embarcadero Hall, and the Isla Vista Community Center. The next thing on my platform is combating food insecurity by providing more meal vouchers to residents of Isla Vista and working with Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary enterprises to work on allowing students to bring take-home storage containers to help combat food insecurity and food waste. I also want to implement a Mental Health, Sexual and Gender Diversity, and Cultural Diversity, training for incoming first-years and university employees in order to help promote a more inclusive environment for all students. Finally, I want to establish a quarterly AS-wide Town Hall as a forum for open discussion with the student body. Mandatory attendance of all senators and executives would be required in order to hold the accountability of elected officials. I would also like to extend the invitation to boards, committees, and units (BCU) chairs to encourage them to share what they are working on and what we are doing to collaborate together. I know A.S. has a connotation as being inaccessible to the student body so I want to encourage transparency and space for feedback from students in order to better serve them.","I hope to work with multiple organizations and entities to help achieve my platform. I believe we have strong organizations that already do a lot for students and should be recognized and collaborated with in order to provide more beneficial services to all students. I hope to work with the Period Chapter at UCSB, The Women’s Center (WGSE), Commission on Student Well-being(COSWB), and the Residential Hall Association (RHA) to collaborate on ways to get menstrual products in campus lecture hall bathrooms and in non-binary bathrooms around both campus and in Isla Vista. I also hope to work with the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) to help combat food waste in dining commons by working with Housing, Dining, and Auxillary enterprises to allow students to bring their own food storage containers to help combat food waste and food insecurity. I also hope to work with CAPS, Student Commission on Racial Equality (SCORE), Queer Commission, the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), and the Resource Center Sexual & Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to help create a curriculum for first-year students and UC employees to better support the student diversity reflected on this campus and to inform and provide a sense of inclusion for all incoming students current students.","If the shift to online courses continues through summer and fall quarter, I would host Zoom office hours each week to make myself available to my constituents. My constituents would also have my email to contact me at any time. I strongly believe that during this time, we as a student body should support each other and be a resource to one another in the best way that we can, whenever we can. I would also encourage my fellow senators to collaborate on a group Zoom call once a month that would be open for the student body to join. They would be able to voice their concerns and ideas to us. We would also relay information to our constituents on what we will be working on to continue to support and provide resources for students. I would love to introduce myself in Zoom lectures as a way to reach out to different students. Some constituents that would be difficult to reach are the students who do not have equal access to technology or internet access and I want to advocate on their behalf as well and be able to address their concerns. I strongly believe the university must do something to help students who do not have equal access to the internet or to technology that would give them resources to allow them to be successful at this university.","I believe I am the best candidate because I am ambitious, hardworking, and am well qualified for the position. When I was younger, my dad told me a quote that continues to motivate me today; “you’re not smart, you’re hardworking.” I work hard and do everything to the best of my ability. I am committed to the student body because I am committed to making a difference and helping all students succeed and attain the resources they deserve. As a daughter of immigrants and as a Latinx woman of color, I have been disadvantaged many times in my life, but I chose to overcome those struggles and work hard to be where I am today. My parents worked hard to allow me to be where I am today and I want to be the change I wish to see in the world, and it starts here at this university. I care very much about our campus community and believe that caring about the UCSB community is very important when it comes to leadership roles. This is reflected in my job as an RA and knowing important resources and ways to better serve our community. I have had multiple leadership experiences and am excited about helping students. In my daily life, I practice activism by advocating for students and working hard to do my best for others. I am a devout public servant and this is what I enjoy doing. I know I can help make this university a more inclusive and resourceful place for all.",Left-leaning,"Good; I think the 70th A.S. Senate did a good job in addressing the needs of the student body because they passed several resolutions such as one to reissue UCSB as a sanctuary campus and also a resolution to defeat the stigma on mental health and better support undergraduates. However, I do think a lot more student-issued bills could have been passed such as actual solutions to problems like a way to help with the stigma on mental health. As a senator, I will follow my campus-based resolutions up with bills that promote action surrounding the issue.","Yes; I would vote in favor to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement because I strongly believe that any company that profits from the violation of human rights should be condoned. The violations that Israel has perpetuated and allowed against Palestinians are not acceptable and A.S. should join other undergraduate ASUC’s to align with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. The UC system should rescind it’s funding and place it towards initiatives that address student needs like Basic Needs. ","Yes; I believe that UCSB should be tuition-free because everyone should have the opportunity to get a higher education regardless of their socioeconomic standing. The fact of the matter is, that in these times, a college degree is very valuable for the workforce. No one should be prevented from an education and the high cost of tuition is hard on certain people. UCSB should be helping its students succeed and free tuition would be the first step to better helping us students. The UC was always meant to be tuition-free and must return to that model. ","I do not believe that mental health services at UCSB are adequate. As a student that has sought help from CAPS, I can personally say that I had a bad experience. You can walk in for a brief assessment at CAPS which is good, however, you can only come in during a small window, and if you are not one of the first ones there, they won’t have any more space available. I had to go to CAPS three times before I could finally be briefly assessed. They also do not have enough therapists staffed. I know multiple students who have had to wait weeks, and even months to be seen. This is not acceptable because mental health is very important and if someone needs to be seen ASAP, it is important to see them. Furthermore, the clinical staff is lacking in people of color. I was unable to get a therapist I felt comfortable with because I hoped to have someone who was Chicanx to better understand me and my culture, but that did not end up happening. I also know they only have one psychologist for international students, one of our biggest UCSB populations. It is not acceptable that the diversity of the CAPS clinical staff does not reflect the diversity of the student body it is supposed to serve. There is already a stigma around mental health, and part of breaking that stigma is seeing people like you, that have problems like you, and especially people like you to help you. CAPS needs to hire a more diverse clinical staff and make more availability to students. That is why on my platform I have the plan to help increase the walk-in hours for CAPS in order to fit more students. It is unacceptable that so many students have to wait a long time and feel turned away because our university is not providing enough resources.","I definitely believe that the university could have handled the situation better. It took a long time for the university to address this issue and while things were still being addressed, the fraternity in question was still allowed to continue to participate in Greek life events. While I do not believe the entire fraternity should be penalized for certain member’s actions, I do believe the fraternities should have been held responsible and should have held the member/s accused accountable as soon as possible. The university sent us out an email on October 28th stating that the day before the incident occurred and not much was done until the next following weeks. The IFC (Interfraternity Council) determined the consequence for themselves, the fraternities, to place a moratorium on all social events. There was no direct action from the university and the students were left out of the loop and confused and worried about the situation. The failure to communicate clearly from the university left many students frustrated. The only thing that I know of that is being done is a “Task Force for Safer Social Events” which is trying to bring change, however, the moratorium was lifted and socials occurred once again.","I do not believe Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Title IX is complicated and confusing and with the soon to be added rules from Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, it puts the survivor in an uncomfortable position should they choose to go through with the claim by placing them in cross-examination with the perpetrator. As an RA, I was trained in Title IX briefly, and I can say it is in fact confusing. The system is flawed and can often be very discouraging to survivors because it can be confusing and long. The new added laws will also redefine harassment and make it more narrow scoped, which also turns away survivors. This system is not adequate in addressing sexual assault on UC campuses and needs to be more survivor-oriented. It disadvantages survivors who have a lack of resources whether it is financially or emotionally.","I do not believe UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups. Over the years, UCSB has made steps towards becoming more inclusive towards these communities, however, I believe the university can do better. One thing that I instantly noticed at UCSB was the lack of diversity in the faculty. I know that, for example, the department I am in does not have many professors of color. The diversity of the professors and instructors who are teaching us does not reflect the diversity of the student population. This includes sexual and gender diversity. For example, UCSB has an out list for faculty members who identify with the LGBTQ+ community and there are very few faculty who are on the list, once again not reflecting the student body. I believe that diversifying faculty is essential in order to better serve these underrepresented communities because then they would get some representation. This is just one way the university could dedicate itself to truly serving its entire student population.","If elected to serve on the Senate, the first resolution I would pass is a resolution to work with CAPS and Student Health to extend their walk-in hours/availability for students. I have heard the frustrations of many of my peers and have felt them firsthand. It is hard for a student to be seen at Student Health because it takes a while to make an appointment. Also for walk-ins, you have to often wait a while to be seen. For CAPS, it is unfair that the walk-in hours are so narrow and that if you can not go right when the walk-in hours start you can not be seen. This is important because the health and the well-being of students is important and should be a priority for the institution. It is hard enough for some people to seek help and then when they go seek it, there is no availability. I will work with fellow senators to make sure we do something to address this problem because it is not acceptable.","My job as a senator would be to not only advocate on behalf of the student body but to also be transparent with them and listen to what my constituents have to say. In my platform, I talked about how I wanted to have a quarterly AS-wide Town Hall as a forum for open discussion with the student body. This would require the mandatory attendance of all senators and executives in order to hold the accountability of elected officials. During this town hall, we would allow for students to voice their concerns or ask any questions regarding what we as senators would be doing together for students. We would advertise this town hall to inform students about this. I also think it would be a good idea to create social media platforms such as an A.S. Senate Twitter or Instagram in order to tweet bills passed and allow for UCSB community members to DM us for concerns in order to come off as less intimidating and to show that we really value the opinions of our constituents.","The priorities of the next UC President should be dedicated to the benefits of the students and not the institution. We saw how Janet handled the protest of UCSC’s TA’s who were striking for COLA(cost of living adjustment). She condoned the firing of the TA’s and made no progressive strides towards granting COLA or even engaging in a negotiation. With the COVID-19 crisis occurring currently, our striking here at UCSB got cut short as we were told that campus was closed and classes were moved to remote instruction. The new UC President should work to give COLA to the graduate teaching assistants who work hard to help the professors and us, the undergraduates, while also being students themselves. Another top priority for the next UC President is to stop the construction of the telescope on the mountain Mauna Kea as it is disrupting and violating the sacred culture of the people on the island. Finally, the next UC President must work towards making UCs more accessible to any student that wants to study at a UC. They can do this by making the UCs tuition-free or at least lessening the cost. The University of California system prides itself on being the center for research and education, but would not be able to achieve all that it has without its students and workers. The UC system receives much of its funding from donors and should be able to at least lessen the cost while maintaining the services and jobs that it provides. The UC President is supposed to serve the students and the next UC President should be devoted to the students.",,,,,,,
Angel Diaz,sofia,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Angel-Diaz.jpg,,He/They,2nd,Film & Media and Chicana/o/x Studies minor in Theater: Production and Design,,,"I want to be the representation needed in the upcoming senate. As a low income queer latinx first generation working student, I believe a lot of my needs have been dissmissed due to underrepresntation of my identities on the senate. For me, becoming senator next year means that I will be able to represent and showcase support to the many underrepresented communities off campus and on campus. Many of these communities and identities have not been given the necessary resources and safe spaces that are needed to succeed in a top tier university like UCSB.
I am running to be a senator because I am done waiting on a response on the issues that I face day to day. I am done waiting on the school to solve the constant events of sexual assault and hate crimes occuring off campus. I am done waiting for the voices of my constituents to be heard. Because I am tired of waiting, I have decided to run to be senator so that my peers and I no longer have to wait. Becoming senator, I would have the ability to not only speak and be heard, but to take action on these issues. I am running to be next year's senator because I want to make a difference in the college experience for the current and future UCSB students.","Within my two years of being at UCSB, I have achieved to become Marketing/External
Chair for the Queer and Trans Latinx Organization, La Familia de Colores and a member of Theta Nu Kappa Multicultural and Academic Fraternity Inc. These are two organizations who are very distinct from one another, yet I have gained the same knowledge of becoming a leader from both. They have taught me not only to be a leader who leads, but one who knows how to communicate, listen, and work with others.
La Familia de Colores is an organization that creates an open and safe space for latinx queer and trans identities on campus. Although this organization had been part of UCSB for almost a decade, the organization stopped functioning for almost two years. This year, I, along with the rest of the board and none board members, have worked on reopening this organization
that served as a home for many. Throughout this year, we have worked on creating weekly meetings, events, and workshops that help create the needed safe space for our shared identities.
As marketing/external of the organization, I have also worked on bringing as many individuals who identify with these identities into our safe space. I truly work on reaching out to queer and trans latinx identities looking for a Familia where they can be accepted, loved, and protected. In less than a year, La Familia de Colores went from having fifteen to thirty members coming to our weekly meetings. Additionally, not only do we interact in person, but we connect with over one hundred individuals throughout our social media platforms. With less than two quarters in the works, La Familia has become a small club to an official registered OSL organization.
With the hard work and dedication I have given to these organizations and the knowledge and experience I have gained from them, I am prepared for the challenges it takes to be a senator. I am ready to face the many difficulties that come from being a senator. I might not have the answer to every issue right away, but I have the ability to take the necessary measures to find one.

","A main issue that is constantly addressed by UCSB students is the financial burden of being a college student. While in office, I will introduce a resolution that allows for immediate and uncomplicated emergency grants for students facing financial difficulties. Although my number one objective is for an adjustment in the living and tuition cost of the university, yet, this is an issue that takes time to tackle. Thus, my immediate solution is to provide these efficient emergency grants that do not require an excessive amount of proof and can be given to a greater number of students.
Secondly, I will introduce a resolution or bill that holds perpetrators of sexual assault and hate crimes accountable for their actions. In the past, specifically this year, the school has taken a passive approach towards these constant horrific events. We have allowed for these attacks to become easily done because there is no serious punishment given to the perpetrators and their actions. As senator my priority is the safety of students and to stand with survivors. This new bill or resolution will make a change in the community we live in, it will no longer take a passive approach to these attacks.
Lastly, I will introduce a resolution that allows for students to obtain five meal vouchers per week. As of right now, off-campus students are only granted three meal vouchers a quarter, which becomes very limited for the eleven weeks of the quarter. Day to day many UCSB students face food insecurity, yet at the end of the day the dining commons are throwing entire bins of food away. This resolution will help reduce food insecurities within students.","My objective is to adjust the living situation and cost students face while living in Isla Vista. I want to be able to tackle the price of housing in Isla Vista because we pay too much for the poor housing conditions we are exposed to. In order to efficiently make a change in making affordable housing in Isla Vista I will work alongside Isla Vista Tenants Union, External Vice President for Local Affairs, and Santa Barbara County. Working along with these entities will allow me to have further information on how to tackle the high cost of living in Isla Vista. Adjusting the living situation of students is also about providing resources for them. Running as an off-campus senator, I am looking forward to creating a change within the living situation we are pushed to be in. My goal is to work with other organizations and entities in order to bring this change for my fellow UCSB students. As I mentioned before I would like to introduce a resolution that reduces food insecurities for off campus students. This resolution would provide students with five meal vouchers a week with no additional cost on their BARC account.","As mentioned previously, my goal is to specifically work and collaborate with Isla VistaTenant Union, the External Vice President for Local Affairs, and with county supervisor, Joan Hartman. In order to make this change in our housing situation, these are three great entities that will allow me to find the solution for this issue.The Isla Vista Tenants Union is an organization that has been constantly advocating and fighting for tenant rights. By working alongside them it will allow me to achieve my platform as I believe these adjustments are a mutual goal for both of us. Working with me will be beneficial as they would be able to provide me with the resources and knowledge needed to make these adjustments possible.
","COVID-19 has and continues to significantly affect the living situation of many. In hopes
for this to end, I believe I need to be prepared to take the necessary measures if this situation continues on to summer and fall quarter. If summer and fall quarter become online, I would be available to my constituents through social media, email, and by creating two to three weekly zoom office hours or by appointment.
For me, I am a person who prefers one-on-one physical conversations, however these drastic measures drive us out of our comfort zone in order to do what has to be done. I understand that online availability is not as efficient, however I will be as flexible as possible in order to accomodate my constituents with any help needed. As senator, I will do the required work to make myself the most available to my constituents.","By being part of different organizations and getting to know several individuals throughout my two years here, I have obtained the necessary information that grants me the opportunity to know what my constituents need for a better college experience. I am aware of the resources and protection that Queer and Trans individuals need. I am aware of the struggles that WOC, POC, First-generation, and Low-income students face everyday on this campus. I am aware there needs to be a stop on the passive approach that the school takes on sexual assault and hate crime. I am the best candidate because I have the required work ethic, dedication, and leadership to get the job done. I am the best candidate because I am not afraid to fight for what is needed for my constituents and I. I am the best candidate because I have the passion and commitment that other candidates do not have.",Left-leaning,"Very good; In comparison from last year , there have been several improvements from A.S. Senate. Their work on supporting sexual survivors and working to make UCSB a sanctuary campus are a few of the student’s needs that A.S. Senate has addressed. The progress they have done throughout the year has been undoubtedly very good. However, in every space there is always room for improvement. Going into next year, I believe there should be more collaborative work done between A.S. Senate and the general student body in order to address more of the student’s needs.","Yes; Definitely, there has to be a resolution in divesting from those companies. We are a student body who emphasize diversity and inclusion, it would be hypocritical of us to continue
supporting these companies that profit from the violation of human rights. Instead, the UC should take the money invested and put it towards resources for students.","Yes; Higher education, in general, should have no price. The high tuition of higher education discriminates and puts low-income students in a disadvantage. Implementing a tuition-free university will set forth a progressive and diverse system in our campus. The California Higher Education Master Plan always meant for the UC to be tuition free and we should return to that.","As a student who struggles with mental health, I believe that UCSB has a lot of improvement to do within its mental health services. Yes, we have CAPS, CARE, and Health and Wellness, however the support becomes minimal compared to the thousands of students who struggle with mental health on this campus. The inadequacy of these centers becomes apparent when observing the lack of availability to assist students in a timely manner. There has to be an increase in specialists working in these departments in order to have efficient personnel to aid UCSB students. The university has an issue of doing the bare minimum in addressing and acknowledging the mental health issues of its students. The expensive fees we pay should be used towards the improvements of these centers. Our mental health and our well-being should be the number one priority of the university.","The university handled the situation very poorly, the lack of importance they gave to this unfortunate and horrible act was clearly seen. Not only did they fail to keep their students safe, but they failed in recognizing the survivors by not addressing the issue sooner. It is a situation that showcases the inadequate work ethic and the inability of the university to handle circumstances like the one that happend last Fall Quarter. Obviously, this should come as a learning experience for the university. Their priority should not fall on keeping the identity of an abuser hidden, their priority should be on acknowledging survivors and keeping their students safe from any harm.","It becomes obvious that Title IX is an inadequate system to address sexual assault. From previous circumstances, like last fall quarter, Title IX continues to showcase a failed system that poorly acknowledges the constant sexual attacks happening in our universities. Not only does it fail to recognize survivors, but it fails to hold perpetrators accountable for their violent crimes. In light of recent events, I believe there should be a system in place that makes the process of addressing the event much quicker. These are situations that should be handled with top priority.","I believe that the school has not effectively served all underrepresented communities, although I cannot speak for the communities I am not part of. However, being a member of the LGBTQ+ and Latinx community, I see very minimal support coming from UCSB towards these underrepresented groups. Although there are some resources and centers established for these groups, such as the RCSGD, El Centro, and the Multicultural Center, there are still improvements to be done within these spaces. At a disadvantage for being underrepresented on campus, the resources given do not become as efficient as the university believes. There should be an implementation of bigger spaces, more staff members for these centers, and a larger platform for these communities to be heard. There should be a shift in the way the school acknowledges the struggles of their underrepresented communities.","As senator, I plan to address and advocate for an adjustment in the living and tuition cost of the university. It is an action that will take time to process, as it is an issue that needs to be discussed and worked upon before any changes can be made.However, before those adjustments are made or implemented, a bill or resolution that I will work upon is in creating a faster and more efficient system in obtaining emergency grants. Not only will there be a better system, but there would be more opportunities for students to get these grants. These grants will be given without the need of an eviction letter or detailed documentation.These grants will serve to help students with food and housing insecurities.","I, as an average student, have not been able to easily access the works of A.S. throughout the year. It is a situation that many students on campus share as well. It most definitely is an issue that needs to be resolved and improved.
In order to keep the student body connected and informed with the new works, I believe that an app could be implemented. This app could have similar features as google drive, with different folders that contain updated information from the different departments of A.S. The app could also have a main page that has important dates posted constantly with having the option of getting notified. This app would serve as an entire drive that showcases updates with events, new bills, and resolutions.
Having one on one interactions with individuals becomes difficult to do and reaching through social media is not efficient. However, this app could become the main platform for UCSB and A.S. to reach students in a bigger group. The app can be promoted within the dorms and Isla Vista housing for students to be aware of it. Nevertheless, this app will help improve student interaction with the Senate and its works.","As an advocate for social justice, my priorities stand in creating inclusion and fighting for people’s rights. Janet Napolitano has entirely done the opposite of being supportive towards students demands. For the next UC President, we need an individual who actually works with students on resolving issues such as COLA for graduate students. We need a UC President that understands the disadvantages and struggles that several students face day to day. Someone that not only understands these struggles, but someone who will do the required changes to implement equity within every campus.",,,,,,,

I want to show that the UCSB body is very tired of patiently waiting.Becoming a senator will allow me to have that platform that is more accessible to studentscomplaints, ideas, or even just doubts! Working along with other individuals who only want tomake UCSB a better place for all is also another highlight of becoming a senator.

I am very passionate about social justice issues and that includeslocal UCSB social justice issues that may have been ignored in the past! I want to face thosechallenges and bring it to light.","I have been involved across many different communities on campus.

For example, the Wellness Vending Machine isoff-campus. I want to try to see if we can get one on campus in order to increase accessibility.Making sure people know that different resources exist within UCSB is what I want to helppublicize. I am also the founder and the president of Intersectional Feminists which is anorganization on campus that educates, stands in solidarity, as well as produces visibility tomarginalized groups. The work that Intersectional Feminists has been doing includes workingwith the UCSB community to understand their concerns to create different types ofdemonstrations, petition, social media education, or solidarity stand. This has taught me how towork with students and produce some type of response in return. Through both being a volunteerand the President of Intersectional Feminists, I have become a leader who stands on a platform inorder to elevate others voices, not my own. As Bernie Sanders says, “Not me, Us.”"," A bill to fund a wellness vending machine on campus
 A resolution condemning hateful transphobic, racist, homophobic, abeilist acts on campus

Eileen Tran,sofia,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eileen-Tran-2.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,3rd,Biology,,,My name is Eileen Tran and I am currently a Biology major at UCSB. I am running to be a senator to get more involved with school life and to be a voice and resource for others when they don’t know where to turn to but want to be heard. I think many students on campus have questions or need help but don’t know where to go or where to get this help. I plan on making myself as available as possible and being in the Senate will give me more access to make the changes I believe will benefit all of the gaucho community. I have many ideas that I am excited to share to improve campus life and life in Isla Vista.,"On campus I am involved with the Biomentor program at UCSB. This entails helping a group of sophomore Biology majors at UCSB with their MCDB classes. In the program they stressed to us the importance of not only being a tutor but being a mentor to help students in all aspects of their life. In addition, I am part of the UCSB Red Cross Club as part of the event planning committee to help organize fundraisers, blood drives, and volunteering events where all the money made goes back to the Red Cross Foundation. These experiences have taught me how to plan and execute an event as well as how to listen to general concerns and come up with the best way to help.","One of the platforms I am most passionate about is rent control in Isla Vista. After living in Isla Vista for 2 years, I’ve noticed from year to year rent prices are increasing making it hard for students to afford living close to campus. I hope to work with the Isla Vista Tenants Union to try to limit rent prices from increasing over 20% year to year to hopefully reduce any financial stress students are experiencing. In addition, I hope to create an off campus location for the food bank in Isla Vista to make it easier for students to access free food during the weekend since the on campus food bank is only open during weekdays. Also, I would like to expand the amount of meal tickets given out each quarter since much of the food in the dining halls end up going to waste. Lastly, I hope to expand study spaces to Isla Vista with Wifi access to make it easier for off campus students to have a quiet study space without having to go all the way to the library, especially since biking home late at night could make many students feel unsafe in their environment.","My platform entails doing everything I can to improve student life at UCSB. This entails creating a location for a food bank in IV to combat food insecurity for Isla Vista residents as well as allow for increased distribution of meal tickets, working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and EVPLA to establish a rent cap so rent can only be increased up to 20%, increasing affordable parking spaces on campus for those who have to drive to school, expanding Wifi and study spaces to IV and integrating other major insurance companies into student health. I also plan on getting imput from students to see their opinion on what resolutions they want me to work on.","I hope to work with the Isla Vista Tenants union to come up with a rent cap so leasing companies can’t increase rent prices over 20% year to year. In addition, I hope to make this organization more know to students living in Isla Vista so they know where to turn to when many landlords take a majority of the security deposit at the end of the year or when landlords refuse to fix essential items in the space.",I will make a personal Senate facebook and instagram page with my school email listed so that students can access me at any time through social media through direct/personal messages as well as holding online office hours.,"I am a very driven and hard working person so I believe being in the Senate will give me the ability to make changes I want to see on campus. I plan on prioritizing my time to listen to students' concerns to come up with the best resolution to solve their problems. I believe I can add diversity to the 71st Senate since all senators have a different group they can reach thus, having a large diversity is important to represent UCSB as a whole.",Left-leaning,"Good; I believe that the 70th AS senate has done a very good job at addressing student needs. Resolutions such as the resolution to defeat stigma around mental health, the bill to develop a basic needs resource center and the bill for book grants are all examples of how the AS senate has been working to improve student life. 
",I am not fully informed on the whole situation so I prefer not to answer until I am fully educated.,"Yes; I do believe UCSB should be tuition free so that students have access to high education as initially intended in the California Higher Education Master Plan. While student fees have served as the base for the resources our students need, I believe grants and scholarships should be expanded to support low income students”","I do not believe mental health services at UCSB are adequate. While we do have the CAPS program, most times appointments are filled up until a month later so students aren’t able to get immediate help if they need it. I think UCSB should expand the CAPS program by hiring more psychiatrists, therapists, and mental health peer advisors so more appointments are available to students. Also, the school should do their best to advertise other mental health programs on campus that most students don’t know about such as social workers, crisis hotline, and Student Mental Health Coordination Services so students have another place to go instead of just CAPS.",I believe the university could have handled the situation better. As a female student at UCSB I felt as though I was thoroughly informed of what was happening. In cases of sexual assault I think that the school should have responded faster to students’ needs and concerns as well as send out emails to the whole student body informing them of the current situation without releasing any private details about the parties involved. In addition I believe the school should make a greater effort to put together more support groups for sexual assault survivors so they have a place to to open up about their experience if they choose to do so.,"Title IX prohibits sexual discrimination at federally funded educational programs. As seen from this following year, there has been multiple sexual assault cases where the school has not been responding in an adaquate manner. In addition, Title IX only address sexual assault cases after it has occured, thus I believe the school can make a greater effort to put together support groups for sexual assult survivors to make it easier for them to cope after their experiences.",I believe UCSB has done its best to serve historically underrepresented groups however there is always more that could be done. When representing these groups it’s important to hear directly from them what changes they want to see on campus. I hope to attend some of their meetings to hear the opinions of all groups on campus so I can have a better idea of how to represent the community as a whole.,"As a senator I would like to work on a rent control bill/resolution to keep rent prices low in Isla Vista. Every year major leasing companies are monopolizing houses in Isla Vista, thus companies are able to increase rent prices every year causing a financial burden on students. Many students aren’t fortunate enough to get financial help from their parents, thus with high tuition rates and student fees this causes extra stress on students on top of their academic work. I plan on working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union to pass a bill preventing leasing companies from increasing total rent over 20% from year to year.","As a senator I would create an Instagram and Facebook page to inform students about what Associated Students are doing for the school. In addition, the page will have all senators office hours as well as their contact information such as their school email and possibly phone numbers. I plan to post a lot through my personal social media to let people know I am available at all times to listen to what they have to say.","Top priorities for the next UC president should be focused on how to deal with the ongoing coronavirus situation and how to transition students back from remote instruction to in person instruction and how to help students who are having any financial troubles due to the economic recession as a consequence of the pandemic outbreak. In addition, I believe the COLA movement needs to be addressed because the strike was interrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.",,,,,,,
Emanuel Roman,holly,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Manny-Roman.jpeg,,He/Him/His,3rd ,Sociology & Feminist Studies,,,"I decided to run as an Off-Campus senator because I believe in the power of
change and that such change occurs within the students. As someone who is apart
of multiple marginalized and misrepresented communities, I felt it was imperative
to further the change occurring.
○ As a third-year, I have witnessed many subtle and blatant injustices on and
off-campus, with minimal action on behalf of the administration and of those who
represent us. I was compelled to demand that things improve, not for the sake of
this university, but because student lives depend on it. About half of the students
at UCSB are food insecure. What is UCSB doing about this? When it comes to
the lives of Trans* and Queer people of color, what are the campus and its
administration doing to protect and support their livelihood? I believe
accountability and action are what is going to create such change.","During my time here at UCSB, I joined multiple orgs on campus that allowed me to feel
comfortable and accepted on campus. In my second year, I served on A.S. Queer
Commission as Outreach Coordinator, and am currently serving as the Vice (Pride)
Co-Chair. As Pride Co-Chair, it is my duty to demonstrate the fact that LGBTQ+ folk
exist on this campus and the fabulousness of it. I also am the Educational Coordinator of
A.S. S.C.O.R.E. (Student Committee on Racial Equity). My position entails holding
workshops and other informative programs that display and uphold ethnoracial issues on
campus, how we can improve the livelihoods of these racial groups, while also showing
student-accomplishments over the years.","Three resolutions I would like to introduce while in office would be
● A resolution that battles food insecurity at UCSB. Seeing that about half of UCSB
students are food insecure, this is something that UCSB needs to deal with on a
greater scale.

● A resolution that promotes deeper involvement of international students. Since
international students make up a big portion of the student population, they also
need proper representation and visibility; whether that is increasing funding,
grants, promoting clubs and organizations; and supporting them academically,
too.
● Encouraging a once-a-year grant (per student) that they are allowed to utilize in
case their bike or skateboard is stolen. This grant would allow (up to a certain
amount) the student to purchase a new bike, without adding any more financial
stress onto them.
","○ INSTALLING ​emergency- lights stations around IV. It can provide temporary relief for those who need it.
○ WORK ​with the office of the President and the Transportation & Parking Services (TPS) to configure cost-efficient solutions of on-campus parking for students.
○ EXPAND​ the Metro Services by working with Santa Barbara MTD to allow those off-campus more ​efficient​ and ​quicker access​ onto campus, without worrying whether the buses are too full. By reinstating a bus exclusively for those from San Catalina/Sierra Madre/San Joaquin, it will allow them to utilize those buses while giving room for those in IV to use the 24X, 15X, 11 and 27.
○ REINFORCE ​a Resource Center that provides brave spaces for survivors of sexual harassment and sexual violence (SHSV).
○ UNITE​ with the RCSGD, EOP, Food Bank, and the Financial Crisis team to create easier and more tangible access to provide more meal-tickets for those in need.
○ INTEGRATE​ with the Isla Vista Housing Crisis Coalition with the Isla Vista Tenant Union to help lower the overall costs of rent in Isla Vista and hold these property managers accountable.
○ COLLABORATE​ with A.S. Bike Shop to provide a once-a-year grant (ex: Stolen Bike Grant) that will allow a person to choose a bike of their choice from what is available.
"," I plan on collaborating with the Office of the President; EVPLA; TPS; Santa Barbara MTD, the RCSGD; EOP; Food Bank; Financial Crisis Team; Women,
Gender, and Sexual Equity Center; IVHCC; IVTU; CAPS; CARE; AS Bike Shop,
and more.
○ These organizations and entities are vital resources on campus, but ones that need
expansion and more funding/visibility. By working together, we can fulfill the duties in which they were created.","As someone who is online pretty often, I will definitely make myself available. I will be holding office hours throughout the week via Zoom, but also available often via Email. If my constituents are unable to do so, I am also available through social media.","I am someone who is completely and whole-heartedly passionate about what I believe in. I do my best to achieve every goal, and even when I am unable to do my best, I pick myself up and keep going. I genuinely want to make a difference and create change on and off-campus, and I am willing to put the effort to learn and do so.",Left-leaning,"Good;The 70th A.S. Senate has done good work, but not enough. There needed to be more advocacy on behalf of those who’s platforms resulted in their election. I believe Senators, just like anyone else, need to be held accountable and make sure they’re doing their job at the best they can to their abilities.
","Yes;Since I am in support of liberation for all people, I would support divestment legislation. The topic of divestment is a highly complex one and we all need to educate ourselves on the topic before making a definitive answer. However, let it be clear: I am absolutely against any and all forms of anti-semitism, as well. We all need to acknowledge the struggles the Jewish community faces and support them, too."," Yes; I believe this institution and the entire UC system, have the means and funds to be tuition-free.","I believe that UCSB has a foundation, however, I do not believe mental health services are adequate enough. This is not to say that CAPs/CARE is not doing a good job, but with the number of students at UCSB, there simply are not enough resources. If a student is seeking therapy, counseling, or just to speak to a professional, there is typically a 2-3 week wait. This is ridiculous. I get it, there simply are not enough professionals available to assist everyone. But if time-and-time again, mental health has proven to be a dire situation, this university should look into expanding and funding these resources accordingly.","● I absolutely believe that this university could have handled all situations better. The justifications are that the administration simply was unaware of the assaults since it mainly goes through UCPD. However, even in light of the situations, there seemed to be minimal action from the university.
● Reports of sexual assault and other forms of assault occur often and almost every year. How is the university, and the Inter-fraternity council (IFC) handling these situations accordingly? It goes beyond the individual, but into the systems that continue to allow and perpetuate these situations.","Title IX has great intentions and was created to support those who were discriminated against during the times of its creation. Title IX also covers a myriad of cases. However, when it comes to sexual assault, there is an extensive and tedious process that occurs. Many of the times, this dissuades the survivors from coming forward, for it not only puts them in uncomfortable positions, but it also overlooks the capacity of the survivor. Many survivors are unable to come forward right away, and so they most likely did not receive a sexual assault forensic exam. This can delay the process.
● That is only one example. I believe that Title IX needs to improve its system in addressing sexual assault, first by centering and listening to survivors.","I believe that UCSB is moving in the right direction in relation to serving historically underrepresented groups. As a queer, Latinx, first-generation student, there have been spaces that I involved myself that allowed me to feel comfortable and accepted. However, while these spaces might be available, there seems to be a misdirection of equity. Funding for these social spaces and organizations lack when compared to the predominant organizations and groups.
● There needs to be much more funding, visibility, and representation when it comes to these marginalized groups on campus. It goes beyond diversity, but actually including
these groups into these conversations, and making sure they are given the platform to do so, and are actually listened to.","One of the bills I want to pass, in collaboration with other senators and administration, is providing proper physical campus space for those in need. The facility for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD); The Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Center; CARE; CAPS; etc. By expanding these centers, it will allow for growth, healing, prosperity and for students to prevail.","For one, improving the website. It can be very inaccessible, and minutes for every A.S. entities are not always updated weekly or quarterly. Two, collaborating with student organizations. The student involvement is extremely high, and by merging with student organizations off and on-campus, it will demonstrate that although we are senators, we are also students.","Top priorities for the next UC president would, ideally, be someone who centers students and workers first (both undergraduates and graduate students). With COLA going on at this very moment, and the shameful actions on behalf of President Napolitano and UCSC Admin, it is clear that the lives of students are not being prioritized, but rather deemed as commodity and profit.
● The next UC President should encourage and promote an increase of the amount of grants/scholarships for incoming students, but also for ongoing students. They should prioritize UC workers, especially those whose jobs are undermined and overlooked (e.g. the AFSCME 3299 union).",,,,,,,
Andy Arciaga,holly,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Andy-Arciaga.jpg,,​she/her/they/them,3rd, Psychology & Brain Science (with a minor in Applied Psychology),,,"I am running as your next Off-Campus Senator because I believe I am able to make meaningful, tangible changes. I consider myself to be very fortunate, like most of you, to be here at UCSB where I feel like I belong for the first time. As a transfer student, it was very daunting for me to move into a brand new and unknown world, but I have been warmingly welcomed by communities here that do not exist in the small town where I came from. The students and friends that I interact with inspire me to take on the challenges and victories that come with being a senator. AS Senate leads in changes that we want to see and has the power to make decisions that impact us. I am passionate in making our school a community that welcomes all identities, creates safe spaces and resources for all, and fosters both academic and personal excellence. I am motivated to advocate for and serve students at all levels. I want to be a part of the change that makes our school greater than it already is, and I won’t wait for someone else to do it. I am here, and I am ready and willing to take on the job.","I’m a member of Kapatirang Pilipino’s (KP) Political Committee. My involvement with the committee, and the club in its entirety, has taught me the importance of understanding the effects of intersecting identities on finances and access to resources. Intersecting identities are never independent of each other. It creates multiple sources of disadvantages. As of 2020, UCSB is the fourth most diverse UC college, but I still feel like there aren’t enough resources that recognize the unique experiences of our diverse student body, especially on identities that overlap. We can’t expect students to excel academically and personally when substantial resources that help and support them are not accessible or don’t exist at all. I am also a student staff at the Pardall Center, where I interact and engage with students of UCSB and community members of Isla Vista. Despite our brief interactions, I understand the struggles of both populations, especially students who have issues with their landlords. This unique experience makes me especially equipped to hold the position as an Off-Campus Senator because I understand their struggles and can effectively advocate for them and their needs. Through Kapatirang Pilipino and as a student staff at Pardall Center, I have been exposed to various issues students face on a daily basis. This shaped my platform of what
    
I think UCSB students need and deserve, and I believe I am that person that can help
them achieve this and more.","The first bill I plan to introduce is regarding mental health services. I believe CAPS can be a greater resource if we expanded what they can offer. By working with other entities, like AS Public & Mental Health Commission and Commission on Student Well-Being, I hope we can increase the number of clinicians available and bring CAPS in Isla Vista. I would also want clinicians who specialize specifically in dealing with issues of underrepresented groups, like the LGTBQ+ and Black community, and clinicians who are specific to first years and transfer students. I also would like to introduce a bill that makes course materials affordable, collaborating with AS Book Bank to make this happen. Textbooks, course readers, and test materials are essential in our learning process. They are required by most, if not all, courses offered at UCSB. Students already face difficulty in paying for other expenses, like housing and food. They shouldn’t have to be burdened by the additional cost of course materials. Switching to open educational resources, like the textbooks some of us are using this Spring quarter, is just one step towards that bill. Lastly, I plan to introduce a bill and work with the EVPLA office to help solve the housing issues in Isla Vista. Working at the Pardall Center, I have seen students come in time and time again for the same issues. Students, and no one in general, should have to experience landlords abusing their power. We need to hold them accountable for their wrongdoings and lack of attentiveness to their tenants’ needs like overcharging their tenants and the lack of attention to the molding issue.","I am a big advocate for resources! I know a few people, including myself, have had a hard time being accommodated at CAPS. Students believe that the wait line is too long and most times appointments are not scheduled until weeks later. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and we should make this equally accessible for everyone. These are a few reasons as to why one of the first bills I plan to author revolves around mental health services on campus, focusing on CAPS. I also plan on working with the Food Bank to move into Isla Vista and creating and/or increasing resources for marginalized identities and transfer students. Examples of the latter would be food and financial literacy, CLAS specific for transfer students, clinicians who specialize in issues and culture of marginalized identities, and more assistive technology for disabled students. I also want to help students in Isla Vista by working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union to resolve housing issues, such as communication and the power dynamic between landlord and tenants. I will make myself available to anyone as much as I physically and mentally can. I want to be transparent in the things that I do and the plans
that I have. Working closely with organizations, entities, and students will ensure that
students from all levels are represented and heard. No one gets left behind.","One of my platforms that I am most passionate about is resource accessibility. I want to bring CAPS and AS Food Bank in Isla Vista to make both resources equally accessible for students who are living off-campus. With that platform in mind, I hope to work with AS Public & Mental Health Commission, Commission on Student Well-Being, Zero Waste, and most importantly CAPS and AS Food Bank. I believe these specific entities are crucial in our ability in bringing on-campus resources in Isla Vista. I also want to increase resources for marginalized identities. For instance, implementing transfer students-specific CLAS, pushing for gender neutral bathrooms, and increasing assistive technology for disabled students. For these, I hope to work with Transfer Student Alliance, Commission on Disabled Equality, and Queer and Womxn’s Commissions, to name a few. I hope to work with them to support them on their on-going and planned projects and to help them in getting the resources they need. Lastly, I hope to work with other senators, both on- and off-campus, and Presidential candidate Daniel Segura. While we may differ in goals and ideals, we are here to advocate for and serve the entire student body, not just the select few we identify with. I hope we get to collaboratively work together and support each other in making a community that puts students first.","It all comes down to the specific rules enforced during summer and fall quarter. I will be living in Isla Vista for the next school year, so I would prefer, and want, to have in-person meetings. However, if shelter-in-place is still in effect, there are many resources online that I can use to make myself available. As old as I sound, emails are the first thing I check in the morning, so I would not have any problems missing any. For a more collaborative approach, we can substitute in-person meetings with online meetings through Zoom or Google Hangouts. While Zoom isn’t often reliable, with the possibility of crashing and Zoom bombing incidents, I am looking for a platform that’s highly secured and can easily be accessed. However, if messages or issues are time sensitive, I can be reached through text messaging apps like GroupMe or Flock. I am not an advocate for Slack, due to its investors whose beliefs I do not align with, and would prefer other forms of messaging communication. There are other resources that I’m not used to, but I’m great at adapting to new situations. Also, I am not only available to my constituents but to students as well. I want to be another source for all especially for students who might not know where to specifically go.","Because of my job at the Pardall Center, I am able to interact with various aspects of student life. This gives me an understanding of what students are satisfied and upset with and what students really need, which will allow me to effectively serve you as your next Off-Campus Senator. Before the opportunity of running even presented itself, I have been thinking of ideas and solutions that I believe would benefit many, if not all, of UCSB, which I hope to share with you and act on in the upcoming school year. This shows that I have been determined in serving the student body and making meaningful, tangible changes since day one. Also, as a queer, Asian woman who’s a transfer student, I have personally seen where the university fails and needs improvement, like many other marginalized students have. We are all equally deserving to have a seat at the table, and I know I am someone who is not afraid to speak up and fight for this belief. I am dedicated to ensuring that all identities are heard and represented and that the institution that you pay for effectively works for you.",Other: Progressive,"Good; A.S. Senate was able to work efficiently, which is reflected in Fall Quarter’s Bills and Resolutions. I’m satisfied with the bills passed. Though I wish some resolutions, specifically regarding destigmatizing mental health, were followed by bills.","Yes; I would vote for a resolution inline with BDS. We can’t continue to support companies that still have ties to Israel. Doing so makes us complicit in their crimes against Palestine. Instead of investing in international companies, the UC could put that money towards resources students need like mental health services, zero emission transportations, and open educational resources.","Yes;Higher education should be a right for everyone, not just the privileged few. In-state UCSB students pay about $15,000 for tuition and are still expected to pay for housing, food, and other essential school supplies. The California Higher Education Master Plan intended the University of California to be tuition-free and our state needs to reinvest in our students. Financial help does exist for those that meet the requirement, but sometimes that with loans and scholarships, there still isn’t enough money to cover other expenses. Students are then faced with other issues like food insecurity and homelessness. Instead, the money should go to support and improve the resources that we have on campus.","No, the mental health services on campus are not adequate. CAPS needs to be a lot more accessible. There’s a total of 8 CAPS locations, which are open for 38 hours a week. The availability isn’t sufficient considering the number of students that attend our school. First, they should be open past 4:30PM, especially on Wednesdays and Thursdays when they’re open at a later time. With extended hours, we should be hiring more clinicians as well. Second, certain clinicians should be assigned to first years, transfer students and non-traditional students. We should also add locations, or move existing locations, in areas with a heavy population of students like them. Adjusting to a new environment can be difficult, even for a transfer student like me. Having mental health support will help students in transitioning and support their academic success as well. Third, we should add another location in Isla Vista, besides the pre-existing one in Gaucho Support Center, since it’s where most students live and/or frequent. Pardall Center could be one of the spaces where clinicians can come in a few times a week to hold appointment-only sessions. These measures ensure that students who live in Isla Vista have the same access to CAPS as students who live on campus. Outside of CAPS, we should have a free subscription to Headspace, a guided meditation app, and an A.S. position, a senator or a seat on the Executive Board, that deals specifically with students’ mental health and well-being. Let’s cultivate a community that destigmatizes mental health and supports each other because mental health is just as important as physical health.","The university failed to properly deal with the situation. First of all, the university didn’t send out a Timely Warning until two weeks after the incident. From my
understanding, Timely Warnings are sent out as soon as information about an incident is received. Why did it take two weeks for the university to learn and address the incidents? Why did it take two weeks for the fraternity to report the use of date-rape drugs by one of their members? It shows that the systems in place, both in Greek life and in our university, are not efficient and need reformation. Additionally, the Timely Warning email contained victim-blaming rhetoric. Students were given “safety tips,” which further puts the responsibility of the situation on the survivor rather than the perpetrator. Doing so discourages the survivors from reporting and encourages acceptance of both victim-blaming and actions of the perpetrator. Furthermore, a temporary hold on social events and a task force that monitors safe practice were the only steps taken after the incidents. These are inadequate consequences. There should have been an increase in resources and open dialogue that’s readily available, not things students need to seek out for. There should have been concrete actions against the fraternities that ensured incidents like these are not acceptable and shouldn’t happen again.","Looking at events in our school in the past year, I don’t believe that Title IX is an adequate system in addressing sexual assault on UC campuses. The way our university dealt with the reports in Fall Quarter received a lot of outcry and demands from students. The incidents were not immediately reported. There was little to no transparency in the dialogues between the university and organizations involved. The process that followed the reports was slow, and all we got was a task force that monitors safe practice in social events. Also, I know students across UCs that have reported their experiences and were still forced to be in the same space as their assailants. These show that Title IX is failing in supporting and protecting its students, especially the survivors. UC has to add supplemental resources and laws to Title IX. UC has to create a better system that cultivates a safe space, especially for survivors, and a faster and rigid process that supports them. UC needs more transparency with situations like these. Sexual assault has no space in our community. It is not tolerable and should not only be punishable with a slap on the wrist. We deserve actions from UC that supports this and supports us.","No, but I believe UCSB has the ability to do better. There are spaces and resources, such as MCC, EOP, and RCSGD, that support underrepresented groups. However, I believe they don’t have the same opportunities and access to other resources, compared to other groups, outside these spaces. In UCSB’s 2019-2020 campus profile, 65% of admitted undergraduate students, excluding International students, are of non-White identities. Resources like mentioned above can’t accommodate the entire
population. I can’t speak on behalf of the communities of Black, Latinx and other ethnic identities, but I can speak on issues surrounding the Pan Asian and LGBTQ+ community. The Pan Asian community makes up 27% of the UCSB student population. Considering that number, there’s a lack of resources tailored specifically to us and the diverse, and sometimes intersecting, groups within the Asian community. For instance, the Department of Asian American Studies is one of the smallest departments on campus despite the large space we hold. There’s a limited number of faculty, with only eight core faculty members, and courses offered for both undergraduate and graduate students. Furthermore, the belief in model minority is detrimental to our identities and minimizes our mental health. We need clinicians in CAPS that specialize in Asian American issues. We need representation, in general, in UCSB’s paid staff that specialize in our issues and sociocultural contexts.​ ​There are many student-led organizations that are specific to the LGQBT+ community outside of RCSGD and QComm. However, we still feel like we aren’t welcomed in spaces in UCSB and Isla Vista. An example is an incident that occured in Fall Quarter 2019 where a UCSB student assaulted and used homophobic slurs on another student. The assailant was arrested, but he was later released on a misdemeanor and a few hundred-dollar bail. This is an unacceptable response to his actions. It shows that UCSB doesn’t care for and protect the LGBTQ+ community and that beliefs and actions like these are tolerable in our community.","If elected, the first bill I plan to author is expanding resources CAPS has to offer. I’m a big advocate for resource accessibility, and I believe CAPS has the potential to be better. We need to allocate a position in A.S. that deals specifically with CAPS and other resources for students’ mental health and well-being. This would be one of a series of mental health-centered bills I will author. I also want to push for a free subscription to Headspace, a guided meditation app. There are many advantages to meditation, such as reduced stress and improved energy and brain function. Meditating can be daunting and difficult at first, but I’ve found Headspace easy to follow and a maintainable habit. I also want to increase the hours of operation, clinicians available, and locations of CAPS. We need an additional location in Isla Vista to ensure that students both on- and off-campus have the same access to CAPS. Additionally, I will be advocating and fighting for clinicians who specialize in underrepresented groups, such as LGBTQ+, Asian, Black, and Latinx communities. I will also include assigning clinicians to first years and transfer and non-traditional students.","One of the most important ways we can include and inform the student body is through the Internet! I mean, we are in the Digital Age. Some classes run as late, sometimes even later, than 6:30PM. Students might have just gotten out of class or work and want immediate relief by going home. Most organizations hold their meetings this late in the day as well. Students already have the option to watch the Senate meetings online. We just need to promote it better. We can do this by sending weekly text or email reminders, setting up flyers in areas with the most foot traffic, creating a Digiknow, and posting on AS’s social media. Additionally, we should hold bimonthly reverse town hall meetings. This will give students the space to give feedback on the current state and decisions of the Senate and voice what they would like to see on our campus. I would also push for summarized agendas and meetings, supplemental to the current system they have in place, and a monthly recap that is on their website and is sent out to students. We also need to emphasize outreach, especially on first years and transfer students. As a transfer student, I haven’t seen enough information and involvement of the Senate in our community. Outreach will increase said populations’ awareness on who and what A.S. is and potentially lead to future A.S. leaders. Examples of outreach that we can do is targeting low turnout populations, increasing connections between the Senate and organizations, and increasing social media presence and activity. Students need to know that they are heard, represented, and served by people that have their best interest, which will encourage them in working with AS.","The next UC President’s top priorities should include climate change and students’ best interest. Zero Waste is one of current UC President Janet Napolitano’s policies. Her office projected that, by 2020, all UC locations will have their land fill diverted by 90%. It’s commendable that a large institution like UC is taking an initiative in creating changes in institutional levels. However, under Napolitano, individual UCs had the final say in implementing the policy. Leaving this power to UCs, rather than implementing it to all, leaves discrepancy in the effectiveness of the policy. Furthermore, zero waste isn’t only fighting climate change but food insecurity as well, which many college students face. We need a president that has concrete ideas in achieving zero waste and can implement these ideas. We also need a president that will always do right by students. This year’s monumental COLA movement is a prime example. Cost of living dramatically increases every year, making it harder for many, students included, in making ends meet. Under UC, graduate students are being exploited. They are not getting paid enough for the amount of labor they do. Instead of complying to the demands and supporting them, Napolitano fired most UCSC graduate students. Students shouldn’t have to put in situations where they’re forced to make drastic compromises on basic
necessities. Students shouldn’t have to be burdened by rent. We need a president that supports and serves us rather than punishes us.",,,,,,,
Connie Huerta,holly,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Connie-Huerta.jpg,,she/her/hers,3rd,Sociology and Black Studies Double Major with a minor in Spanish,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 71st senate because as a third year student, I have seen the sort of steps student activists have taken to create change on this campus. Although UCSB is always moving forward, that does not mean we as a campus are perfect. In fact, I can acknowledge there are still​ ​many areas that could use improvement. As a student who identifies with many marginalized and underrepresented communities on this campus, I have had the opportunity to get a sense of what groups could use more help and support, especially as our student body is constantly expanding and diversifying, causing campus demographics to change with that. The fact that I come from a low socioeconomic background, an immigrant household, am a first-generation college student, am a Promise Scholar, grew up with poorly funded public education, have felt the second-hand effects of ICE and the prison system, am a queer woman, all contribute to my individual experience and the sort of adversities my peers and I face, which consequently gives me a unique perspective. As a result, I try my best to be considerate of all communities and the way in which society views certain people, which inherently has repercussions on their experience that might contribute to even more layers of hardships as a marginalized student. Because of this, I hope to amplify the voices of these very communities that are constantly overlooked and neglected in order to ensure they have the resources necessary to succeed.","Throughout my time at UCSB, I think my involvement with various organizations
contribute to how prepared I feel to be an AS senator. I started off my involvement by attending conferences such as the Students of Color Conference my first year (as well as this year) and then the Empowering Women of Color Conference my second year. For my second year, this then led to my involvement with SIRRC as a mentor at local high schools, as well as having the opportunity to be Co-Outreach Coordinator with SCORE. For this school year, I was elected to be one of the Co-Chairs for SCORE, and finally had the opportunity to join Underground Scholars at UCSB, an organization I was eager to become more involved with after first hearing about their chapter at UC Berkeley present at the Students of Color Conference. Moreover, I also worked as research assistant with professor Mireille Miller-Young in the Feminist Studies Department Spring 2019, and a high school mentor for an English Learning Development class with School Kids Investigating Language in Life and Society (SKILLS) this past Winter quarter.
   
A specific project I started on during the winter with my position as Co-Chair was a Clothing Drive for students and the greater Isla Vista area by having an area with clean clothes at which people could donate clothes and accessories, or where people could feel free to take as many garments they wish, with complimentary refreshments. Apart from this, we would also donate leftover food we had to students or some of the houseless community in I.V. I would like to expand on this in efforts to work with both our student body and the greater IV community. Through all of this, I have continued to push myself outside my comfort zone, at which I was able to gain experience seeing what leadership looks like both on campus and off campus, all while learning more about the sort of ways in which people give back to their communities. As a result, I see the importance of community work, which is why I believe I have the right intentions in running for senate in efforts to take the knowledge I have gained on the way systemic issues affect different communities because the university as a whole has to show who they really care for by accommodating to every community’s needs appropriately. As senator, I would advocate for the communities that are historically disadvantaged due to the repercussions of the actions of those in power. It is time we listen to the voices of the communities that have been ignored despite being the ones to speak up the longest.","As senator, one of the first bills/resolutions I would like to implement and be a part of is the minimization of police presence on campus, as I do not find it to be an essential part of our education. Having police on campus only perpetuates the systemic disadvantages and discrimination society already places upon the same communities. If we truly care for our students, the prioritization of our education should not be presented through cops patrolling our university, but instead should be shown by providing resources for those who have housing issues, those who are food insecure, those who are worried about how they will afford their books and readers, etcetera. There are better ways to support the quality of our education than by insisting on having police present. Some other resolutions and bills I would like to introduce while in office include would be for topics such as, addressing the Human Rights violations occurring on the land of Palestine, as well as divestment from companies profiting off these violations. It is a shame that it has not been done yet and it is extremely disappointing that we are the only UC that has not decided to divest. Furthermore, I think it is important to address Chancellor Yang’s role in the construction of sacred land at Mauna Kea in Hawai’i. Hawai’i has endured enough by being taken over by the United States, and does not need anymore harm being upon their people, culture, or land. I would also like to pass a project that would allow students much more flexibility with meal swipes. Some changes include things such as allowing people to swipe for meals at non-dining hall locations such as the UCen or arbor, having meal swipes roll over, the ability to swipe students in, and being able to donate swipes whenever people decide to do so, instead of by a certain deadline every week.","My platform is to help provide basic student and community needs to those that could use
the support the most. This is because I understand the repercussions many experience due to the actions of those in power in this country. I do not think many people understand the various communities that are heavily affected by certain laws, policies, and ideologies the government implements. As a result, this leaves marginalized communities having to put in more work than others in efforts to survive through a world that was not made for them and does not have their best interest in mind. Although the system will not change overnight, that does not mean we should let it discourage us from seeking better resources or demanding our presence and hard work be acknowledged. We can begin on this campus by learning from the past and current mistakes of this country. In efforts to do this, I plan to work with and collaborate with organizations that also believe in change for this campus. Student activist groups at UCSB have shown exemplary leadership and dedication to making this place a better education environment and I admire them for that, therefore they should be receiving the utmost support as they are a representation of our student body. Some of these include movements such as the AFSCME UC Worker Strike, Undergrads 4 COLA, “A Rapist in your Path/ Un violador en tu camino” demonstration by MUJER, Sexual Assault Demonstration by Intersectional Feminist Club, and the work BSU put in to have more demands met from the orginal list of demands after the North Hall takeover in 1968. Furthermore, in order to be able to amplify the voices of the most underrepresented communities on this campus and what their exact needs are, I also plan to reach an even greater student body by actively listening to the needs of students at events such as town hall meetings. I want to consider everyone’s voices with their best interest in mind in order to figure out what steps should be taken to find solutions, rather than just state the issues without any sort of intention to mobilize change.","In order to achieve my platform and provide the support that is needed or
underrepresented communities on campus, I hope to work with student activist and community service oriented organizations that I would be able to work with to improve the environment on and off campus. Some of these organizations include but are not limited to: UCSB Student Activist Network, IV Tenants Union, Underground Scholars, Santa Barbara (USSB), Intersectional Feminist Club, La Familia de Colores, Mixed Student Union, and/or SCORE to work toward providing basic student needs. I know many of these organizations are already doing a lot of great work in order to provide in ways the system does not, which is why I feel like organizations like these should be more centered in discussions we have about our campus. In
order to better provide support for communities off campus, I would like to work with organizations such as: Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Mauna Kea Protectors at UCSB, La Escuelita, or Street Health Outreach. However, despite naming these specific organizations, I am open to more groups, as well as anyone and everyone who would like to work and collaborate in order to create a better overall UCSB campus. Every student led organization on this campus matters and I think it is essential to work closely with these groups that constantly work toward representing the student body, particularly those whose voices and concerns are often not prioritized.","Because of the current situation we are in with this global pandemic, everyone has had to
transition and get used to other means of work and communication. Although it would be ideal not to have to worry about aspects of life other than staying healthy, finding employment, paying rent, finding the means to get cleaning supplies, food, taking care of family, etcetera, school can become much more overwhelming than it already is. However, if this were to extend through summer courses and fall quarter, I would have to shift the form at which I plan to accomodate for the needs of students on campus by making myself as available I can to allow peers to contact me if they had any questions or concerns that should be addressed, as well as make myself a resource for my constituents to the best of my ability. I would use social media to advertise possible resources available, as well as making myself available through personal cell, video call, text, etcetera, through personal appointments or according to my office hours depending on my schedule. This way, students do not have to worry about contacting me solely via email, which can get a bit overwhelming and intimidating at times.","Because of the current situation we are in with this global pandemic, everyone has had to

However, there still has not been anything to address: how to incorporate more services for students, the housing crisis, the Chancellor funding construction on sacred land in Hawai’i, or efforts to accommodate for survivors of hate crimes within campus or surrounding campus.","Yes;Yes, I would be in favor of a resolution to divest from companies that profit from human rights violations in the current occupation of Palestine. It is disappointing to see that we are the only ASUC that has not taken these steps despite our education and knowledge of the country’s history. We have the ability to learn about what actually is occurring, yet it does not make sense to me as to why we have not addressed this already.","Yes;UCSB should be tuition-free in order to make higher education more accessible to all people. There is no reason as to why this opportunity should be for the economically privileged because learning is a right, and depriving certain groups from being able to learn is an abuse of power that comes with capital. There should be no restrictions, and education should not be treated as something profitable, but something all people deserve to have access to in order to grow individually to expand their own horizons.”","I do not believe mental health services at UCSB are adequate despite the changes
implemented throughout the years. There are not enough therapists working at CAPS, let alone sufficient representation of our student body. As a result, this affects individual relationships with the students and therapists. Another discrepancy I notice is how the high popularity of CAPS has resulted in a limited amount of visits students are allowed to make, leaving them with the options of only receiving minimal help, or continuing struggling as a student. Mental health conditions students might be experiencing will not be fixed with just a few meetings. If there are going to be such limitations, then the education system as a whole must stop the normalization of overworking its students and draining them mentally. Although some might come into higher education with pre-existing struggles, many people develop conditions that simultaneously hinders their ability to succeed in such a prestigious school. If they refuse to stop overworking college students, then there needs to be more of an effort to make sure there is an expansion of workers so there are enough therapists for all students ​with s​ ufficient representation. If a
 
marginalized student feels like they cannot relate to, or trust the current demographic of therapists that are accessible, it is resulting in the deprivation of resources for them, while increasing the ones for students who most likely already had sufficient access to helpful resources.","I do believe the university could have handled the situation better. This is because of the amount of time it took for them to send out a response, but also because of the lack of information in these emails. Not very much was said about the situation, which should be addressed because how else can we make sure we avoid this to occur again? Incidents like these do not just happen once and then go away, especially if they are aware they can get away with it. In addition, instead of making the fraternity holistically face consequences, there was a workshop for self-defense that was held for those who would be considered more ‘prone’ to this sort of assault. It made it seem like those that should take precautions ​should​ be those that are most scared of something happening to them, which is the complete opposite of what should be done. There is no reason for them to be the ones to have to take precautions out of fear because nobody seems to want to hold the assaulters accountable, which results in no sort of change. Instead, the same people who are experiencing all of this neglect and hardship, are basically being blamed for the actions of others.","I think Title IX has the right intention in wanting to address sexual assault on campuses
because of the way it attempts to protect people from discrimination on the basis of sex. However, the execution might be questionable. Most of the time, it seems as though the university tries to hide the situation by silencing the survivors and protecting the assaulters, resulting in a lack of transparency between the students. Depriving the student body of the information that is occurring within their peers and community is not exactly the right approach as this is something that we must discuss and is imperative we discuss. In addition, enforcing the fact that a police report must be placed is excessive, as that is not what all survivors want and it is not what they all need. The university also does not really make it clear what their steps are to hold these students accountable other than possibly telling the individuals to just avoid each other. Much of the time has zero effect on the assaulters, giving them the leeway to possibly
cause harm to others as well. Instead, since situations like this vary from case to case basis, they should be treated as such as well. There is no ​one w​ ay to address this issue since not everyone wants the same outcome. This meaning that some might not want to relive the experience, some might have reasons as to why they might not want to file a report because of the possible repercussions of going to the police could entail, etcetera. Not all survivors can be treated like they are the same person because they all have their own individual experiences, therefore I believe Title IX could definitely use some improvements, but we also need the universities to take the problem much more seriously.","I think UCSB has taken steps to better serve underrepresented groups on campus, but
many issues are still present. This is because the demands made by marginalized communities are more often than not perceived as, “asking for too much.” The changes that ​have ​occurred on our campus are thanks to the efforts and labor of community organizers and activists on campus. There could definitely be more support for these students, as marginalized communities have historically had so many resources deprived of them. A specific example of this can be with the demands that were made by students who organized the North Hall takeover in 1968 who had a list of demands for the university. Only a select few demands on the list were met, including the establishment of the Black Studies program, but it is unfortunate that Black students on campus are still fighting for more of these demands to be met. Although they have created amazing change and improvement, this is not something to praise the university for, but something the students ​should be praised for, as they are the ones in the forefront putting in all the work by demanding the university does more for students that are alienated, ostracized, and marginalized by society and this campus. The university could also use more implementation to better support students who are undocumented, indigenous, queer, genderqueer, etcetera.","If elected to serve on Senate for the 2020-2021 school year, the first bill I would plan to
author is one that addresses the police presence on campus. This is an issue I am very adamant about since I grew up in an area in which there was a heavy police presence in both middle schools and high schools. As a result, I have seen the harm police can cause both on campus and to the mental health of students, which inherently affects the value of education these students are receiving. As much as students already pay to attend this university, we must provide the safest environment possible and focus on funding student needs rather than police to patrol the
 
school. For a good amount of the student body, police do not mean safety but instead incite fear. Why would students want to attend a university that has police that reminds them that society perceives them as a threat which may inherently make them feel unwanted? Why must these students be forced to relive the traumatizing experiences our communities have endured and continue to experience? If safety is truly a concern, then we can replace the heavy police presence by having more CSO mediators, especially since these would be students working, not a group of people who have a history of misconduct against marginalized communities and experiencing little to no consequences for the harm they cause.","In order to involve the student body and keep them informed about what is going on with
their student government and bills/resolutions passed, the senate can become better accessible by utilizing social media platforms. This is because we know many students and organizations are using these platforms to post updates. In this way, we can use technology, something many students are heavily influenced by and use it to our advantage to make it another means of communication. This way, we can advertise what issues we are focused on which would simultaneously give students a better idea as to what else they would like to see from us for the improvement of our campus. In addition, we could send updates to our Boards Committees and Units, as well as the Office of Student Life organizations, as these are spaces that represent our study body and the various communities that make this campus amazing. As a result, by essentially keeping our student leaders well informed, they can also spread the message within their communities as well, to make sure we reach as much of our student body as possible.","Some of the top priorities for the next UC President is someone who, first of all, rehires
all the graduate students who have been dismissed and also meet the demands of the COLA movement, not just at UCSC, but ​all​ UC campuses. Secondly, we must prioritize an individual whose focus is on the quality of our education and not someone who sees the UC system solely as a business. The president of the UC should not earn their position because of the amount of money they have, but by looking at their intentions with their position, and how they will focus on constantly improving UC campuses. Another prioritization for someone who will be in charge of the UC system should be someone who cares for all communities and the basic needs of students (both undergraduate and graduate students). By doing so, they will make sure the
 
individual UCs would have adequate funding for certain things, such as more affordable education, and provide more resources for underrepresented UC student body needs in order for them to be able to thrive and succeed as a student. If student well being and retention is not something the following UC President cares about, then their priorities are not suitable to be the next leader and should instead seek a job elsewhere.

Rosey Lavery,sanya,L&S Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roseylavery.jpeg,,"She, her, hers",3rd,Communication,,,"I am currently running to be a senator with the 71st senate at UCSB because I have seen the dedication and passion that goes into these positions, and I want to bring the same qualities to this organization. I was lucky to be educated and involved with political movements from a young age thanks to my Dad. His job has required him to be very involved in local politics, and that led to my sister and I tagging along. Our involvement ranged anywhere from attending city hall meetings in San Francisco to being campaign volunteers for individuals such as current California Governor Gavin Newsom. It was because of this experience back home that I was excited to become involved in our own campus politics. 
Being a current Junior at our school, I have had the time and experience to become very familiar and immersed within both our campus and Isla Vista communities. UCSB has given me the chance to appreciate the great opportunities given here, but also experience aspects and services that need to be improved or implemented. As a senator, I want to be an advocate for the change and concerns students of all class standings, backgrounds, and identities want brought to the attention of the Senate. ","I have been involved with both my sorority and the Isla Vista Party during my time here at UCSB. My sophomore year, I learned about our school’s senate when a few of my friends chose to run for positions. After they told me about their platforms and all the teamwork that goes into campaigning, I knew that I wanted to be involved in some way. 
I volunteered to help them campaign in the time leading up to and during elections. From handing out fliers at the Arbor to reposting information on social media, I was there to support my friends and their goals through the entire process. Since their election, I have seen first hand all the hard work they put into their positions on and off the clock. After talking to my peers about their workload and ability to balance school work and senate, I am confident that I will thrive in this position. 
I know that I will be able to handle the workload and duties that come with being a senator because my previous experience has prepared me for it. Over the past year, I served as my sorority’s Recruitment and Marketing Vice President which taught me how to be a leader amongst my peers. My duties included multiple weekly and monthly meetings with advisors, chapter members, and the rest of our executive board. Our positions gave us the platform to make much needed change within our own organization, and I made sure to make as many changes as I could during my term. I want to bring that same mindset with me to the 71st Senate if elected. ","Considering the recent changes to our curriculum, there is going to be a lot of necessary work done by the 71st senate. If elected, my first resolution would be to ensure that all of the UCSB employees who were laid off or displaced by the Corona Virus have their jobs waiting for them once our campus reopens. The unemployment rate in our country has skyrocketed to numbers beyond that of the Great Depression in just a matter of weeks. The only way for the University to make a contribution to lowering these numbers would be to rehire their employees. From janitorial staff to campus restaurant staff, much of the non-essential employees during the lockdown have nowhere to work, but as soon as we return to what will be the new normal, there should be nothing stopping these organizations from rehiring the same individuals if they chose to return. 
My second resolution would be to stop the University from drastically increasing student fees to help finance COVID-19 related expenses and advocate for an increase in financial aid resources. The probability that the University could become financially displaced by the current pandemic is high, but the likelihood of students being financially displaced is much higher. As we continue into the future, it is our job to support the members of our community. Therefore it is the duty of the school to ensure that students affected by COVID-10 have access to financial aid resources to help them continue their education. 
My third resolution would be to finance a grant program specifically for situations such as the one COVID-19 has put us in. In order to take future precautions to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19 or any other contagions within our community, we should be providing the tools to do so and ensuring that we are prepared to fix the damage done. ","My platform has its foundation in my vision of expanding campus resources to better suit the current needs of our UCSB community. I would like to take steps to do this by collaborating with CLAS to expand one-on-one tutoring to Davidson Library and the University Center. Establishing workshops offered multiple times a year through each department in the College of Letters and Science to teach students specialized skills in their career fields is another vision that I am passionate about. Additionally, I want to implement a healthy habits movement with the help of CAPS during finals week each quarter. 
In order to keep this momentum consistent, I plan on constantly making small attainable goals that will help set the stage to achieve my long term goals. Making all of these visions a reality is going to take a lot of time and effort, but it is time and effort that I am willing to give. These aspects of my platform are just a few of the many resources on campus that are not reaching their fullest potential to meet the needs of the students on our campus. Students are struggling to teach themselves course materials, worried they don’t have what it takes to succeed in a career post graduation, and developing unhealthy study habits just to get through it all. Our university needs to hear these issues and do something to fix them, and I want to be one of the many people who will tell them that. 
","As mentioned above, I want to work with organizations such as CLAS, CAPS, and departments within the College of Letters and Science. Additionally, I want to also work with Associated Students to raise student awareness of the many resources they offer including the Food Bank and Book Bank. Each aspect of my platform requires me to meet and collaborate with leaders within each of these campus organizations. I thoroughly enjoy working on projects I am passionate about, and having the opportunity to meet with individuals who can aid me during the process is help that I am willing to take. ","During this stressful time, I know that every student has questions about how they will continue their education as we adapt to our continuously changing curriculum. From inconsistent communication between professors and students, varying lecture formats, waitlisting and crashing courses, our education is all over the place right now. If elected, my hope is to create some sort of consistency for students amidst all of this mess. 
I want to make myself available to students starting in the summer so that come Fall, senators will already have a list of needs from members of our community that we can start resolving. Whether it be over Zoom or through email, I want to have conversations with students about how we can meet individual needs and unique situations from home. By doing this, my hope is that I will be able to bring these concerns to department heads within the College of Letters and Science and work towards implementing solutions come Fall Quarter. ","I am the best candidate for the College of Letters and Science Senator because I have both the skills and the mindset needed to be successful in this position. My whole life I have been taught to be a hard worker, a problem solver, and a go-getter. These qualities have become a part of who I am, and I have utilized them to do good in any way I can. 
Whether it be playing on my lacrosse team in high school, participating in clubs, taking on a leadership position, or volunteering with local non-profits, I have always been involved in my community in various ways. Being involved in many organizations has taught me how to network, speak up for, and collaborate with members of my community. I know for a fact that these skills make me fit for the responsibilities that come with being a College of Letters and Science Senator, and I plan on utilizing them if elected to this position.",Left-leaning ,"Very good; The 2019-2020 school year has presented the 70th A.S. Senate with a variety of challenges and I believe they lived up to their duties as best as they could. The passing of resolutions to defeat the stigma surrounding mental health, to make UCSB a sanctuary campus, and to support the impeachment of Donald Trump are just a few of the resolutions passed that I stand with.  ",I am not fully educated enough on the situation taking place in Israel & Palestine to make an adequate vote on this matter at the time. The fact that this is such a serious decision requires one to be aware of the positives and the negatives of choosing to divest or not to. I plan to look further into the matter to do just that.,"Yes; While it would be much less of a financial burden on students for UCSB to be a tuition-free institution, our tuition is what funds many of the events thrown on campus and pays the salaries of our staff. Until the day comes that UCSB is tuition free, students must continue to pay tuition in order for the university to continue functioning the way it does, In order to support the students who at this time cannot afford our tuition, we must ensure that we raise awareness and continue to provide the financial aid and support that our university provides.","While I do believe there are adequate resources for mental health services, what is lacking is the access to these services. Students who are in need of urgent mental health services often find themselves unable to see a professional until 2-4 weeks later. We must first address the problem by hiring more staff at CAPS in order to open more appointment times for students. In addition, CAPS should begin hosting workshops on mental health education so that students are more aware of the signs that they might need professional help.  ","In a situation such as this, it’s the University’s responsibility to ensure all accusations are heard and investigated with all seriousness. As a woman at UCSB and a member of Greek life on campus, I can speak for many of my peers when I say it is our right to be informed of sexual assault accusations made within our community. At the same time, I do not need to know every detail within the case because we also want to make sure we are centering survivors. While the university should make students aware of where and when the event took place and investigate all accusations to the fullest extent, the majority of information should be limited to those involved. The steps taken by IFC and Panhellenic in response to these reports has shown that our community has not taken this situation lightly, but further steps must be taken by the University to put an end to sexual assault once and for all. 
","There are many pros and cons when it comes to addressing how adequate Title IX is to address sexual assault on campus.  When it was written into law, Title IX opened the door for women to equally participate in the workplace and at educational institutes. But since its implementation, various forms of sexual assault and harrassment still occur within these institutions, and are often brushed off. It is my personal opinion that when it comes to addressing accusations, Title IX leaves University staff too much leeway when it comes to interpreting what is to be defined as sexual assault. A better line of communication must be established between law enforcement and Universities in order for things to improve. ","I myself am not a member of a historically underrepresented group, so I am not the person to determine if our university is effectively serving them. Using my position as an L&S senator, I want to hear first hand from groups within the Multicultural Center and organizations serving our LGBTQ community how our university can better serve them.  ","If elected to serve on the Senate, my first resolution would be to expand CLAS to have one-on-one tutoring sign ups at both the University Center and Davidson Library. This has the potential to aid many students in their studies as a great majority frequently utilize these campus buildings for studying purposes. By expanding CLAS beyond the Student Resource Building, more appointment times will become available to students as a result. ","As a member of A.S., I plan on making myself accessible to the average student by utilizing social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to repost and update the student body on Senate activities. While most of our student body is currently on our platforms, there are many that still aren’t. I believe that the creation of a weekly or monthly Senate newsletter to be sent to student’s UCSB emails would be a creative way to make sure that every student has the tools to keep themselves updated on bills, resolutions, and senate activities. ","I see the top priority for the newly hired UC President being the efforts that need to be taken in order to recover from the damage COVID-19 has done to our community. Many university staff and laborers have been put out of work or laid off due to the UC campus closures. Once the campuses reopen and we transition back to in-person classes, the new UC President should work to ensure that all staff who were displaced by the campus closures have the opportunity to return to their jobs.

Jose Gonzalez Herrera,sanya,L&S Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jose-Gonzalez-Herrera.jpeg,, he/they,3rd ,Sociology major with a minor in Applied Psychology,,,"I considered running for A.S. Senate my first year, back in 2018. I wanted to see positive change happen on campus. Change that would help students achieve their personal ambitions, while advocating for social justice. However, at the time, I did not feel ready to nor did I really understand the different issues students face in college. I took it upon myself to dedicate the next two years of my time here at UCSB to invest myself in organizations and issues that I felt the most passionate about. Along this personal journey, I grew to understand how interconnected everything is. I learned about the community, about real world experiences that have shaped my peers throughout their lives, and about my own experiences and the learning I’ve done. Now, I feel a great restlessness and hurt for the injustices we have all faced in varying degrees at different points in our lives. I’m running to be a College of Letters & Science senator with the 71st senate because I believe I am ready enough to create the change I wish to see at UCSB, and in a greater sense, the world. I’m running because students' voices deserve to be heard, and I want to help them have their voices heard. I want students to have the power and force to change what they see as unfit, and demand what they are owed.","As a first year, I immersed myself in the LGBTQ+ community here on campus by participating in the social life and involving myself in organizations like the Queer Student Union, as their Freshman Liaison and then as their Vice Chair. During my second year, I was involved with A.S. Queer Commission as 1 of the 2 UCSB Pride Co-Chairs, and as a new member of my fraternity, Theta Nu Kappa Multicultural and Academic Fraternity, Inc. Within my fraternity, I have been a part of our recruitment team, one of our Philanthropy Co-Chairs, and now as the President for the 2020-2021 academic year. However, these positions and titles alone don’t prepare me to be a senator. It’s the hard work and perseverance through personal challenges that is what has prepared me. These positions and titles have served as a platform for learning and growth, and have given me many opportunities for personal development, while my education has expanded my worldview. Within the queer community, I have learned to be comfortable with my identity and expression. I’ve grown super comfortable with myself and feel confident enough to never hide who I am. Joining my fraternity has given me a home away from home, and certainty to uncertainty. As a growing adult, I am beginning to understand what I need to do to take care of myself, so that I can better look out for others. In the future, I hope to become a counselor or therapist because what I love the most is helping others. That’s why I feel prepared to be a senator.","I’d like to introduce a resolution/bill supporting and advocating for a reformation of academic advising. Students in the College of Letters & Science are often told that changing their major or taking alternative classes is easier to do than following the path they had originally planned out. They often change majors because of the lack of support. This resolution/bill would include an easier, more transparent method of building a 4-year plan, or a plan for however many years a student plans to attend UCSB. This may include a revamped or new website, where students can build their schedule and be able to check prerequisites and requirements all in one place, as well as chat with an online advisor. Secondly, I’d like to introduce a resolution demanding transparency from OSL in the handling of incidents of interpersonal violence within Greek Life. It’s incredibly important that the UCSB community knows what goes on between the university and Greek Life, so they can have a greater say in the actions that must be taken, jointly with leaders of Greek organizations. Thirdly, I would introduce a bill giving more funding for BCUs. Being able to operate and fund organizations on campus that need them in order to provide the education and resources is essential to student life.","My platform focuses on the issues that I want to see worked on. These include interpersonal violence, student wages, and academic advising. For the first issue, I will be working with Alia Reynolds and Students Against Sexual Assault, in order to implement their “Healthy Masculinities Curriculum” they have created in collaboration with Dr. Victor Rios that is based on his upcoming book on toxic masculinity. Their curriculum focuses on training a selected group of men from IFC fraternities who have expressed interest and have the ability to train their fraternity member peers. I will be helping them by facilitating the expansion of the training to USFC entities (United Sorority and Fraternity Council). For the second issue, I will be hearing the concerns and challenges of students and UC Workers in order to better support them and advocate for them. Workers are not being paid enough to live and survive, and the high costs of living in Isla Vista and Santa Barbara make it incredibly difficult to prioritize their well-being. The third part of my platform that I will work to achieve is college advising. I will be meeting with the College of Letters & Science to discuss ways to better listen to students in order to provide flexibility and better management of student needs, and conducting a survey to find out
which needs need to be fulfilled most for students.","Previously mentioned, I will be working with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) to implement their “Healthy Masculinities Curriculum.” They have been developing this curriculum for the IFC council, and I will be helping them adapt it for multicultural Greek Life. Their current curriculum is based off of Dr. Victor Rios’s upcoming book that deconstructs how toxic/hegemonic masculinity is created and how it can be replaced with healthy masculinity. The training content will be administered to male members of Greek Life and be tested to ensure the training is being absorbed. I will also be working with the College of Letters & Science to advocate for the needs of students. I will be taking advice, comments, criticism, etc. of students in my college and the other colleges to better represent them. Additionally, I hope to work with A.S., the university, and the broader UCSB community in order to help increase working wages and resources available to students that both work, and don’t work, with the UC.","I use a lot of remote forms of communication like social media, email, and phone number. I will try to make myself as accessible as possible to anyone who needs to get in communication with me or who needs my advice. I enjoy helping others, and if I can make things easier for my constituents, then I see no problem in being able to manage and accommodate for a possible shift to online classes through summer and fall quarter. More concrete examples include creating a facebook page where students may get in contact with me, along with plugging other forms of communication on that page and other media platforms.","I have a unique experience and relationship with UCSB. Not only have I been actively involved on campus, but I have shared my leadership, my friendship, and my knowledge with my peers. My identity as a queer, low-income, first-generation, latino student has greatly shaped my college experience and will continue to do so even after college. This institution wasn’t designed for people like me. Yet, I preserved through mental health challenges, homelessness, and being away from my family, which gives me comfort and safety. Being told that I should have dropped out by now by university employees hasn’t stopped me from doing the most I could possibly do for others. I’m the best candidate for this position because I’ve had to fight to be here. I have the experience, the passion, the ambition, the listening skills, and the fire that is required.",Left-leaning,"Very Good; I would give the 70th A.S. Senate a rating of “very good,” because I believe they have acted appropriately and in the best interest of students when addressing the issue of sexual violence earlier this year, supporting AFSCME Local 3299’s union strike, and supporting graduate students COLA wildcat strike.","Yes; To be an ally means you have one foot in and one foot out. To be an advocate means you have both feet in. I’m a humanitarian, and I stand against human rights violations, which includes divesting from companies that profit from them in Israel.","Yes; Education is a right. Cost of tuition should not be a reason for why students decide not to attend.
It should also not be a burden for those going through financial crises. Many students here at
UCSB experience anxiety over being able to afford books, clothes, tools, and the university
should not be demanding tuition or risk a student being dropped from classes.","I consistently use CAPS and DSP services here at the university. My experience with my current therapist has been extremely positive, and I have been able to overcome so much with them. They have helped me apply to DSP and set up an appointment with a psychiatrist at Student Health so that I could receive medication. I’m super happy with where I am. However, my experience using mental health services at UCSB hasn't always been positive. My first year, my family went through homelessness (and are still currently homeless). My mental health wasn’t the best, and it was difficult to reach out to my family without it negatively affecting me. When I went to CAPS, I had to wait about 2 weeks to talk to someone. I came to the conclusion that I had to face this hardship on my own. CAPS and CARE need more funding. They need a larger building, with more resources and staff. The university must be able to support their students through challenges that don’t directly come from academics.","Yes, the university could’ve definitely handled this better. It should not have taken multiple reports of sexual assault for them to take action. The university should’ve worked with the IFC and USFC fraternities earlier and enforced stricter policies and guidelines. Many students were left without information, resources, and education, and survivors were left feeling unheard and unsupported. Even if the police department was conducting an investigation, there was a lot they could’ve done in the meantime, like calling an immediate meeting with all leaders of Greek Life and doing a complete review of their individual risk management policies.","No. Title IX does not immediately respond to the needs of survivors. Sexual assault interferes with every aspect of a person’s life, and immediate action needs to be taken in order to ensure the well-being of survivors. There needs to be financial relief and justice.","No. There were demands to create a free standing resource center for LGBTQ+ students in Fall 2017, but very little progress has been made on that. The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity is currently located in a small room on the third floor of the Student Resource Building. There also is no mandatory training for incoming students that go into further depth on the experiences and complexities of belonging to historically underrepresented groups.","I plan to author a bill requiring complete transparency and immediate resolution from the university, Office of Student Life, Greek Life, and the UCSB community to better support survivors of sexual assault and interpersonal violence. I want to tackle this issue head on, because this affects not just this community, but everyone around the world. This will promote community safety in Isla Vista by ensuring that students are able to report with confidence that the proper steps will be taken and they will be heard. This will also promote community safety by requiring leaders of Greek Life to hold a greater discussion on how we can better protect all communities. We must set a precedent for people to follow and create tangible change that can be looked upon on a national scale. The work that A.S. Senate does not just stay here at UCSB.","I believe canvassing and discussing with different communities on campus needs to be done, which includes the residents halls and in Isla Vista. It is our job to make sure that changes happening within the UC are relayed to our constituents so that they can stay informed and be able to participate in A.S. It is important that we bridge the gap between A.S. and students to make ourselves more accessible. It’s impossible to represent your constituents when you don’t put in the work to get to know them, hear them, and understand them. Most of the student population gets their information from student run news accounts. Administration needs to do the same as well. The people who control UC don’t communicate with students effectively, nor do they listen to those they claim to support and represent. That must be changed.","Someone who supports a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for graduate students & someone who is willing to provide medical supplies to hospitals during crises. Janet Napolitano has failed to be a humanitarian and has proved that she does not care about students. The UC continues to profit off of the work of its students and not reward them for their work. The classes TAs teach is labor they do in order to educate those who give the UC universities their rankings. We as students and UC workers need someone who is supported by us and will listen to us. During this COVID-19 pandemic, she has disallowed UC workers from supplying hospitals with the proper medical supplies that we need in order to survive. This is a global pandemic, and billions of people are at risk.",,,,,,,
Ava Kargosha,sanya,L&S Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ava-Kargosha-rotated.jpeg,,She/her/hers,3rd,Psychological & Brain Sciences and Political Science,,,"I am running to be the Letters and Science senator because I want to create change that better addresses the needs of students. I aspire to instill the values of diversity and equal opportunity in order to make sure that every student feels welcomed and heard on campus. As a part of the middle eastern community on campus, I understand the importance of representation and visibility for minority communities. During my three years here at UCSB, I have noticed many difficulties my peers and myself have faced in the Department of Letters and Sciences. As a Psychological and Brain Sciences major as well as a Political Science major, there have been many times where I’ve logged on during my pass time only to find all of the classes full, been terrified of being cut from an impacted major, and been told by advisors to just switch to a less popular major. I know these struggles are unfortunately not unique to me, and so I am running to improve these conditions so that this added stress is eliminated. If UCSB insists on over enrolling students, then we must insist on putting that money towards creating more classes and hiring more professors to meet the needs of each major.","Being a Resident Assistant in Manzanita last year has definitely prepared me to be a senator as it has taught me how to handle immense responsibility. I was trained for and responded to emergency situations, handled drug and alcohol situations, and counseled residents with mental health concerns and roommate conflicts. The job also taught me how to properly manage my time and be able to work more productively. In addition, the position allowed me to strengthen both my leadership and teamwork skills. I worked independently as well as with fellow RA’s and campus organizations, to plan and host programs for residents. My interpersonal and speech skills also improved greatly as I often held house meetings and had one on one meetings with my residents. Chatting regularly to my 70+ residents allowed me to hear the concerns of students and how each of them struggled to navigate the campus and find resources. These are important skills and experiences as a senator, because knowing what your constituents struggle with and how to connect with students are necessary to create impactful legislation. As a senator, demonstrating responsibility and efficiency in the position is crucial in order to be a competent representative. In addition, I am a member of UCSB Lobby Corp and my experiences in this organization have shown me the power that a single person can have. This has prepared me to be a senator as I have fought for better student conditions as well as learned how to read and analyze legislation. Furthermore, in my first year I was in the Hall Council in Santa Catalina South as the Multicultural Awareness Chair. In this position I participated in biweekly social justice trainings where I learned about the importance of diversity, identity, and equal opportunity, and how to advocate for it effectively. Off of those trainings, I created and hosted events centered on the social justice topics and was able to teach and connect with my peers with honest discussions. This position showed me the importance of representation and visibility of communities, which I believe is important for an AS senator to understand and believe as they are representing so many of those communities. The most important thing I learned from that position, however, is how necessary honest and open discussion is. Everyone deserves the chance to be listened to, and no progress or learning can come from shutting down someone’s voice.","As a Letters and Science Senator, I plan to author a bill to modify and improve GOLD so that students can more easily sign up for classes using a shopping cart system. In this method, students can load up all of the classes they would like to sign up for in a “shopping cart” page before their pass time. This would make it so that once the pass time starts, all the student must do is click “add classes”. There will be an option to have backup classes ready to go if one of the classes is full when you try to add. This decreases the high stress that students face trying to quickly click through all the classes and add them one by one. The next bill I will author if elected is the enhancement of the Swipe Out Hunger program that exists in collaboration with the Food Bank. Enhancing this program and better incentivizing students to donate unused meal swipes would provide meals to students in need. I am very passionate about this project as Food Insecurity is a large issue on our campus. Meal Swipes often go unused especially when students go home for a weekend, and so this bill would allocate more resources to the Swipe Out Hunger Program to make it a larger movement on campus. For example, a point system can be implemented so that students who donate meal swipes get points that can translate to rewards such as free UCSB merchandise or tickets to campus events. Another bill I plan to introduce is the creation of a mentorship program between students and alumni in order to help students navigate career paths and network in their field. Every student is at UCSB in order to get started on their career path, however I don’t believe the school provides enough resources to help us be successful in our fields and interact with professionals. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to create a bill that sponsors a program that pairs up students with faculty and alumni in order to mentor students and help them achieve their goals. This program would allow students to gain advice from professionals in their desired field and learn what day to day tasks would look like for them in that career, specifically from people who were UCSB students just like them. My vision is to collaborate with the Career Center as well as with department heads and the alumni network in order to start this project.","My platform is based around making UCSB and its resources more accessible, and easier to navigate. My platform involves; modifying GOLD so that students can more easily sign up for classes, increasing availability and affordability of textbooks, expanding CLAS to accommodate all majors and learning methods, enhancing the Swipe Out Hunger Program to further decrease student food insecurity, create an AS School Supply Bank, and the implementation of a career mentorship and networking program for students and alumni. I will achieve these goals while in office through working with all members of the senate regardless of party associations. We are all students who want the best for students like ourselves, and so I don’t anticipate many pushback against wanting students to be able to afford food and textbooks. I intend to collaborate with both On Campus and Off Campus senators to execute the expansion of the Swipe Out Hunger program, so that students with meal swipes are incentivized to donate extra swipes to off campus students in need. For the plans to make course registration on GOLD much easier and to make a mentorship alumni program, I plan to collaborate with all of the other collegiate senators so that our collective force can have a large impact on the administration. Overall, I intend to make sure I do everything in my power to pass these bills, such as by reaching out to campus organizations with similar goals, and by consistently pushing the UCSB administration to put student needs first.","Firstly, I hope to work with faculty and administration to change the course selecting system on GOLD to make it easier and more user friendly, as well as expanding course reserves and digital rental options. I then plan to work with department heads in Letters and Sciences to work on creating new majors and minors to better fit the needs of students. I also hope to work with the department heads on creating pages for each major so that students can form study groups. In addition, I plan to work with CLAS and CAPS in order to bolster both of the programs in order to be equipped to serve a larger population of students. I also plan on working with the Swipe Out Hunger organization and the Food Bank in order to better incentivize and advertise meal swipe donations. Furthermore, I plan on working with the Career Center to create the alumni mentorship program in order to help students successfully transition into their careers after they graduate.",I will make myself available to my constituents through zoom office hours as well as through my facebook page where they can message me questions and concerns. I will make sure to remain available to constituents no matter the status of the campus itself.,"I am the best candidate for this position because I am experienced in working with students and staff as described in my previous positions as a Resident Assistant and a Multicultural Awareness Chair. I also served as Vice President of Persian Student Group, which allowed me to work with the Student Resource Building, EOP, and other cultural organizations. In those collaborations, I got a glimpse at how diverse and rich our many communities are at UCSB, but also how hidden many of the resources can be and how we can make our organizations even better. In addition, I am a double major within the Letters and Science Department, one being a BS degree and the other a BA degree, and so I understand the needs and concerns of students in either side of the department. I will ensure that my Senate legislation will benefit everyone because I am hard working, determined, and incredibly passionate to represent and hear from the students I aim to serve. I am the best candidate because I consistently strive to improve the condition of UCSB students, whether it be by lobbying for student mental healthcare in Sacramento or working with housing staff to improve university housing.",Left-leaning,"Very Good; There have been several pieces of legislation this year that I have been very pleased with such as Daniel Segura’s and Racquel Almario’s resolution calling out the UC system for its unfair labor practices, and Adalis Rojas and Ektaa Tendolkar’s resolution to reissue UCSB as a sanctuary campus. However, I hope to see more legislation focused on fixing the never ending wait times at CAPS, and on helping students academically in terms of expanding CLAS and with smoother course registration.","I do not believe I am educated enough on this topic to make a decisive decision. I am always in support of human rights, however this issue is not black and white. Both sides have very valid arguments for and against divestment and I look forward to hearing the concerns of my constituents on this topic.","Yes; Yes, because I believe education is a right and must be a nation’s priority. Public universities should be accessible to the general public, and the proposed solution of raising taxes by $48 per household would achieve this goal of free higher education for all. However, as this goal is not likely to be achieved for a while, my goal as a senator would be to seek out ways to expand scholarships and grants for students.","No, I don’t believe the mental health services at UCSB are adequate. CAPS is a great resource however it lacks a lot of infrastructure to keep it running smoothly. There are not enough hired professionals on staff that are trained for the diverse array of students and mental health issues we face. The process of getting an appointment can be very disheartening and nearly impossible. Getting a hold of a psychiatrist at Student Health is even less of a possibility as they are booked for the entire quarter by the second day of the quarter. Telling students to wait until next quarter to receive mental health treatment is not an option. The mental health services need to be bolstered, because UCSB students are paying a lot of money for these services that they are never actually able to utilize. There needs to be a redistribution of funds, making CAPS and Student Health a priority. I propose that CAPS staff be accessible in all of the resident halls and in Pardall Center, in addition to their place in the CAPS building. CAPS should also allow appointments to be made online, as many students may not be physically or mentally capable of making the appointment in person.","Although I was studying abroad during fall quarter and not on campus during that time, I remained updated on the situation through school emails and Daily Nexus articles. I do believe the university could have handled the situation better by responding more quickly to the reports and being much more clear about the steps that were being taken to investigate the situation. Even though I understand that under TItle IX the anonymity of the alleged assailant is needed to protect the anonymity of the victim by proxy, the university had a responsibility to inform the school of the fraternity involved, as it was their third sexual assault allegation that month alone. It remains eerily unclear what happened to the investigation and whether the alleged assailant had endured any consequences by the university. This is unsettling as the student body deserves to know the outcome of this investigation. I commend the fraternity for expelling the member from the fraternity, and I believe the organization did the best they could in the aftermath of that situation. However, I believe that Greek Life and the university need to focus more intently on education and sexual assault prevention to ensure that situations like these do not occur. If elected senator, I intend on implementing such a program.","Title IX has helped many students who have been involved in sexual assault, and is a great resource however the main problem with Title IX is that it does not take sexual violence as seriously as the justice system does. The Title IX punishment is usually year-long suspension, as the investigation process and punishment is entirely up to the schools’ discretion. Therefore, it is only an adequate system if the university chooses to make it so. There are countless stories of victims who have to continue to attend school with their attacker even after being found guilty. Therefore, there are several changes that can be made to make Title IX work for its students. If expulsion is the consequence of academic dishonesty at most schools, sexual assault should be too. In addition, survivors of sexual assault need to be sufficiently supported by their school in terms of
mental health and comfortability to report. The law should be revised to require universities to create a safe environment for plaintiffs, even if the accused is not found guilty. For example, the school to make sure the two parties are not in the same classes, do not have to live in the same building, and so on. This would provide the plaintiff an extra sense of security and comfort, in the cases where a guilty attacker was wrongfully found innocent. It has been almost half a century since Title IX was signed into federal law, and it is time the law becomes updated.","Although UCSB admits an even more diverse group of students each year than the last, I do not believe that UCSB is serving historically underrepresented groups as effectively as they can be. For example, the university has not put in enough effort to communicate with members of BSU and the black community. BSU members have been consistently advocating for themselves and their community, and UCSB has not been actively working on providing for their well deserved needs. In addition, while it is wonderful that UCSB is a hispanic serving institution, the school does not provide effective resources for those students after they are admitted. More can be done to retain retention rates for latinx students, such as with a diversification of EOP to allow for more specialized counselors and mentors to meet individual needs. Also, the RCSGD is a great resource center, however I believe there are many other departments that can be doing more to destigmatize and discuss the mental health issues the LGBTQ+ community faces. Fortunately, I believe that AS does a great job of representing the different communities at UCSB. Minority communities contribute a lot to the success of UCSB, and investing in students will always pay off.","When elected to the Senate, the first bill I plan to author is the expansion of CAPS in order to shorten wait times and provide weekend services. CAPS does not currently have a staff that is able to handle our student population. Therefore, I would like to reallocate more funds into CAPS, without raising tuition, in order to make sure that students are not left waiting months in order to receive the mental health treatments that they are paying the school for. This would involve more hired professionals, an online appointment center, bolstered weekend services, and a more diverse team to be able to provide for the varied needs of students. The mental health crisis is very real, and it is horrifying that the second leading cause of death for young people is suicide. Our campus is no stranger to these tragedies, and it is far overdue for some real change to happen. It is shameful that the services we are paying for are often out of reach and unavailable. The university needs to put students first, and CAPS needs to become a realistic resource. As an RA last year for Manzanita Village, I would often recommend CAPS as a resource, and I would dread having to hear back from my resident about how they were turned away and told to try again to get an appointment in a few weeks. Over enrollment worsens the already minimal amount of service that CAPS is able to give, therefore the university must expand CAPS and other services if it continues to expand the student population.","This is my first year joining the A.S. network, and being a third year, I definitely felt that AS was inaccessible to me. I didn’t even know we had a senate or a legislative
body until my second year, and even then was unaware of the work they did. The AS system comes off as very ambiguous and out of reach. I personally felt intimidated by it and did not know how to get involved for the longest time. I did not feel like I was the AS “type”, however since joining the Isla Vista Party and getting to know more people who are involved in AS, I have realized the great thing about AS is that there is no “type”. The best part about this organization is that its purpose is to gather students from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and have them work as a team to better the UCSB experience. And so if we want to truly represent the student body, they must be aware we are representing them at all. Therefore, I propose that senate meetings be broadcasted online, and be available for the student body to view. In addition, legislation that is in the process of being voted on, or has been either passed or failed to pass must be made public and accessible as well. I propose that biweekly emails be sent out to the student body with links to all of this material, so that they can view and comment on what their representatives are working on. In addition, AS and the inner workings of student legislation must be discussed during Transfer Student and First Year Student orientations. This would allow students from all experiences to have a chance to get involved.","The top priority for the next UC president will be to finally have a dialogue with the striking grad students, and discuss the COLA movement which President Napolitano and her staff repeatedly refused to do. In line with this, the issues of food insecurity and homelessness for both undergraduate and graduate students need to be a priority for the UC system if they want to keep its high retention rates. Basic needs must be met for students to be able to be successful. No one can perform well on a test if they are stressing about where their next meal will come from. Better access to resources and more grants must be given to make sure that no student falls through the cracks. Next, reviewing and fixing the flaws in the CAPS system must be a priority. This is an especially pressing issue with the increased need for mental health support after the closure of UC campuses during the spring quarter. The effects of social distancing and being away from UC support systems will be long lasting. The UC system is a wealthy one, and it's time for the students to be treated as an investment instead of as a piggy bank.",,,,,,,

In addition so many umbrella organizations and amendments for made to create needed spaces for students
","Yes; Absolutely. Education institutions should be for education and JUST that, educational institutions. Having monetary investments in controversial matters or anything unrelated to the campus should not occur. Invest in the students, we could really use the money.","Yes; I believe higher education should be free. There is no reason it isn't. Education is most often inaccessible due to its monetary costs and hardship. I believe all basic necessities should be free. Access to education is one of them. 
","I personally had to wait an entire quarter before being seen because there were absolutely no appointments available. I know so many people who do not  get the mental resources they need because they are told they must wait 3+ weeks to be seen. It's unacceptable, especially when the school promises access to mental health but cannot actually provide it. Mental health is paramount to academic success, there should be enough licensed mental health personnel to match the needs of students.","Yes the university could have definitely handled the situation better. The university should have responded more expediently , in addition Fraternities should be called out by name in the reports sent to students.This prevents rumors and can keep others safe. Organizations should be penalized more severely. They should be suspended or disbanded if they begin to rack up sexual assault cases. That's it. There should be a zero tolerance policy for that type of offence. ","Title IX is not enough and leaves many survivors dissatisfied. In many cases many survivors feel that there is no resolve at all. It is a step forward in the right direction, but it could definitely be improved upon.","Somewhat as  marginalized communities are usually assisted superficially.. Although there are many organizations and  clubs made and ran by those in the communities , the communities still lack the appropriate funding ,assistance and representation they need.","From the Thomas Fire to the current COVID-19 pandemic, emergencies have shown how student voices are left unheard during major academic and departamental decisions. I want to COLLABORATE with academic departments, student organizations, OSL, and other on-campus entities to PREPARE and establish an emergency PLAN that can be implemented university wide, particularly within the College of Letters and Sciences, to ensure students are supported academically, mentally, and physically especially  during these  emergencies and unprecedented times of environmental uncertainty.","I would invite students to meetings, request my fellow peers' opinions on potential bills, share my drafts with fellow students and ask how it can be approved upon. As a student I will make sure bills and amendments being made are representative of the students I'm representing. ","We need to see a UC President who makes the students its first priority. Cost of Living Adjustment for Grad students, tuition reduction, student retention and financial assistance for students experiencing exasperated financial hardship. During these unprecedented times students need support.",,,,,,,
Gabriel Bravo,sanya,Engineering Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gabriel-Bravo.jpg,,He/Him/His,2nd,Mechanical Engineering Major,,,"I am running because I want to bring change to this campus and target issues affecting the productivity and well-being of the College of Engineering. I look forward to making sure engineering students have their voices heard on adjustments to CLAS services, curriculum, availability of resources, and any other issues. This reform will ultimately develop a more successful College of Engineering as a whole.","On campus, I have been involved in an Engineering Organization - Los Ingenieros. Within this organization, I always choose to surround myself with the org’s officers to get to know leadership skills and characteristics. Additionally, I work as a student intern for the Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) of UCSB. Under this position, I perform a multitude of tasks, from student data entry to tour and major event preparation. My goal is to always get my tasks done quickly and efficiently, while simultaneously looking for new methods to improve productivity - methods that will save an organization time and money. The responsibility and discipline I have received from this position will surely benefit me as the Senator for The College of Engineering. One needs both discipline and the ability to work under great responsibilities to make sure issues are addressed with necessary action.","While in office, I would like to introduce an improvement for mental health services, CLAS for engineering courses, and food insecurity. Improved mental health services will help
with the well being of students and other internal issues. CLAS is a tutorial service that is almost always non-existent for the major engineering courses. Fighting for these CLAS services would ensure an increase in academic success and a decrease in stress endured from concepts that are difficult to comprehend in engineering courses. From my personal experience, CLAS and CLAS drop-ins are effective in getting engineering students additional practice; they serve as additional sessions to explain and break down engineering course related work. These sessions work great with our schedules, for the most part. However, for those that do not have flexible schedules, there is a much more convenient service called CLAS Drop-In (3rd floor of the SRB). CLAS drop-ins provide service to any student that signs in. If tutors were to be available for engineering coursework support (from opening to closing), grades in engineering courses would improve substantially. Moreover, the goal for food insecurity is to minimize student hunger at our university. Food issues can range from insufficient meal swipes to insufficient groceries. I want to work to make sure these issues end up declining.","I will contact the engineering student body to compile a list of all concerns and issues regarding mental health services, CLAS, and food insecurity. Additionally, if the engineering students happen to find another prevalent issue, I will make sure to address additional problems in an effective manner. This gives me the ability to directly address ongoing issues concerning engineering students. For the mental health and CLAS services, I will contact both services and explain my ideas of improvement. I will contact upperclassmen, tutors, and TA’s to ask if they would be interested in tutoring for engineering courses. Moreover, I will work to get these CLAS services in a more convenient location (closer to the Engineering side of campus) to better accommodate engineering students. Lastly, for food security, I would like to open up more food pantries on and off campus. We can set up vending machines (on and off campus) that will allow students to select a few free items via access card. In addition, I will work to have unused meal swipes roll over and allow students the ability to swipe in guests. These methods will essentially help the student body make the most of its resources.","I look to cooperate with the students of the College of Engineering. Specifically the organization I am a part of, Los Ingenieros, which embodies those who are underrepresented and are in need of resources on campus. This organization is full of students just like me, as we all work to pursue a great education given difficult circumstances. Although we lack some prior guidance for what to expect in college, we still manage to persevere and overcome such hardships to continue to succeed. Therefore, these students will help support me and my campaign, allowing my name to spread throughout the UCSB community","I will make myself available through my phone number, student email, and Zoom office hours. I will not only be able to be contacted through permanently set office hours, but I will also make myself available through Zoom appointments.","I obtain skills and characteristics of a leader from my leadership in organizations prior to attending college, as well as the leadership I withhold under my student intern position at EAOP. I am a responsible candidate that is willing to address issues brought to me directly by my student body. I understand the hardships low-income first-gen students endure and I am able to relate to that population. However, I am willing to stand for every single student under the College of Engineering, ensuring we all cooperate and develop a successful Engineering class.",Left-leaning,"Good; A.S. Senate provides numerous resources for our students, such as the A.S. Bike Shop, Financial Literacy Workshops, A.S. Food Bank, etc. A.S. Senate tries its best to reduce financial instability amongst the student body, through the accessibility of more grants or through the provisions of accessible food for our students. Although further action has been cut short due to the outbreak, I feel A.S. had more gas in the tank that we can potentially build upon for the upcoming year. I want to see further action with the COLA
movement and improvements on mental health services","Yes; The Palestinians deserve equal rights, as we all do. WE are all equally human beings. Therefore, we all deserve the same human rights. We should not be cooperating with such injust companies that discriminate against others. It is our duty to support our Palestinians people against Israel’s apartheid.","Yes; Numerous individuals are unable to attend UC’s due to its expensive tuition costs. Many endure stress, due to the outrageous tuition costs, which affects our well-being and academic performance. Many students look for ways to minimize their debt. For example, cutting back on meals leads to another prevalent issue on this campus: food insecurity. Tuition free universities will encourage more low-income, first generation students to attend while alleviating current students of such financial burdens.Additionally, low-income students always hear of the myths about how expensive college is, which is discouraging when you come from a financially disadvantaged background. All in all, this would strongly encourage many more students to attend universities and pursue a greater education.","I believe the mental health services can be improved. One way to get more service to students is to have counselors give students a small gift, snack, meal swipe, etc., while receiving counseling. Incentives get students interested to go and it would get our counselors to support more of our students. For example, some researchers on campus attract their subjects by offering a gift for their participation. I am not saying showing up to counseling is an experiment, but why not put some money towards counseling students that need it? Typically, students are more willing to participate when they know they will be benefiting much more in return. Moreover, UCSB could increase their number of peer support services. To elaborate, having counselors that have not only studied but been through similar experiences as the students seeking help could be a lot more effective. The two can share their experiences and strategies to resolve the issues they have dealt with. These steps will ultimately make students more comfortable with UCSB mental health services.","Absolutely. Problems regarding the safety of our students must always be addressed in an expedited manner. We are given modules to complete at the beginning of the school year, regarding sexual assaults that can possibly happen on and off campus. We are given set guidelines on what to do if such a horrific event were to occur. However, the University does need to develop more effective tactics for sexual assault. We need to work on ways to make those survivors feel comfortable with reporting their assaulters. Sadly, universities are only required to do the bare minimum when supporting those who have been assaulted. As a result, these cases that are reported tend to get brushed away under the rug and no one hears from them ever again. Moreover, it may even be more comfortable for those assaulted to report to CSO’s, which are relatively closer in age to these students. I’m sure it feels intimidating or embarrassing to report to a much older authoritative individual.","I do not believe Title IX is the best system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Students are fearful of their assaulters finding out they have been reported by their victims. The students are allowed to make anonymous electronic reports, but that does
not do much justice either. To specify, the report is sent to the Title IX office, but a follow up is quite difficult when you do not have any info about the potential survivor. This is the most common form of a report being sent and that is why it is extremely difficult to have the Title IX Office perform on their end. For those cases that are reported in-person, numerous interviews are held to gather necessary information. If there is enough information, then the Title IX Office will proceed with an investigation. Afterwards, the only actions the Office can make are removing the perpetrator from campus (through suspension or expelling), adjusting the schedules of the perpetrator and the victim to make sure they do not interfere, and issuing no contact orders. Although Title IX does try its best to address sexual assault, these reports solely go under academic processes rather than undergoing criminal processes. These are reasons why students on our campus and everywhere deserve to have institutional resources that go above and
beyond what Title IX does.","UCSB has not effectively served these marginalized communities yet, but has made some noticeable improvements to serve our underrepresented population. For example, there are locations and organizations all throughout campus that cater to the underrepresented, such as the Student Resource Building, The Multicultural Center, El Centro, The Educational Opportunity Program and much more. Additionally, UCSB allows the underrepresented to hold events and fundraisers all throughout campus. This allows for culture and diversity to flourish through the community, encouraging a more inclusive community. In other words, all people are invited to such events of Black, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ communities, reducing the descrimination and encouraging equality. As a result, the underrepresented has grown stronger, yet these are only preliminary actions that leave room for improvement. For example, first-gen, low-income students should be immediately informed of peer mentors that can help guide them through their first year(s) of college. This is extremely useful for those students who do not have any family members that have had the chance to attend a university. These students may enter college not knowing what to expect. We do not want these students to feel overwhelmed their first year. The same thing goes for students who are a part of the Latinx, Black, LGBTQ+, and many more diverse groups amongst our community. Providing peer mentors for these students can effectively go a long way.","One major issue I wish to tackle is food insecurity within our student body. Food insecurity affects approximately 48% of undergraduate students. Food insecurity is a prevalent problem that affects our students mentally, financially, and academically. For example, students who have meal swipes are not allowed to swipe in additional guests. Those guests are then forced to pay for an additional meal even when the student with meal swipes may have some additional meal swipes that he/she/they may not need. Moreover, meal swipes do not roll over to each upcoming week. So, if you have any leftover meals from the previous week, they are automatically erased from your access for the next week. Although UCSB allows us to donate our meal swipes, it does not guarantee a meal swipe to our guests or friends who are hungry at the moment. From my experience, I decided to lower my amount of meal swipes to work on saving more money. Hunger affects our well being, leading to additional stress and even depression. Therefore, a new policy must be enforced to ensure less students are going hungry on this campus.","First and foremost, I’d like to treat my position as part of a direct democracy. Therefore, I am here to reach out and listen to our students to ensure their needs are met to the best that we, the A.S. Senate, can accommodate them. For example, I would work to get the student body more involved through the utilization of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. A strong percentage of students are already on social media. If each of us in the Senate were to share information regarding A.S. on the aforementioned platforms, the viewers could possibly get the word out to their friends, and we can eventually get a chain reaction to occur. Yes, we should continue to email the student body to make sure we inform the entire population. But, spamming the students’ email accounts will not do us the best justice. That is why we should work on providing information, both visual and scriptive, on all media platforms","The next UC President should work on reducing student tuition costs and protecting our underrepresented students. The next UC President should also take the COLA strikes into consideration, in order to further accommodate our graduate students in their efforts for a more livable wage. Additionally, ongoing issues with food insecurity (meal swipes for guests and rolling over meals) must be addressed. Those without meal plans are equally affected by food insecurity. With university tuition continuing to rise, financial aid suffices less and less every year. For this reason, more students are left facing more student loans and work to live from paycheck to paycheck. This causes students to take longer to earn their bachelor’s degree, with a hefty lump of debt awaiting them for the aftermath of it all. Therefore, action is much needed to reduce food insecurity cases on campus. All in all, resolution for these problems should alleviate an immense amount of stress amongst UC students and the UC community.",,,,,,,
Brandon Villarreal,sanya,Transfer Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brandon-Villarreal.jpg,,He/They,3rd,Political Science Major w/ Minor in Black Studies,,,"I am running for senate because I believe the university needs more diversity and new representation at this school. In my short time here at this institution, I have seen several events take place that are unacceptable and put our student population at risk. We need accurate representation for the marginalized communities who are most impacted by lack of resources, support, and outreach. I come from a family of immigrants, a first-generation college student myself, and a member of the LGBTQ+ community. My journey to get to this institution and succeed while here has been unique and difficult. I would like to help others by drawing from my personal experiences along with learning the needs of others. I have always gotten involved politically at every institution I have found myself at. I have served in positions ranging from class president in high school to health and safety commissioner at my former community college. I wanted to run to try to use my past experience to help make this institution a better place for all of us, not just a select few. I want to run so I can give others the opportunity to speak at the table in situations where they have previously been absent. I want to run to make a difference!","I have been at this institution for less than a full academic year, but I have still found myself staying busy from the start! My first quarter here, I was appointed as Administrative chair for Queer Commission, one of the BCUs in UCSB’s Associated Students that focuses on Queer and Trans issues. Most recently, I have been elected as the Internal Vice-President and Philanthropy Chair for UCSB’s first QTPOC sorority, Zeta Sigma Nu (ZEN). Through these organizations, I have made many meaningful connections via town halls, private meetings, and events, and have truly been able to get a sense of what our communities need. Our POC and QT communities have been underserved for far too long. I have seen how the transfer community has been forgotten about. These communities have been lumped in with everyone else. As someone who is a part of these communities, I want to bring more attention to the unique problems we face. By communicating with both current senators and candidates, I have already begun to formulate concrete plans and projects to work on. I hope that my experience, both past and present, and my knowledge about the issues we have here at UCSB can be of service to the student population.","If I were blessed enough to be elected to the senate, I plan on introducing bills as my fist act of duty. The bills I plan to introduce first will be regarding pertinent issues that I have seen during my short time here at UCSB. Transfer students face unprecedented mental health and housing issues. In addition to a sort of shock, being introduced to a new and more rigid learning environment, students must also learn to adapt to the social and financial struggles that come with transferring to a new university. I want to sponsor a bill that allocates more resources to services to provide for these students in ways that we legally can. Black and brown queer people of color are disproportionately subject to more violence and racism than their counterparts. I believe the school can do more to protect this community. I want to sponsor a bill that allocates special safehouses and areas for our community to gather. One way this can be done and one area I plan to look into is safe living spaces or living/learning communities. I believe we need more of these not only in Isla Vista but in the dorms and university apartments as well. The third bill I plan to introduce pertains to accountability. I want to see any student or organization that engages in assault be held accountable. Past organizations, who shall not be named, have gotten nothing but a slap on the wrist when their members engage in predatory behavior and/or commit crimes against their peers. There are individuals who are more concerned with these institutions/their organizations imagine than people’s lives. ","My platform is all about giving voices to those who have historically been left out and forgotten about. That could pertain to bigger politics on an international and national level or local politics regarding the institution and our community. I want to bring the issues that affect these marginalized communities into the conversation. I want to give those in these communities a seat at the table so they can use their experiences and their knowledge to help better our institution. Our issues are different and require special attention. Transfer students require different resources than newly admitted freshman. Each community within the LGBTQ+ sphere has its own issues and the whole community cannot be lumped into one big group when it comes to problem solutions. If I were blessed to be elected, I would hope that my ascension to senator as a first-generation Mexican student who is LGBTQ+ would make others feel that they belong here at this institution and that they are seen. They too can rise to high levels of power and hopefully someone after me will create far more change than I could have ever hoped to do. ","As mentioned, I am a member of the LGBTQ+ community. I am also a first- generation student from a family of Mexican immigrants. I am also a transfer student and this is my third institution that I have attended. Thankfully, there are already several organizations for these communities. La Familia de Colores, Queer Commission, the RCSGD, QTC, UndocuQueer UndocuTrans, the Transfer Student Center, etc. The list goes on and on. As mentioned, I have already developed personal relationships with many of the leaders in these organizations and we have been discussing ways in which we can better serve our peers. I have also been in contact with and have had the pleasure of assisting in creating and organizing new organizations such as Zeta Sigma Nu (ZEN) which is a new Queer and Trans People of Color Sorority and the Transfer Union which is a new organization which is meant to focus on transfer students issues that the university overlooks. I plan to hold frequent meetings with these organizations to discuss what we need to be addressing in our communities. I want to make our time here at UCSB easier and more accessible to those who come from alternative backgrounds. We all don’t share the same privileges and therefore we all cannot use the same resources in the same way. I want to address that and I know these organizations would be more than willing and more than helpful to assist.  ","If we continue with our shift to online and remote learning, I would be more than happy and ready to make myself available to my constituents. I am prepared to hold office hours, multiple times a week to make sure I am available should someone need to reach me. These office hours will be held at constituent times and random times to ensure that I am accessible to everyone and their personal schedules. I am also still somewhat close to UCSB so should the stay at home orders be dismissed, I will be on campus in person frequently for any meetings I may need to have. I also am active on all platforms of social media (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, Tumblr, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.); you won’t have to look for it in order to be able to privately message me. I have also wanted to create some kind of messaging system with transfer students so I can better communicate with my peers directly. I was thinking of someone along the lines of the Remind app or a GroupMe page. I believe one issue that the university needs to work on is communication with its students and I hope to work on that, beginning with my own personal communication to my peers.","I must be honest, I struggled with how to answer this question. I struggled because I do not know if I am the best candidate for this position. I am not all knowing and I am not all powerful. With that being said, there will always be someone who is smarter than me and someone who is more experienced than me. They might have all the answers to these problems that I am looking for. I know I have a lot to learn and a lot to work on. With that being said, I must admit that I believe my experience will help in this position. I believe that I have made personal connections to people and with organizations on this campus that deserve to have their voices heard. I know that I will work tirelessly every single day to make sure my peers feel safe, feel encouraged, and feel supported to do the things they came to this institution to do. I am growing as a person every single day and I hope to bring what I have learned from my unique experiences to UCSB to make change, for the better. I do not know if I am the best candidate for this position. As a candidate, I do not think I am in the position to make that decision. That decision is left up to the voters, y’all get to decide who is the best candidate for this position. With that being said, I can assure you I will work my hardest every single day, so vote for me and Isla Vista Party!",Left-leaning,"Fair; I rated the current work of the senate fair. I did so because I do not see how you can properly represent the diverse student population when the current representatives aren’t that diverse. I believe the representatives should reflect the student population’s beliefs and to do that you need to listen to all communities of students, not just the ones who have always been there. 
","Yes; Yes, divestment has been long overdue at UCSB. The failure to divest in a representation of who truly owns the school and who truly has a say in how this institution operates. The human rights violations that are taking place at the hand of Israel is unacceptable. Divestment has long been overdue. ","Yes; I believe the wording on this question is meant for interpretation but yes, I do believe tuition at UCSB should be free. I believe as a public institution, the university should be funded by the richest people in this country.  There are several ways we could pay for this and there are currently even presidential candidates proposing their own ways to do this. In short, yes, tuition should be free for students. ","I want to start off this answer by thanking the staff, volunteers, and workers who maintain our health services at UCSB. The services we have at this institution are a great start but they are not enough. The system we have in place is not adequate enough to meet our population's needs. My brother passed away at the end of fall quarter last year. At the beginning of winter quarter, I went out to CAPS to try and take care of my mental health so I could grieve properly. I learned firsthand the issues with our system. The long wait times, the lack of staff, the lack of funding. When I finally was able to get my referral to a therapist, I was given a list and told I had to personally find a therapist. I spent the next 2 months calling therapists from that list and communicating with CAPS to send more and more phone numbers because no therapist had called me back. Finally, I found a therapist who is able to see me and the day before I am scheduled to meet him for our first session, COVID-19 breaks out and we are issued to stay at home. My brother passed away in November and I had been trying to see someone since January. There is no reason why I was barely able to make an appointment with  an actual therapist at the end of March. That is too much time. There are students on this campus who need care urgently. There are situations that require immediate attention. We need more funding and more resources. More attention needs to be given to these issues. ","Yes, I do believe the university could and should have handled these situations better. These are predators. We have predators living in our community. We as a society deserve to know exactly who they are, where they live, what their offense was, and what the action being done will be. The university failed to tell us all of that. Not to mention they failed to tell us about the incident for a few days in the first place. This is unacceptable. It later was revealed that there weren’t credible lines of communication between departments (such as the police department and the university) and therefore, the majority of parties were unaware of the incident. This is unacceptable. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the survivors and other passionate leaders, the school has been making structural changes. More needs to be done and there needs to be accountability taken. The lack of commitment from administration is disturbing as well. Their statements of support were sent out but their actions spoke a different story. They were noticeably absent at a majority of town halls and meetings. Are our concerns not worthy of hearing in person or will its administration just scroll over them as they try to skim through their emails in the morning? Enough is enough! ","I do not believe Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault that happens at university of California campuses. The process in which a survivor must go through is ridiculous and can drag out for months at a time. The survivor isn’t given enough resources to meet their needs and in the process while the report is making its way through the bureaucracy, the survivor is forced to occupy the same spaces as their abuser. This is all just unacceptable. In a society and at an institution that prides itself on protecting the kids and students, I believe students are being failed miserably when it comes to this. More responsive action needs to be done and right away at that. No more lag time between departments, institutions, and consequences being taken. It is hard to say exactly what could be fixed without wanting to dismantle the whole thing and start over with a completely new system in place. Something must be done either way and it must be done soon. As we saw, there are predators out there and around us and new measurements need to be taken to make sure our students are safe. ","I believe that there are resources in place for these. With organizations and resources such as the RCSGD, Queer Commission, La Familia de Colores, the Trans Student Center, etc. there are existing places that proved vital resources to our students, however, I believe that more can be done. We need more counselors at the EOP center and more funding so they can hand out more scholarships and grants. Besides more funding, organizations such as the RCSGD, Queer Commission, and Transfer Union all need their own standing buildings and offices to get more work done. There is no reason why one organization should be sharing an office with 3 other organizations. There are resources in place but I believe it is almost just for show and tell. Just the surface needs are being met and even that is a stretch. We need to be providing more and the root of these issues need to be addressed. Affordable housing in IV and throughout the dorms, rollover meal plans, cheaper tuition costs, free/cheaper parking. Providing these would be a start to accurately serving these communities and ensuring their success here at UCSB. ","If I were blessed enough to be elected to the senate, I plan on introducing two bills simultaneously as my fist act of duty. The bills I plan to introduce will be regarding two pertinent issues. Transfer students face unprecedented mental health and housing issues. In addition to a sort of shock, being introduced to a new and more rigid learning environment, students must also learn to adapt to the social and financial struggles that come with transferring to a new university. I want to sponsor a bill that allocates more resources to services to provide for these students in ways that we legally can. Black and brown queer people of color are disproportionately subject to more violence and racism than their counterparts. I believe the school can do more to protect this community. I want to sponsor a bill that allocates special safehouses and areas for our community to gather. One way this can be done and one area I plan to look into is safe living spaces or living/learning communities. I believe we need more of these not only in Isla Vista but in the dorms and university apartments as well. There are several ways to make our community feel safe. ","As mentioned in some of my previous answers, I believe one of the school’s main areas that needs improvement is its communication. That is where I would start when it came to accessibility to the average student. I want to research the best tool for outreach with the student population. I will look at past methods I have used such as twitter accounts for specific audiences to tweet out information and to receive feedback or the Remind app to send out information and have one on one private conversations for feedback. I will also be searching for other methods that we could possibly use. I believe the school could do better and I will be working through the necessary channels to see what could be improved. I was also thinking of setting up outposts of information throughout IV where people can get information about services that the campus offers and that they can get throughout the community. In times of distress, someone might not have access to campus and/or the internet and therefore we need this information readily available all throughout areas that are heavily populated by students. There are many small steps that can be taken right away and while I am doing research about what can and cannot be done legally, I believe those things can be done to help our students immediately. ","In the search for the next UC President there are several factors that need to be taken into account. First and foremost, I believe that the next president should be a former educator. I believe she should have been a public-school teacher at some point in her career. I also believe it should be a woman; we need more women leading our institutions and students. I believe the UC system is full of passionate and politically active students. Every year, there are several issues that students bring to the attention of administration and several movements that began on campus, most recently for example the COLA movement, starting at UCSC. We need a president who supports our concerns and addresses them right away. A progressive thinking president is what our universities deserve. In our ever-changing society, we continue to adapt to structural changes. Our next president needs to be able to adapt and be willing at that to the changes that the students need. She shouldn’t be forced to do it; it should come naturally as soon as the problem is presented. She will be the president; she can make a solution happen. It will be interesting to see who will end up replacing Janet as president. ",,,,,,,

My experience in AS on Committee on Committees helped me understand what works (and what really just doesn’t) in our association, and I’m ready to turn that into positive change for our engineers. 

I’m often faced with comments from non-engineering students such as, “You don’t seem like the typical engineer I’d expect,” or “I don’t have any other engineering friends.” My time in the college has shown me that there’s diversity in our college, and the reason we’re often not seen is systemic. My goals this term are to create more opportunities on campus for engineering students to engage with non-engineering activities and programs, to offer our unique skillset (as so many others on campus have) and to gain from others’ perspective. 

Our campus is strong when working, united, towards the betterment of all students -- it’s time to get AS behind our backs. 
","The best student leaders are the ones who understand the community and can turn experience into movement. Working in campus-org leadership has prepared me in understanding what students groups need to further their work and I’m set on being a resource to these community-engagers. Our student body is vibrant because of our wealth of communities -- let’s come together to provide our students access to campus resources and create experiences together. 

I’ve been part of the Gaucho Tour Association, Model UN, Adventure Programs, Sigma Eta Pi, Sunrise Movement, TableTalk, TAMID, AS, Engineers Without Borders, Design For America + more -- it’s really been a ride 😅! The UCSB campus has provided me with so many opportunities and my goal is to provide back. 
","-INCREASE CAPSTONE FUNDING for independent projects so engineering students can focus on personal interests such as sustainability rather than defense corporations. 
-EXPAND FOOD RESOURCES on campus to target where student populations spend the most time, ensuring food is never a question of cost, time or accessibility. 
-ENGAGE CLAS SERVICES to cover lower-division classes with at least 50 students to ensure students begin their studies on campus with the proper support and resources. 
-ADVOCATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH on campus by resolving AS towards finding innovative methods to fund increased CAPS support on campus and continue programs such as Peer Advising that bring the community together in supporting one another. 
","Ensure basic needs and improve academic support. Focusing on improved food and mental health services will help students’ holistic wellbeing, and improved academic resources will support students to excel in their coursework while having more time to take care of themselves and focus on their interests -- these are two aspects of campus life that I’ve seen in my peers to be pressing matters. 

I’ll be working with the vast resources that AS holds in placing funding behind our goals -- millions of student-sourced dollars that deserve to be spent the way that students need. 

I’ll liaise closely with student groups, focused on engineering groups, to ensure that student needs are heard and properly brought to the table. 

And I’ll work with faculty from across the departments to see where we can find interdisciplinary opportunities for our students. We are learning actionable skills -- we should utilize them to make our community more resilient. 
","Engineers: Engineering Student Council (as a given), ASME, IEEE and AIChE, to get representational up-to-date views on what engineers are looking for on campus. 

Professional Orgs: SWE, Los Ingenieros, NSBE, Engineers Without Borders, Professional Fraternities (ASK, PSR, Theta Tau, etc), and Design for America to engage communities where engineers tend to spend time -- all in attempts to reach students in the communities they care about most. 

My platform is only as strong as the support it receives from the people. My direct aim is to create community dialogue on finding enactable positive change, and my time will be spent first and foremost towards creating that platform. My determination to create interdisciplinary communication will help lead those thoughts into action, but it starts with clear dialogue. 
","Walk in office hours continue to be effective during stay-at-home orders, as I’ve been doing in other leadership positions as of yet. My phone, email, Facebook and Zoom are all openly available (which I all check hyper-frequently), emails through the CoE listserv regarding my support for engineering students, and personal reach-outs to campus leaders so they know I’m keen to hearing their ideas. 
","I wish I had the chance this quarter to better get to know the others running for the CoE position -- I’m sure that any of us would be great candidates in creating real change for CoE students. I’m believe I’m qualified and truly believe that I would make a strong representative for our students, due to my engagement with the CoE faculty and advisors in creating the school’s first Independent Major, through my extracurricular connections across various communities throughout campus providing me with the instant ability to work with those groups, through my understanding of what engineering students are interested in, and that my visions for change aren’t deterred by the ability of previous Senates to enact change. A vote for Nadav Kempinski is a vote for direct focus on the population, rather than just the ideas within me. 
","Left-leaning
","Good: Given my time studying abroad during Fall, a frenzied Winter and an online Spring, I was unable to first-hand witness what the 70th Senate has accomplished. In the past I’ve witnessed a toxic environment within the Senate, providing a terrible role model for other campus leaders. I’ve heard the 70th Senate has provided a conducive environment for improving student conditions -- along with signalling support for this year’s important COLA wildcat strike -- I applaud their work.
","No: For transparency, I was born in Israel and have no interest in boycotting my country, my friends or my family who live there. I’ve attended both BDS meetings my first 2 years and witnessed the amount of sheer emotion that our campus brings to the conversation, and have no faith in policy’s ability to support campus through this emotional struggle. I’ve been in favor of conversation between both sides and finding common ground. I have stated before and would continue to support a complete divestment of the UC from companies who engage in warfare or human rights violations. ","Yes: It may not happen while we’re in our undergraduate studies, but cost-barriers have no place stopping bright minds who choose education. Grants and scholarships are nowhere near the service they need to be, and the method we utilize to test students’ ability to gain access to additional funding (ACT and SAT scores, their ability to write) are flawed. The UC will have to find alternative methods of funding, and a slow transition would need to occur, but I believe it is both possible and inevitable.","Far from adequate. When it’s common to hear that students who seek support are finding waiting times of weeks to months, for issues that are much more present and severe for students, there’s an obvious lacking in services for our size in population and need. This isn’t just on our campus -- the US and California are all lacking in support services and funding to meet the needs of students. We need to push for advocacy on the state and federal level for further funding, we need to push for innovation from our therapists and social workers, and we need to focus our on-campus resources to foster supportive communities. 
","Although I was abroad and not present to understand the situation, and I am lacking in the specifics of what occurred, it has been common knowledge that university campuses are ripe with sexual assault cases across the nation. It is imperative for campus administration to take all allegations of sexual assault seriously, to investigate community members’ potential lack of safety, and to ensure that students can feel comfortable in the greater community. A student body that does not feel comfortable in the midst of its fellow students needs to be addressed.","It’s been saddening to hear the sheer amount of cases that deal with Title IX on UCSB campus, and although I do not know the full extent that Title IX either supports or inhibits those who experience sexual assault, I will continue to be a supporter and ally for those who demand reform on our university campus to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in our homes, on our campus and in our community. Title IX’s role in increasing student engagement in campus-affiliated activities for all regardless of gender identity of expression should be maintained, and we should strive beyond federal policy to enable further engagement.","I don’t personally identify as a part of historically underrepresented communities on campus and therefore cannot speak for their experiences on campus and in the area, or as to whether our campus is providing the resources and outreach necessary for them to succeed. As a part of the Gaucho Tour Association, I’ve been impressed with our focus on outreach towards underrepresented communities and continuing our designation as #1 Hispanic Serving Institute in the United States, yet this is only one measure of the work we’re doing for one group of students. 

I feel that our campus is far from properly serving these communities as stratification between communities is extremely prevalent -- only a community that engages communally can be seen as a resilient one. I will support all measures that help bring underrepresented groups to the table, to ensure the presence of resources on campus allowing students’ access to information and support, and outreach programs that help inspire youth from communities across the state to consider higher education as accessible and offer financial support to do so. 
","Increased food access on campus. Buildings or facilities which see high levels of engagement from the student population should be given funds to offer healthy foods to the students who utilize the space. Considering for example the CAD Lab, a room which often sees 200 students filter through during a given day and spending hours for each visit, its department should be given the resources to offer students food so that they can focus on their studies without compromise on nutrition. I’d aim to work with the UC Global Food Initiative, the AS Food Bank, Calfresh representatives and the departments on campus to offer this program to students and ensure its effectiveness. 
","Students have their own activities and ongoings that are important to their lives -- we should focus on improving accessibility and transparency without increasing necessity or time commitment for keeping up on what’s going on. A simple revamp of the AS website from link-based information to dynamic offerings could provide clarity as to bill and resolution updates instead of the current web of broken links, offer up-to-date Senator Office Hours with locations, could provide all upcoming events and bill considerations in a clear fashion and offer the proper social media handles to contact for further information. Marketing of this single address would provide the resource necessary for students who are interested in engaging in Associated Students to do so, without further burdening the body with a legislative focus. I’d be happy to draft a site and seek approval for the integration.

Those who wish to become a part of AS should be kept up to date with all openings, and those aiming for candidacy into the Executive or Legislative branches should understand what actions are taken by students in those roles -- as a Senator I would work to provide transparency in role and action, to both inspire others to engage in the legislative process and to show that students in all positions of power on campus have the ability to inspire change. 
","The job of UC President is vast and as undergraduates we often don’t see the entirety of the role, but I would expect the next UC President to have the ability to negotiate with unions and students on campus without utilizing threatening tactics such as removing community members from the community. I fully supported the COLA wildcat strikes this past quarter and continue to do so, and will further my support for the people who work to make the day-to-day operations of this university possible.",,,,,,,
Surya Pugal,max,Engineering Senator,Independent,,,He/Him/His,2nd,Computer Science Major and Social Justice Minor,,,"When I first started at UCSB, I was daunted by the prospects of college, struggling to cope with being away from home while acclimating to a new environment. My first quarter was rough to say the least, as I found myself struggling with sleep deprivation, irregular meals, and an overwhelming pressure to succeed in my courses. However, it's because of the support of my professors and friends who've reached out to me that I've been able to make it this far and validate to myself that I do belong in this amazing community of like-minded engineers.
 I’m running for senate because I want to make sure that no student feels like they are less than, unworthy, or not enough. Sometimes the rigor of this university can easily make you feel like you’re not smart enough and that you somehow slipped through the cracks to get to where you are. Being in student government would give me a chance to be a part of the decision making process and advocate for my friends and peers. As cliche as it sounds, I’m running because I want to get the opportunity to use my skills and experiences to  work with the people around me and shape the university for the better. 
","I have been a tutor for five quarters for lower-division computer science courses, which and has given me the opportunity to hear out students’ concerns regarding the curriculum, as well as more personal concerns about coping with the workload and stress that accompany their courses. I have also been involved more recently in the CS Undergraduate Curriculum Restructuring Team, working in a team of five computer science undergrads under Professor Richert Wang to help reshape CS16, 24, and 32 (introductory sequence in computer science) to provide more engaging material to better immerse students in the learning experience and create projects which they can be proud of. We are also working to add a CS24 placement exam, to provide students who have taken AP Computer Science the opportunity to skip out of CS16. 

I am currently a member of the Engineering Student Council, an organization that seeks to promote recreational events on campus pertaining to engineering, as well as facilitate the interaction of different engineering clubs to promote more interclub spaces. In the future, I hope to promote workshops on how to procure research in engineering, something which is sorely lacking with COE and is more geared towards L&S students.
","I hope to introduce a bill to increase funding for tutoring programs pertaining to engineering on campus. The computer science tutoring program, for instance, is relatively new and the amount of tutors the program can accept is significantly limited by funding, resulting in tutors only being able to be serve lower division computer science courses (only in Winter 2020 were we able to get to expand the course to CS130B, in which tutors were in high demand). 

I also want to author a bill to promote the creation of a COVID-19 financial relief fund and creation of an accompanying committee pertaining to COVID-19 relief. Covid-19 is the single biggest issue that students currently faced and introduced a myriad of problems such as unprecedented job loss and increased xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment. We need to ensure that the UCSB learning environment is still accommodating of people’s financial needs, which for many has taken a turn for the worse in what appear to be uncertain times. 

Finally, I want to push for a bill to add mental health advisors within engineering advising, as students who are experiencing stress as a result of the large workload that may come with their questions will find it comforting to get not only practical, but personal support in the process of asking for help.
","My platform is rooted in educational access and mental health. My approach to addressing the issue of educational access is three-fold. First is increasing minority representation within STEM. To do this, I am  going to work with clubs dedicated to pushing for adequate representation of minorities. Also, I want to sponsor a bill in senate pertaining to a COVID-19 financial relief fund, allowing for students who are disproportionately affected by the circumstances that have arisen as a result of the pandemic to be able to still have access to a secure learning environment, with minimal burden. Finally, I want to expand existing tutoring programs to ensure that students are able to request for help from their peers in classes that are understaffed or extremely difficult. This pertains specifically to CLAS and the current undergraduate learning assistance program within COE
        
With regards to mental health, I want to push for imposter syndrome and anxiety workshops, which are prevalent within STEM. This will be done in conjunction with CAPS and Student Health. Furthermore, I’m seeking to introduce a bill to streamline the transition of mental health resources online.  All of this will help to destigmatize mental health and help students feel secure. 
","First, I want to work with CAPS to assist with improving existing mental health facilities and programs, as well as aiding with the online transition of mental health resources. Also, I’m hoping to collaborate with CAPS or the CS ULA’s (computer science undergraduate learning assistants) to increase and improve tutoring resources for the upcoming school year.

I will be additionally working with the Engineering Student Council, of which I am currently a member of to oversee engineering club activities as well as try and facilitate club collaboration, not just within COE to cultivate inter-club spaces. If elected, I’m also hoping to work with WiCS (Women in Computer Science), oSTEM, SWE (Society of Women Engineers), Los Ingenieros, and a number of other organizations dedicated to pushing for adequate representation of women, LGBTQ+, Latinx, and other minority groups within STEM. Also, to help students destress and provide recreational events, I’m seeking to collaborate with Tau Beta Pi and Theta Tau, who specialize in helping promote a welcoming environment for engineering students. Organizations like SBHacks and WomxnHacks, which provide a medium for the creation of engineering projects through hackathons, are also groups that I’m seeking to interact with. Finally, although not an organization, I’m hoping to work with the lower division computer science professors and faculty to get additional insight on what students need most.
","Firstly, I will hold office hours both through Zoom, depending on the status of COVID-19. I will also be available via appointment, and do my best to work around the schedules of others. I’ll also try and set up a website where students can address their concerns about particular issues. Other means of communication that students could contact me through would be email and phone call. Furthermore, if elected, I will seek out and work with like-minded and passionate students to determine what issues are important and propose solutions for said issues. For lower-division courses, I will try to contact professors and send out surveys at the beginning and end of each quarter to get student input about what issues are most important to them. Also, during the campaign process, I plan on making a Facebook group regarding my campaign and what I plan to do. If elected, I will use the group as another medium for students to get in touch with me to ask me questions. Although I’m still learning how to use Instagram and Snapchat, those are also viable means for students to voice their concerns or questions. Finally, I will work with the COE office to make routine email announcements for important issues.","I have done everything I can to the best of my ability, and if elected to Senate, will continue to pursue the same degree of hard work. If people vote for you to be in a position of authority, they are effectively putting their trust in you, something which I will not abuse. I am not faultless and make mistakes, but I will never hide this from the people I work -- transparency is key as a senator. 

Over the past five quarters I have tutored for computer science, I have been able to serve as not only a peer mentor but a personal friend for many. Being able to play a part in their successes has made me thankful for this gratifying job I have. I believe my empathetic nature will help me in understanding people’s needs when working with them. Most of all, being able to bring out the best in people brings out the best in me.

This university has provided me a home away from home, and being able to do my part in improving the campus would be an immense privilege. My policies, platforms, experiences, and organizational involvement reflect my personal character, something which I believe embodies what is needed for the College of Engineering senator position. 
","Left-leaning
","Good: The 70th senate has passed several bills, such as meal plans to provide options to roll over leftover meals and promote disarmament of I.V police, to the benefit of the student community. However, there is a lot more that needs to be done with regards to mental health and access to assistance with upper-division engineering courses. Very few, if any, resolutions focused on the engineering community have been passed, let alone discussed within this year’s senate. There needs to be more engagement between the engineering community and the senate representatives to ensure that appropriate needs are being met. 
","Yes: Any corporation that exploits the suffering of people for personal benefit must be held accountable. However, a large reason why the previous attempt to pass a resolution on this failed was due to concerns about encouraging anti-semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment. To avert concerns and ensure attempts at passing said bill are successful, I would do so under a blanket resolution calling for divestment from companies that profit from the perpetration of human rights abuses worldwide, and not just centered in Israel. Palantir, which recruits on UC campuses and has frequently aided ICE in their operations, is an example of this.","Yes: As a set of public institutions, the UC’s have an obligation to ensure unfettered access to education, regardless of income status. Existing financial aid programs, such as Pell Grants and Cal Grants, are not sufficient enough alone to address demonstrated financial need. At the very least, in light of current circumstances, students ought to see a significant reduction in tuition due to diminished access to campus resources.

Making UCSB tuition-free would both address the overwhelming accumulation of student debt and draw in more low-income applicants who otherwise perceived college as an unaffordable investment. 
","CAPS and Student Health have done an adequate job when it comes to taking care of students’ mental health issues. Student Health has put on a number of events dedicated to ensuring that the student body feels safe and is able to cope with the workload and stress that can prove overwhelming at times. Also, CAPS has offered facilities including counseling services and a mental health peers program, both of which have helped students in times of need. However, a large number of students are unaware about CAPS services, particularly within engineering. To address this issue, I plan on working with lower-division course professors to post information about CAPS on the class forums (Gauchospace, Piazza, etc.) as well as working with the mental health peers program to help advertise CAPS services during the first two weeks on lecture, when students are getting acquainted with their classes. Furthermore, I plan on working with select clubs (WiCS, oSteam, Los Ingenieros, SASE, etc.) as well as the CS office, to hold workshops about imposter syndrome and anxiety, to both destigmatize mental health and ensure that students never see themselves as unworthy or undeserving. In light of COVID-19, I also want to help introduce resolutions to help facilitate access to mental health services online to make sure needs are being met.
","There was a lot the university could and should have done with regards to addressing the reports of sexual violence on campus. The university states that rules and regulations that were in place prohibited them from responding faster, but the fact that sexual assault within fraternity spaces continues to be a recurring problem is indicative of the lack of proper regulations that have not been instituted and enforced by the administration. Firstly, we need to introduce regular workshops about sexual assault and consent, either in the form of a senator or in conjunction with Student Health. Current online info sessions are irregularly in place and as evidenced by recent events, have negligible impact on curbing sexual assault. Furthermore, we need an independent third party to oversee the IFC and major events conducted by fraternities to ensure all respective people are held accountable in a timely manner in situations where sexual violence arises. The current method of oversight has shown to be ineffective and only works as a temporary measure. 
","With the introduction of Title IX has come the decreased perpetuation of educational gender stereotypes and increased access to career opportunities for women. Nonetheless, Title IX alone is not an adequate measure for adressing sexual assault on college campuses. Despite its presence, we have observed a number of sexual assault cases within UCSB and has little to no effect on deterring sexual violence. Furthermore, the ambiguity in the way Title IX was easily exploited by the current presidential administration to promote, according to the New York Times, a strict definition of gender on a biological basis by using the person’s sex at birth. This conflation of gender and sex invalidates the presence of transgender students, as evidenced by UC Berkeley senator Isabella Chow’s refusal to affirm a bill to protect transgender students from violence as well as the more recent case of transphobia at a Sigma Nu party this Februrary. As mentioned in the response to question 13, UCSB must enact additional regulations on fraternity spaces, as well as push for an independent third party to work with the IFC. This way, we are able to reduce the number of sexual assault cases, as well as better hold all involved people responsible.
","UCSB has a number of different facilities dedicated to promoting a welcoming community for students of all backgrounds. From the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity to the various organizations pushing for representation of underrepresented communities within STEM and other exclusive spaces, UCSB has made a strong effort to combat discrimination within the community. However, the campus has also failed to take decisive action when it mattered most.

The anti-black rhetoric experienced by the BSU last February when meeting with administration to advocate for increased black student resources and the construction of a Malcolm X Center is one such glaring example. During a party hosted by Sigma Nu, the administration failed to immediately hold anyone accountable for the evident transphobia and bigotry first addressed on the subreddit r/UCSantaBarbara. And more recently, the perpetuation of COVID-19 related xenophobia, particularly within online forums pertaining to UCSB such as Free and For Sale, a Facebook group for selling items, have gone largely unaddressed by administration, despite the fact that news outlets such as the LA Times and USA TODAY have reported specifically on these incidents. Inaction should never be a valid course of action, and future ASUC senators need to call out when it happens. 

","If elected, the first resolution I intend to pass would be pushing for the institution and expansion of a COVID-19 Financial Relief Fund. Right now, COVID-19 is the biggest issue students face on campus, resulting in the transition to online resources, unprecedented job loss, and increased xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment. We need to ensure that the UCSB learning environment is still accommodating of people’s financial needs, which for many has taken a turn for the worse in what appear to be uncertain times. The resolution will be modeled off that of UC Berkeley’s, which was proposed in early April by Senator Romario. 
        To implement this, I hope to work with Student Affairs and well as clubs representing underrepresented communities, whom, as Senator Romario points out, will be disproportionately affected by the increased barriers in health and social services. The bill would also push for the creation of an independent committee to oversee the collection of funds accumulated from financial grants and crowdfunding. The committee would additionally aid in the online transition of certain organizations and resources, such as mental health (CAPS) and tutoring services (CLAS or alternative tutoring club). The resolution may be split into two resolutions if the scope ends up getting too large.
","One thing I would do is to increase engagement with clubs and organizations on campus. To do this, I would schedule a meeting time with all engineering-related clubs to address concerns they have. I would also facilitate additional club gatherings through ESC, or the Engineering Student Council, to provide a space for clubs to interact with one another and determine mutual needs. 
I also intend to draft meaningful resolutions within the engineering community, such as expanding our mental health program and CAPS capacities, as well as expanding tutoring capabilities of CLAS, the CS tutor program, and other clubs which provide tutoring services. Right now, not a lot has been achieved by the senate with regards to engineering, consequently resulting in a disconnect between the senate and the students which it serves. 
Also, allowing for students to readily access bills and resolutions provides a much needed sense of transparency and keeps students posted on where the senate and its members stand on particular issues of importance. One way to do this would be to provide a readily accessible link to find the bills and resolutions discussed by the senate on the website. 
Finally, offering polls and surveys within engineering courses during the start and end of each quarter regarding what issues students currently see as important and possible solutions that they would suggest would provide an outlet for students to voice their input and feel they are being heard.  
","The next UC president has to be a proponent for diversity within UC campuses and push for adequate representation of students from a variety of different backgrounds and experiences. This also calls for increased acceptance of in-state students, whose proportional acceptance rates have been decreasing over the past couple of years, as well as helping undocumented students at any UC with the aid they need. Certain college campuses have faced heavy criticism for enabling ICE operations, and we need to ensure that this is not the case for our successive president. He or she also needs to be able to adequately address the COLA movement, pertaining to ensuring adequate living conditions and wages for graduate student workers, and be willing to work with labor unions. Furthermore, said president needs to be decisive and frequently reach out to the student community to address common issues, something of utmost importance especially now given the increased social disconnect as a result of COVID-19. As Felicia Mello from CalMatters points out, the president’s “decisions will shape not only their institutions, but the future of public higher education in the state and nationally”, so we must ensure that whoever we pick truly has the students’ interests at heart.
