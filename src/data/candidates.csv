Taylor Tait,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Taylor-Tait-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,1st,Sociology & Geography Double Major,,,"I am running for Senate because I believe what our campus needs is someone who is compassionate and will listen to and value the ideas of all Gauchos, and not only a few select groups. I want to use my experience and privileges to provide a platform for underrepresented groups on campus to express their concerns. As you’ll read below, I am well qualified and have a lot of outstanding ideas that have pushed me to pursue a spot in the 71st senate. 
","Since coming to UCSB, I’ve become involved with a variety of organizations that have helped me grow and prepared me to be a senator. I joined RHA as an Activities Coordinator for Manzanita Village’s Hall Council. It was a great experience that helped me learn the ropes of on-campus politics on a much smaller scale than A.S. Senate. I’ve involved myself in various student activist groups, advocating for the banning of fracking in Santa Barbara and participating in many COLA protests. I also pushed myself to get involved in different communities of our school by joining Club Water Polo. Being a part of a club sport has helped me meet people I wouldn’t ordinarily get to, and has allowed for me to witness firsthand how A.S. impacts all of our students. 
","While in office, the main three issues I plan to address are food insecurity, combating climate change on a local and broader scale, and prioritizing mental health. In depth, I would like to increase funding for campus organizations that work to combat food insecurity such as the A.S. Food Bank. I hope to help these organizations grow so they have enough resources to support more of our student population and eventually expand the variety and multitudes of other life essentials such as toiletries and first aid. In regards to the climate crisis, I would like to enact resolutions that will promote environmental sustainability on our campus. I would like to accomplish this by instating campus policies such as reducing light pollution and energy waste in our campus buildings and refusing to support businesses involved in fracking, unethical palm oil, and other industries that are detrimental to our planet. And, importantly, I want to aid in the efforts to improve our mental health resources and make them easier to navigate through the creation of online apps, increasing funds, and a variety of other means.
","Efficiency and transparency best describe the foundation of my platform. Overall, I would consider my vision to be environmentally conscious and human rights oriented. Mainly, I hope to increase environmental sustainability efforts in our community by raising climate change awareness, bringing compost bins to popular areas on campus, and instating other practices that will help UCSB become a truly green campus. I also would like to address the reality of food insecurity on our campus by growing and expanding our AS food bank, making our farmer’s markets more accessible, allowing guests to use students’ meal swipes instead of charging it to their BARC account, and increasing the capacity of donating meal swipes. As a senator, I will also strive to increase recognition and transparency for all boards, committees, units, and other organizations on our campus. Every Gaucho, both big and small, deserves to have their voice heard. Advocating for improvement of our Student Health processes is something I also prioritize; I plan to start this action through conversations with our school administration. As a senator, I will strive to embody the ideals of all members of our Gaucho community. I’ll take on this position with openness in discussing and advocating for the concerns and well-being of our UCSB community. 
","There are so many incredible groups in our community, if there was enough time to join every board, committee, and unit I would in a heartbeat. But realistically, I hope to be able to work with the Food Bank, Environmental Affairs Board, and the Student Commission on Racial Equality. I would be excited to work in any organization or entity, but these are just a few that I would like to collaborate with in order to achieve the vision of my platform. 
","In the unfortunate instance that our summer and fall quarters move to be online, I plan on doing everything I can to be available and transparent to my constituents. Some of the ways I will do this are to hold weekly zoom office hours and be available for scheduling appointments, so that I have the opportunity to discuss concerns and ideas face to face with students. Additionally, I will be active on my senate Facebook, updating my page constantly with what happens in the Senate and the actions I take to better our community. 
","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I am driven, compassionate, and am eager to learn about and reflect the interests of our students. What our campus needs is someone who is dependable and will work in favor of all our students’ ideals. I’ve spent the past six years working in various leadership positions, growing to encompass a variety of skills that would make me perfect for this position. Some organizations I’ve had the privilege to work with include: Manzanita Hall Council (as an Activities Chair), WE Charity (as a School Liaison), Special Olympics (as a District-Wide Events Assistant Coordinator), and founding an environmental nonprofit that focuses on ocean conservation. Each of these positions has taught me what it means to be a leader and how to become a voice for the people. My work ethic would be best described as resilient, organized, and creative. I have a true passion for considering the perspectives and values of others and finding a way to incorporate them into the bigger picture. For all these reasons and more, I am well qualified and will thrive as your next On-Campus Senator.
","Left-leaning 
","Very Good; the 70th Senate has moved mountains in advocating in the students’ interest. They accomplished so much in the past year, from lobbying to increase various BCU funds and utilizing a sexual assault task force to better combat sexual violence in our community, to reaching beyond our campus to support students negatively affected by the Mauna Kea telescope contruction. What I appreciate about the efforts of our previous senate is how dedicated they were when it came to improving life beyond on-campus means. I want to build upon their work by collaborating with more organizations to provide them more transparency and opportunities. 
","This topic has been widely debated throughout the years at UCSB. Personally, I feel that I am not informed enough to take a position on this topic. What I will say is that UCSB would benefit from exploring the idea of establishing relationships with companies that are confirmed to be ethically sound. 
","It’s no argument that the tuition we students pay greatly supports the multitude of organizations and resources that make our university as great as it is. Although I am not completely confident of whether or not focusing the Senate’s time on abolishing tuition for UCSB is going to be effective, I firmly believe in advocating for reducing our tuition prices. Furthering this, scholarships and other forms of financial aid should be extremely expanded so that they can compensate for tuition and student fees. There needs to be more availability of scholarships so students who come from all backgrounds and classes can be supported. Financial hardships should not prevent people from gaining access to education. 
","From CAPS to Health and Wellness, our campus is blessed to have multiple resources where Gauchos can reach out for support. I especially appreciate how easy it is to discover Health and Wellness events as well as our school’s overall efforts to not only normalize maintaining mental health, but prioritizing it over social and even academic success. Overall, I believe that our mental health services are inadequate due to the large demand that has come to overwhelm our services. Every aspect of mental services I have encountered has proven to be incredibly popular and therefore busy. Resources can be difficult to navigate. Scheduling therapy appointments is a grueling task, especially considering the toll it takes on our students’ already full schedules. Even the crowds of pet therapy dogs during dead week were packed. What I propose is an increase in funding and support of mental health services and an exploration of possibly offering virtual therapy appointments. The foundation of our community is well being, and I stand for investing in every Gaucho’s mental health. 
","The speed of UCSB’s response could have been much faster. In the quarter system, it’s been shown that the fast pace causes things to fall through the cracks, so to speak. But sexual assault is no light matter, and should be addressed with exceptional urgency and care, especially when multiple cases arise in the span of weeks. As in any situation, there could have been things our university could have done to handle it better. Personally, I found the school wide emails, presented sometimes weeks after the incident, to be ill timed. More transparency with our administration's actions, and to really know that there are executives and organizations actively working to address these reports, could help ease the mind of our community in the possibility of future sexual assault cases. Furthermore, supporting organizations including Take Back the Night will help aid the university’s response and actions to sexual violence in our community.
","I believe that Title IX is a decent base for a system to address sexual assault. However, it’s merely a foundation for the complex and careful works that are needed to be put into place in order to smooth out the many flaws of this legislation. Currently, Title IX does a mediocre job in accepting the worth of sexual assault survivors. It also lacks an incentive for our justice system to approach and address these reports with the same speed and effort as any other criminal case. Especially when Title IX is implicated in communities where sexual assault cases are notoriously high, I believe that UCs absolutely need further legislation if they hope to create safer environments. There is more that could be done to improve upon how UC campuses approach these situations. 
","I don’t want to speak on behalf of these groups, but from what I have seen so far UCSB has made waves in representing and supporting its communities that are often underrepresented and mistreated. A variety of student unions, organizations, and specialty housing are features that are unparalleled to some universities in our country. Coming to UCSB, one of the first things that I found captivating was the normalization of introducing pronouns when meeting people. I believe that the little, everyday actions of recognition and inclusion form a massive impact on our community. Promoting this mindset will only strengthen our Gaucho community. As someone who grew up in a SoCal inland suburb, I found it surprising how little recognition our beautifully diverse groups, clubs, and organizations received. In high school, showcasing and supporting the BSU, Polynesian club, and disabled students was something I came to normalize; and with that came an appreciation and admiration for these underrepresented communities. In light of my experiences, I urge for bringing the spotlight to various historically underrepresented groups on campus and truly supporting all members of UCSB is absolutely vital. As a senator, I plan to support these well deserving groups and help them further their voices on our campus. 
","If I am elected to serve, one of the first bills or resolutions I plan on authoring would be to increase funding for organizations that aid against food insecurity. Specifically expanding resources and accessibility to the A.S. Food Bank, farmers market, and more. I feel that this is a priority of mine because food insecurity is a huge concern for many students, especially those who cannot afford the lofty costs of meal plans. Students should only have to focus on their studies and getting involved, not worrying over where their next meals are coming from. 
","As a senator, I would strive to make the everyday functions of A.S. more transparent by keeping our media even more up to date and opening up discussions of A.S. actions. As a first year, I’m still understanding all the ins and outs of A.S., and it’s difficult to grasp an adequate understanding of what A.S. does for our university if you don’t have friends who are older. It’s important to involve our younger Gauchos in campus politics so that they have a better understanding and appreciation of what makes our campus, and, eventually, they can help shape and improve upon the efforts of those who came before them. I hope to bring everyday routines of AS leaders through the means of social media, email, and other various platforms. 
","As we say farewell to President Janet Napolitano and the legacy she leaves, many Gauchos look towards the possibilities of the upcoming UC President. In light of the COLA protests, a priority I see for the next President is openness towards students and faculty. What troubled many with Janey Napoltano’s approach to COLA was her downwright rejection in speaking with students. We as investors of these institutions deserve to have our voices heard. Whomever the next UC President will be, I believe it should be someone to reflect all the needs of our diverse UC student bodies.

Adam Majcher,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Adam-Majcher-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,He/Him/His,1st,Political Science & History Double Major,,,"I am running to be Senator with the 71st Senate because I want to make UCSB a better place than it was when I arrived. Having been a fellow as part of the AS Pearman Fellowship Program this year, I have witnessed Senators make big, positive changes to the campus. Now I feel it’s my time to implement my own positive changes after watching so many people do great work. I have loved attending UCSB so far, this school has given me so much and I am dedicated to improving the student life here. While I adore UCSB, there is always more work to be done, and I have noticed a plethora of things that I think could make even better. Listening to my friends talk about various problems they have experienced, and noticing things myself like the difficulty in learning more about, joining, and advertising clubs inspired me to run for Senate
and make positive changes to things that I noticed were not functioning as well as they could be. I want to make the campus safer, increase student activity and engagement in the community, and make UCSB better than it already is, and I will achieve these goals as a Senator.","I have been a part of various clubs and organizations on campus, such as the Fencing team and IV Arts. However, the thing that I feel has prepared me the most to be a Senator is being a fellow for Senator Tyler Ferguson in the A.S. Fellowship Program. Learning about all parts of AS, including all of the various entities, responsibilities of various positions, requirements for writing a resolution, the resources available on campus, how clubs are financed, and countless other things has really prepared me for being a Senator, and I am very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the program. Furthermore, I have attended many Senate meetings throughout the school year, and have even been a Proxy for multiple Senators at meetings, so I understand how Senate functions and flows. This will put me ahead of a lot of my opponents, as I have the capability to enact meaningful change at the onset of the school year.","Some of my biggest goals as a Senator are creating a new app called the Gaucho Back app, creating a weekend long club rush event in Fall Quarter, overhauling the UCSB clubs website and adding a new “Club Events” tab to Go Gaucho! The Gaucho Back app resolutions would ask for funding in order to create the app (or, alternatively add its functionality to an already existing app like Shoreline if creating a new appproves difficult) and also to advertise it to the student body. This app would allow UCSB students in danger to press a button to immediately notify local authorities to come to their location, saving a lot of time. The goal of this app is to increase campus security by not only allowing a faster response time to any student in danger, but also to deter anyone from putting students in danger in the first place. The weekend long club rush event resolution would be the first resolution that I would write, because it is vital that the club rush event happens relatively early in the school year. This resolution would ask for funds for the various stands and advertisement required for the event to be successful, and I would be in contact with many clubs to get them on board to come and advertise themselves the weekend that it occurs! The club rush would include representatives of UCSB clubs having stands in an area, and students attending in order to learn more about them and potentially join these clubs if they are interested! Another resolution that I would introduce would be a big one that would ask for approval of a complete overhaul of the faulty and unhelpful UCSB club website, and also ask for the approval for a new tab on Go Gaucho that would list campus events that are happening that day/week!","My platform would primarily consist of the campus club overhaul, the introduction of new measures to ensure the safety of students, and the expansion of resources for anyone seeking mental, physical, or emotional help.For the campus club overhaul, I would work closely and communicate frequently with campus clubs in order to organize more events and places for advertisement and ease of communication. Things such as the club rush event that I am proposing cannot happen if the clubs that would be present at the event do not know about it, so it is going to be crucial that I am in constant contact with these groups and their leaders in order to make the entire campus club system better. Furthermore, I would work with the developers and project leads of the Go Gaucho app in order to expand it to include club events. For the Gaucho Back app, I would work with local police departments and CSO’s to plan out an effective way to create the app and their response to it. It is crucial that there is effective communication between UCSB and the local authorities in order to create this app system. Finally, for the expansion of resources for mental, emotional, and physical health, I would work with the Mental Health Task Force, would attend Mental Health Town Halls, and communicate with and work with various organizations on campus such as CAPS, CARE, Health and Wellness, and Student Health in order to spread information about ALL of the resources available to students, rather than just flood everyone into CAPS and have it be overwhelmed (although it is still important to increase the resources given to these organizations on top of spreading information).",See #4 above,"Communication with the student body is absolutely crucial for any Senator to effectively do their job, so should the shift to online courses continue into the Summer and Fall, I would make sure that I am able to be reached by students multiple times throughout the week. First of all, I would hold weekly scheduled zoom meetings for anyone who has ideas, suggestions, or problems that they would like for me to hear and address, and I would advertise these meetings on social media so that students would know about them. I would also hold individual zoom appointments throughout the week for any students who are interested, in order to ensure that every voice is heard. Furthermore, I would frequently post about updates and important events on social media, in order to keep the student body informed on all of the things happening within the Senate and AS as a whole. Additionally, I would have a Facebook or Instagram account specifically for myself as a Senator where I would be active and hold weekly discussion posts that students can comment on with any ideas and changes that they think would make UCSB a better place!","I think I am the best candidate for this position because I have the motivation, experience, and ideas necessary to effectively make the campus a better place while I am in office. I have been a part of AS throughout this year as a part of the Fellowship program, and through this I have gained tons of knowledge on how AS, and specifically the Senate, runs and functions. I am familiar with how meetings flow and how to write bills and resolutions, so I am experienced enough to effectively utilize the position in order to make positive changes for the campus! Furthermore, I have a lot of ideas based on my own firsthand experience, and the experiences of my friends and various UCSB students that can greatly improve student life, especially for first year students like myself, in the coming years. Something like the Gaucho Back app can greatly help increase campus safety, and the revamp to the UCSB club website and introduction of events on the Gaucho Back app can substantially increase student engagement with the campus, and both are relatively creative ideas that can increase the quality of campus life substantially. I am also extremely motivated to make these changes happen! I have watched the 70th Senate be extremely impactful and make tons of positive changes in the past few months, and I’m ready and excited to create positive change for the school myself!","left-leaning 
","Very Good. Having attended many Senate meetings and witnessing various legislation that passed, I do think that the 70th Senate did a very good job at addressing the needs of the student body. From bills such as the International Student Bill to demanding rollover swipes, from passionately advocating for increased campus security to supporting the COLA strike, I think that this year’s Senate actively represented the wants and needs of the student body. I do wish that the 70th Senate focused a bit more at improving mental health facilities and spreading information regarding campus resources, however.","While I fully acknowledge the importance of the issue of divestment, I think there is too much gray area on both sides of the argument to take a firm “yes” or “no” stance. I look forward to learning more about the issue and consulting students to make a decision that best represents the stance of the student body.","Yes. I do believe that in an ideal world, education of all levels should be tuition free and readily available for anyone who chooses that path. However, until a better system is established nationwide and/or in California, some form of tuition is necessary to keep UCSB running and, especially, to give faculty a satisfactory paycheck. I believe the problem is moreso in the higher government of the United States rather than UCSB itself, and that tuition free education for all at UCSB is very difficult to achieve by the school itself. Rather, United States politics must fundamentally change.","No, the mental health services at UCSB are far from adequate. A friend of mine who was seeking an appointment at CAPS was told to wait in a multi-hour line just to sign up for a three month waitlist! Efforts such as dog therapy days and massage chairs are admirable, but far from adequate for a University that is home to over 20,000 students and requires the completion of multiple mental health modules for first year students. An important part of my campaign is to substantially increase the funds given to CAPS, greatly increasing the amount of staff in the facility, which in turn would help with the ridiculous wait times. Furthermore, I aim to expand the resources available to victims of physical, emotional, and sexual violence and spread information about their existence so that students are able to know about them should they ever need them. Additionally, there are many resources available to UCSB students that are poorly advertised by the school that offer services similar to those of CAPS. Groups such as the Mental Health Task Force and events such as Mental Health Town Halls are trying to spread information regarding things such as the Alcohol and Drug Program, Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), Health and Wellness, and Student Health Services. As a Senator, I would continue the efforts of these organizations, and work with these programs to continue improving the mental health counseling available for students!","Yes, the university could have handled the situation much, much better. While the complaints that the response was slow are entirely valid and accurate, I think the bigger failure was that the university did absolutely nothing to prevent potential future incidents of sexual assault on campus. UCSB needs to take a proactive rather than a reactive approach to physical and sexual assault, actively taking measures to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place rather than simply giving a delayed response that does not fix anything after horrible incidents like this happen. One of the most important parts of my campaign is the creation of an app (ideally named Gaucho Back) that has an emergency distress button that immediately notifies local authorities to come to one’s location. The presence of such an app that allows for extremely quick action would not only deter people from committing acts of assault, but it would also allow for help to come much faster than something like calling 911. Furthermore, there needs to be more resources on campus for victims of assault, something that I will focus on improving should I be elected to the Senate. There have been multiple cases of sexual and physical violence on or near our campus in the past year, and it is vital that these individuals receive the help and support that they need. Another big part of my campaign is spreading information about and advertising various clubs, organizations, and facilities on campus, and giving students the information of the existence of such resources for victims of assault can greatly help in them being utilized for students to receive the help that they need.","Title IX is not an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. While the law was a relatively effective as a stepping stone in the goal of creating campuses free of various types of discrimination, it fails to specifically account for many detrimental issues, such as sexual assault and transphobia. Furthermore, with the current political administration’s continuous efforts to reverse protections of Title IX, especially regarding transgender students and the investigation of sexual assault cases, the law is not powerful enough nor specific enough to effectively prevent sexual discrimination on college campuses, much less sexual assault. There needs to be more provisions put in place to guarantee that all sexual assault cases are thoroughly investigated, that transgender students are provided rights that are associated with the gender that they identify with, and clearer, more defined laws to prevent sexual discrimination and sexual assault. It is imperative that there are better measures implemented by the school to combat sexual assault on our campus, and a key part of my campaign, the implementation of an app that allows a UCSB student to immediately send a distress signal to local authorities, notifying them to immediately come to that student’s location, would go a long way in helping with this.","Part of what makes UCSB so special is how diverse the backgrounds of the community are, and how students from all over the world and from completely different walks of life are able to come together to learn and create an amazing community. As a gay student myself, I personally have never experienced any forms of harassment or discrimination directed at me at UCSB, and there are numerous resources that I am aware of for the LGBTQ+ community on campus, which is something that I do think UCSB is doing quite well. I am a strong believer in equity over equality, and, while there are many resources and groups available at UCSB for students who are members of historically underrepresented groups, more work can always be done. It is important to remember that members of racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities very disproportionately account for cases of violence and abuse both on college campuses and in the United States at large. This is just another reason why it is so crucial to effectively deal with and prevent cases of physical and sexual violence from occuring on our campus, and why UCSB’s response to the multiple cases of sexual assault and the case of anti-LGBTQ+ violence that occurred this year was so unacceptable and inadequate. Taking a proactive stance and creating measures that would prevent instances of violence from occurring in the first place is crucial to the wellbeing of the community, and, again, the Gaucho Back app would be a great place to start. The International Student Bill that I was a student sponsor for is a crucial step in increasing the inclusivity of A.S. and ensuring that all groups on campus have a voice and are represented, as international students have historically been extremely underrepresented within student government at UCSB. Finally, I will make sure to be in constant contact with students from all backgrounds in order to effectively represent and respond to the needs of the student body. I will do everything in my power as a Senator to ensure that every student has a voice, feels safe, and is represented during their time at UCSB.","While I believe that the creation of the Gaucho Back app is very important, the first thing that I would pass is an overhaul to the campus club website and the creation of a club rush weekend within the first quarter of the school year. One of my biggest goals as a Senator would be to increase the information spread of events, clubs, and facilities, and these organizations usually recruit towards the start of the school year, so focusing on this would be my first priority as it is so frontloaded in the school year. One of the biggest problems that I experienced at UCSB is the difficulty of finding, advertising, and joining clubs. There were small club joining events during the weekday that lasted an hour or two, and I had class during them. The clubs that are usually lining the path by the arbor are just a fraction of all the ones present on campus. I would work with club leaders to establish a “club rush” weekend where clubs would have stands in a large open space, and students would see flyers for it all over campus and be able to attend, learn about, and join various clubs on campus. Furthermore, the website for clubs is a bit of a mess as it is difficult to navigate and has little to no information about any of the clubs that are listed. Having a club database online would help students find, learn more about, and reach out to clubs that they are interested in and join them in order to get more involved in campus life during their first, and subsequent, years. Finally, I often see friends going to incredible events going on around campus on social media that I never even realized were happening! As Senator, I would push for an extra tab on the Go Gaucho app that would list all events that are occurring within the week. This free advertisement would greatly help spread information about the events that students and members of the UCSB community are hosting, and make the information for them easily accessible for the student body. The success of UCSB as a campus is largely linked to the engagement and involvement of the student body in campus activities. Bolstering this and the entire system around it can only help improve life for the whole community!","As mentioned above, one of my biggest goals as a Senator would be to greatly increase the information present regarding clubs and campus events, and this includes A.S. A.S. events would similarly be listed on the Go Gaucho app, alongside other community events, and the ability to sit in on Senate meetings or attend Senator or Executive office hours would be made much more public in an attempt to get more students involved in A.S. activities. Furthermore, social media is crucial in communicating to the student body, and I would frequently post about important events or bills that are being discussed in order to get students more involved and encourage them to come to speak at Senate meetings about their thoughts, concerns, and suggestions. The school newspaper covers important and groundbreaking updates that happen in A.S., and as a Senator I would work with various on campus media sources in order to publicize events happening in the school. Communication and information are crucial in not only informing the student body of what their representatives are doing in office, but also to encourage students to take an active part in their community and have a say where their money goes to.","The top priorities for the next UC President is to, first and foremost, listen to the students and faculty of UC campuses and react effectively with their concerns and needs. Campus safety must be a top priority, especially given the physical and sexual violence that has occurred within the past school year. Furthermore, with huge events such as the COLA strike and COVID-19 outbreak currently happening, the next UC President must react well to being under pressure, and be ready to address crises that can sprout at any moment. The students at UC universities must be the top priority of the next UC President, and our safety and education should be their top concern. Communication between the UC President and the students is vital, and assembling town hall style events with UC students could be a great way for them to learn about our concerns, complaints, and suggestions. Addressing current issues such as the COVID-19 outbreak and how it affects our campuses and meeting the needs of Graduate students who are receiving wages below the poverty line are both crucial in the moment, however, I think that most importantly the next UC President must be willing to communicate and cooperate with students and faculty in order to resolve these problems and any future ones that may occur.",,,,"My platform would primarily consist of the campus club overhaul, the introduction of new measures to ensure the safety of students, and the expansion of resources for anyone seeking mental, physical, or emotional help.For the campus club overhaul, I would work closely and communicate frequently with campus clubs in order to organize more events and places for advertisement and ease of communication. Things such as the club rush event that I am proposing cannot happen if the clubs that would be present at the event do not know about it, so it is going to be crucial that I am in constant contact with these groups and their leaders in order to make the entire campus club system better. Furthermore, I would work with the developers and project leads of the Go Gaucho app in order to expand it to include club events. For the Gaucho Back app, I would work with local police departments and CSO’s to plan out an effective way to create the app and their response to it. It is crucial that there is effective communication between UCSB and the local authorities in order to create this app system. Finally, for the expansion of resources for mental, emotional, and physical health, I would work with the Mental Health Task Force, would attend Mental Health Town Halls, and communicate with and work with various organizations on campus such as CAPS, CARE, Health and Wellness, and Student Health in order to spread information about ALL of the resources available to students, rather than just flood everyone into CAPS and have it be overwhelmed (although it is still important to increase the resources given to these organizations on top of spreading information).",,,
Adam Bagul,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Adam-Bagul-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,1st,History of Public Policy and Law,,,"I am running to be an on-campus senator with the 71st senate for a wide variety of reasons.
Civic service is an incredibly powerful idea and practice, it improves the quality of the
communities and people that are lucky enough to enjoy it. Service is a significant ideal that I
foresee continuing to drive me in my life and one that I will hold dear. However, it is only
worthwhile if there are people and ideas that are worth serving. I am so grateful to find myself
at UCSB where there are no shortages of people and ideas to advocate for and service roles in
which to do so. AS Senate is a wonderful place to work through both of those needs, being
privileged enough to serve by advocating for those students and issues that deserve it.
Additionally, I have an innate passion for leadership. I love being a part of something bigger
than myself, even more so being more involved and holding responsibilities that maintaining a
leadership position carries. Leaving high school I joined the United States Marine Corps, in
basic training I felt compelled to go beyond expectations and I soon found myself in a squad
leader billet. I held that billet until graduation and earned a meritorious promotion. This was
the beginning of understanding and realizing my passion for leadership. I still currently hold a
leadership billet in the Marines and deeply enjoy leading my marines as well as mentoring,
caring for, and holding them accountable. When I arrived at UCSB I found myself at an
informational meeting regarding Hall Council. Go big or go home, right? I ran for Hall Council
President and have been fortunate enough to win and serve during the 2019 - 2020 school year.
I have found that while student leadership is much different than leadership in the Marine
Corps, my enthusiasm for it remains all the same. I want to continue to chase my passion for
leadership and what better way than to increase the scope and be a part of a group of
representatives for all UCSB students. The amount of reasons I have for running for senate
goes on and on and include but are certainly not limited to, meeting more of my peers at
UCSB, challenging myself in both running and maintaining the senate position, and the
personal and professional development that will occur no matter the result of elections.","In my role as San Rafael Hall Council President I have been involved with two organizations
that while similar in function, prepared me for a position as an on-campus senator in different
yet overlapping ways. As San Rafael Hall Council President I worked closely with the
Residential Housing Association, or RHA, and San Rafael’s very own Hall Council. In
working with RHA I learned the basics of being in a legislative body, such as parliamentary
procedure or parli pro. Working and volunteering on different committees within RHA aided
me in gaining more experience with collaboration with other students on non-academic
projects and learning more about UCSB and life on campus in general. Attending weekly
coordinating board meetings within RHA exposed me to many different student organizations
and the events they host that make UCSB such an exciting community to participate in. Hall
Council on the other hand gave me experience holding a more administrative role in a student
government setting, such as being responsible for holding weekly executive and coordinating
board meetings and office hours. Both RHA and my Hall Council have prepared me to be an
on-campus senator in teaching me the issues that are common in residence halls and with on
campus students as well as many of the resources that are available to alleviate or move
forward with said issues.","Of my platform the three most important issues to me are resolving the inefficiency regarding
veterans’ benefits, urging the university to create more composting bins, and subsidizing /
lowering the cost of on campus parking. Regarding the first, I would begin researching further
into the details and deficiencies in the process that is leading to the hold up. During these early
stages I will likely find a student sponsor, likely another student veteran. The resolution itself
would roughly be along the lines of, “Whereas it is the responsibility of UCSB to certify
necessary documents in a timely manner, and; this has not been the case in recent years.
Therefore let it be resolved by the Associated Students in the Legislative Council assembled:
That the student body of the University of California, Santa Barbara strongly urges the
University to hire the necessary additional staff / correct the deficiencies and hold those
responsible for those delays accountable”. The second bill being related to additional compost
bins on campus would also begin with research and collaboration with related organizations
and departments at UCSB. The resolution itself would likely be one of support: “Whereas,
UCSB has committed itself to striving towards being zero waste, and compost bins are an
effective way to further this effort, and campus presently does not compost bins close to many
on campus residence halls. Therefore let it be resolved by the Associated Students in the
Legislative Council assembled: That the student body of UCSB supports the proposed plan to
create more composting bins on campus”. The third resolution would start no different than the
other two, with research and talking with related departments namely the Transportation and

Parking Services. This resolution / bill is harder to speculate on details because there are many
unknowns that will be answered with further research but if the UCSB is unwilling to negotiate
lowering parking permit prices then a conversation will ensue both within AS and with myself
and RHA to see if our organizations could subsidize a realistic amount of the cost. All of these
bills are rather difficult to “detail” because the ideas have multiple paths that have yet to be
revealed.","My platform consists of four main points, which I will lay out in a nonspecific order. I aim to
diminish parking costs while serving in AS Senate, through collaboration with the Office of
Transportation and Parking Services and RHA. This will most likely start through contacting the
Office of Transportation & Parking Services and Parking Rate Payers Board to inquire as to why
parking is priced as it currently stands and other relevant details. With updated and more specific
information I as well as other interested senators will most likely formulate the next course of
action whether it be trying to foster collaboration between AS and RHA to help subsidize
parking costs or putting heavy pressure on the university to lower these costs. Pushing for access
of the 200 free prints that students are allotted to be extended to the ResNet Printers in the
Residence Halls can be accomplished through speaking with the Housing Department and
Gaucho Print. Through entering a dialogue with both of these entities, we can better understand
why ResNet Printers are not included in this resource and take steps to try and include them.
Again reaching out to RHA for support in this matter would be incredibly helpful and only help
the chances of this idea becoming a reality. Urging UCSB to add more compost bins on campus
in order to help our campus further responsible environmental practices. This piece of platform
will require coming into contact and working with many departments at UCSB such as Facilities,
Sustainability, student and university organizations focused around environmental sustainability /
composting, and within AS itself with the office of the EVPLA and interested senators. Like
most issues in order to effectively take on this challenge information regarding the problem itself
and the roadmap to achieve the desired endstate is crucial to its success. Facilities and
Sustainability will yield information regarding how we can set up and begin the process, relying
on the other environmental organizations for help and support. Last but certainly not least, an
essential part of my platform would be advocating for student veterans by putting pressure on
university administration to hire the necessary staff and implement necessary changes so that
student veterans never get their benefits late again. I plan on learning more specifics regarding
the problem through talking to the SVO, other student veterans, and going through the process
myself. After learning more about where the deficiencies in the process occur, pressure and

urging UCSB to correct the problem will be more effective and better directed whether it be
through a bill, resolution, petition, changes made in operations and procedures, etc.","There are a multitude of organizations that I aim to collaborate with within my term as senator,
many directly pertaining to the issues and pieces of my platform that intensely hold my
attention. For example I hope to work with the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board, the
California Student Sustainability Coalition, The IV Compost Collective run by IVCSD, UCSB
Sustainability / Student E-Coalition, Zero Waste Committee, and other similar organizations.
Through working with these organizations I hope that we can further awareness, gain wide
support in favor of, and ultimately push UCSB to place more compost bins on campus. Time
and time again I have seen compostable food waste mismanaged by either being placed in the
garbage or left in the grass all over UCSB. Our university should continue striving to be zero
waste and investing in more compostable bins is a significant step towards that goal. Another
group of organizations that I would like to collaborate with are the Office of Transportation
and Parking and RHA. I believe that On-Campus students pay far too much for university
parking spots and through opening a dialogue / working with these entities change can be made
to lower or further subsidize parking costs. Additionally, a huge personally important issue that
I hope to resolve is the tardiness of tuition assistance that many student veterans are entitled to
and depend upon. I will be seeking advice, collaboration, and assistance with the Student
Veteran Organization, Military Family Organization, and Veteran Resource Center to make
sure this problem is resolved and does not persist.","It is clearly a difficult time for all UCSB students operating remotely and not being able to
enjoy the school that we hold so dear. Aside from not being in Isla Vista, seeing your friends,
and feeling normal these circumstances make access to TAs, professors, and on campus
resources more difficult and in some cases non-existent. The same applies to AS Senators,
however it is easy and more importantly senators’ responsibility to make themselves more
easily available if online courses continue through summer and fall quarter. Very similar to
quality TAs and professors, I would be open to hosting office hours weekly through Zoom for
any UCSB students that would prefer that form of communication. I would also be incredibly
vigilant with my school email and would respond to emails promptly. In addition to Zoom
office hours and reaching out through email, I plan on being incredibly present on my Senator

Facebook page and all social media. I think the use of social media and especially a Senator
Facebook page may offer a more approachable and personable way to get in contact with
constituents. In these unprecedented times of isolation, communication is key and as a senator I
do not plan on forgetting that whether I am on-campus or not as I greatly look forward to
speaking with fellow UCSB students.","I am the best candidate for the on-campus senate position because of my leadership experience
and determined hardworking nature. My time in RHA and Hall Council have taught me many of
the problems that are common in on-campus living. RHA and Hall Council have also introduced
me to many resources that are available to help on-campus students. An important part of being a
leader is being able to maintain a cool and level head in high stress situations, a skill that I am
very familiar with as I have and continue to lead marines during dynamic live fire exercises.
Situations like the one we are facing together all over the world highlights the need for level
headed leaders who will not get overwhelmed when stakes are high. I have proven to my
marines, my fellow RHA members, Hall Council members and more importantly myself that I
am an effective leader and I will continue to be as a senator. My mother once told me if you’re
not giving something one hundred percent, then why do it? When I set myself to a goal or
commitment I make sure that I give it my full effort. I am the best candidate for the position
because I am capable of filling the role more effectively than other candidates and if elected I
will put maximum effort in being the best senator I can be.","Other. I’m independent, I really don’t subscribe to solely left or right wing points of view.
Additionally, I do not allow my political beliefs affect my judgement when working in a
representative role, I will be focused on the opinions of my constituents rather than my own.","Good. As a first year that is very new into involvement with AS, as far as I can tell they’ve

done well. I was very pleased to hear about the resolution regarding roll over swipes in the
dining commons which is a change that is overdue. Additionally I have not heard any major
scandals or deficiencies in AS Senate this year so I do not have any negative judgement to
pass. However, on the other side of not hearing much about AS, it seems that the Senate and
AS in general needs to put a greater focus on awareness into current AS events and resolutions
/ bills. Many students, myself included, are not well informed on AS’s work and that in of
itself is a problem as they have a responsibility to effectively communicate their progress.","OTHER. I hope to learn more during my time as a senator so I can pass more informed
judgement if the vote comes up once again.","No. While every student, myself included, would be ecstatic to no longer pay tuition I do
not believe that it is feasible. Tuition accounts for an incredibly large portion of the
University’s income and is responsible for funding the bulk of virtually everything at UCSB.
Additionally I do not foresee California miraculously volunteering to fund all the UC’s out of
nowhere. I do believe that the UC has the means to significantly lower tuition and should do
so. Tuition-free attendance would be preferred, but it is not realistic at this time. There needs to
be a balance between too expensive and free, and unfortunately it is clear that it is presently
heavily skewed toward the former.","I am aware that the University’s Counseling and Psychological Services or “CAPS” is a very
well known and advertised resource on campus. CAPS is said to offer professional counselors
and therapists as well as help from other students called “mental health peers”. While the staff
and all the resources at CAPS are incredibly appreciated by the students of UCSB it is clear

that CAPS is failing to serve the needs of UCSB students in many respects. There is a dire
shortage in staff at CAPS, specifically licensed counselors and therapists, contributing to
incredibly long wait times. The shortage in therapists and counselors is also demonstrated in
CAPS’s outsourcing of some service to Acacia Counseling and Wellness. Outsourcing some
service is better than inaction and adding to the already extensive waitlist that students must
contend with, but with the resources that UCSB holds CAPS should be better equipped to
handle students’ needs. Additionally, roughly over 12 percent of the student population at UC
Santa Barbara are international students, the majority of them from China. Keeping UCSB’s
large Chinese student population one would think that there would be a counselor or therapist
that can help these students in Mandarin or Cantonese. Unfortunately this is not the case, this
essential resource is less accessible to a huge segment of our student body, who are away from
home in a country much different from their own with all the added academic stress that any
college student faces. Subsequently, I believe that action needs to be taken to resolve this
deficiency.","UC Santa Barbara’s response to the multiple reports of sexual assault occuring on fraternity
property during the 2019 fall quarter could have been better, specifically in timing. The rape at
the Sigma Pi house took place in early October. The University first responded to the reports of
the incidents by using the timely warning system, emailing all students on October 17th. In this
email they informed students that two incidents of sexual assault took place with a minor
description giving some details, following safety tips and resources. This email was sent far too
late, there is no reason why this email was received by students over a week and a half later.
The next day the IFC announced that they had put a 5 day moratorium on all fraternity social
activities. This decision also came too late and did not go far enough. They later changed the
moratorium to be indefinitely which I believe was the right call. On October 28, the university
sent out another timely warning email again giving a brief description, a description of the
suspect, and revealing that it had taken place at Sigma Pi. This is also far too late for a follow
up email to be sent especially if it is releasing pertinent information that may have been
necessary to include in the first email. UCSB later held a forum in November to address
students’ concerns. I believe this is also far too late and the university’s general focus on
women defending themselves rather than the root cause is concerning as well. Simply put I
think UCSB took most of the right steps, all extremely late making it lose much of its
effectiveness.","I do not believe that Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses.
As it stands Title IX itself is a sound and solid law in terms of setting the framework of
provisions and directives to work through cases of sexual assault, however the most important
part of its effectiveness is enforcement and implementation. Objectively, the enforcement of
Title IX in regards to the intensity of universities across the country in their response has been
drawn back in the transition between the Obama to Trump administration. This change is
propagated significantly in part by Department of Education Secretary Betsy Devos. It is
difficult to quantify the change in response from the change in administration, but nevertheless
it is still present. I strongly believe that it is not a smart or moral decision to scale back
intensity of sexual violence investigations or reprecussions in any case. The system that Title
IX has put into place can also put stress on survivors or victims of sexual assault who may not
want to move forward legally and disclose the details of their assault. In these cases CARE
works as a vital supplement to the system in place, allowing victims to work through emotional
trauma without disclosing information to mandated reporters who are required to come forward
to law enforcement.","While I do believe that there is always progress to be made and concerns that need to be
addressed, I do believe that at a fundamental level UCSB is serving historically
underrepresented groups. These groups include minority communities ranging from Latinx,
Black, Korean, Chinese, Middle Eastern and many more, to the LGBTQ+ community. The
administration and the community strongly supports these groups as seen through the support
given to organizations such as Black Student Union, Korean-American Student Association,
Queer Student Union, Vietnamese Student Association and many more. In my time in
Residential Housing Association, I’ve seen many different minority organizations come
through to ask for support or funding, the vast majority receive the entirety of their funding
requests and those who do not receive full funding usually receive partial funding. Apart from
student lead organizations the school’s own resources such as the Black Resource Center, The

Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, El Centro, and the Multi-Cultural Center
shows the University’s commitment to these historically underrepresented communities. The
progress and efforts that the university has made are not the end all be all to action that can be
taken. I believe that many underrepresented communities have needs that aren’t being
addressed and I want to champion that.","If elected to serve on Senate, my first bill or resolution that I would plan to author would
definitely concern student veterans. It is not an issue that is widely known or talked about on
campus, regardless it is still present. UCSB has not been processing Veteran’s benefits on time
leaving student veterans with much added stress affecting them academically, emotionally, and
most of all financially. Most people are aware that veterans usually attend university for free
because of earned benefits through their service, and this generally is the case if they choose to
use their benefits. However, through talking to other student veterans who have been at UCSB
longer than I have I have found out that the UCSB does not have enough staff to certify
documents in order to process benefits. Benefits are being processed late for many student
veterans leaving them to pay high unexpected costs until financial aid comes in, one student
veteran even having to take out a personal loan to cover tuition in the meantime. Needless to
say, my first resolution would be interested in hiring the necessary staff to certify VA benefits
and pushing the administration to hold those failing to do so accountable. As it is time sensitive
and a recurring problem that veterans should not have to meet friction with.","When I first began writing my response to this question I began describing holding an event at
least once a quarter, similar in nature to a social but its primary focus being to bridge the gap
between students and AS. I detailed that the meetings could start with a brief overview on past
ongoing, and future actions in AS Senate as well as giving general information regarding all
the opportunities and resources in AS, later giving time for students to meet with senators and
express ideas, concerns, and observations. These events already exist, they are called forums
and they are required by legal code in AS. I am glad that this concept is a reality, however how
effective can forums be if they are not well known or advertised. In order to mitigate the
feelings of inaccessibility towards Associated Students I aim to focus energy and effort to raise
awareness regarding forums and improve them further by looking into how they currently

function. A system in which senators can inform and involve the general student body and also
receive feedback and ideas from their constituency is only effective if there are students who
are aware of this resource and participate in using it.","I believe that the next UC President should embody what the University of California should
stand for: the education and wellbeing of students, staff, and community instead of corporate
interests. It seems more and more that universities across the country are shifting their concern
for profit instead of their purpose, students, and faculty. The next UC President should make it
a priority to move the UC in the opposite direction, away from this shameful trend. President
Napolitano’s successor should immediately be making an effort to lower tuition AND taking
steps to secure more resources for all UC campuses. A concrete example of this may include
but certainly is not limited to, working to reimburse part of students' 2020 Spring Quarter
tuition as online classes pale in comparison to the value of in person classes and the resources
being physically present on campus includes. President Napolitano’s successor should also
educate themselves on the 2020 Winter Quarter COLA strikes. Through becoming further
informed on the details of the situation, I hope that they will come to understand that graduate
students are a clearly essential component to our system and deserve a livable wage that is
appropriate compared to local living costs. COLA being a subject in which it seems President
Janet Napolitano has fallen short, it would seem necessary that her successor should correct
this situation.",,,,,,,

have the resources to succeed. I believe that as students, we have the power to revolutionize the
student body and continuously work to ensure there is equity with the resources available. I want
to ensure that each gaucho feels safe, is healthy, and most importantly can call UCSB their
second home. I want to ensure that each individual on campus can go to organizations that best
help them develop their sense of community and are represented in our senate. I want to be a
senator to be able to listen to the concerns of the community while listening and coordinating a
plan for change because everyone in this community is important to me. I am running for senator
because I want my LGBTQ++ community to feel empowered to be who they are and not feel
afraid to embrace their true self. I want to aid in the assistance of bills that will preserve the
literature of people of color and continue to have safe spaces for all of my fellow gauchos. I am
running to fight for low-income students, undocumented, and first-generation students who feel
that they do not belong when in fact they do and advocate for lower tuition and more funding.
Most importantly, I am fighting for the students who are fighting their mental illness in the open
and who feel like they are incapable of greatness. I am running for senate to help my community
which includes all of my fellow gauchos. Let's make UCSB a better place than it was before.","As an Associated Students’ Pearson intern and San Miguel residence executive member I have
been able to learn how to effectively work with others, become more goal-oriented and ensure
everyone’s voice is heard. In Associated Students, I learned how change does not happen from
one month to another, but instead happens with hard work, dedication, and persistence. I was
able to learn how to initiate detail oriented plans and become very detailed in plans to initiate

and learned the importance of persistence because our actions will positively impact our current
and future gauchos. In Hall council, I was able to learn how to refine my leadership skills and
continuously improve by having everyone’s’ ideas incorporated. I was able to plan events that
target specific groups such as first-generation and learning communities on campus to promote
collectivism and inclusivity. Hall council allowed me to learn how to work with others who had
different views from mine and separate the differences to work together towards a common goal.","One of the bills I would like to introduce includes a bill that will provide reasonable
accommodations to students who are experiencing difficulties that are not part of the Disabled
Students Program. I have talked to several individuals who have told me about the deaths of their
family members and were not able to receive accommodations. I believe that any type of
personal/family emergency should receive accommodation especially if there is documentation
as evidence. I will create a bill that will give a specific time frame depending on the type of
situation and will not give faculty more power than they already hold. The bill will be part of the
academic policies and will ensure personal emergencies will not jeopardize students’ grades. The
second bill I would like to introduce is a bill that will make attendance optional. Many students
on campus need to work to afford tuition, need to assist their families, and have different
learning styles therefore students should have the option to miss class without jeopardizing their
grade by 5-10%. I would also like to introduce a resolution that will allocate funding to increase
the mental health peers in the residence halls. By gathering student support from various health
organizations and working closely with RHA, students will be able to seek the mental health
resources needed when dealing with stress, hardship, and transitioning from high school to
college.","My platform is based on mental health, food security, and increasing education equity by
allowing students to receive proper accommodations in emergencies and not be penalized for not
attending class. In terms of mental health, I want to continuously improve this by expanding
mental health peers in the residence halls. I believe that providing more accessibility in the
residence halls can allow first and second years to improve their sense of home, thrive, and
continuously improve their mental health by having a designated area in the residence halls. Part
of my mental illness platform includes training resident assistants in the residence halls to allow
RA’s tp better communicate with students. To accomplish both of these things, I will work with

the Internal vice president, active minds, Society of Undergraduate Psychologists, and work
collectively with RHA. I will also make sure to work with other wellness and student needs
groups to ensure an optimal plan is made and accomplish this goal by the end of the next school
year. To allow students to receive proper accommodation, I will implement an absence and
attendance policy that will not penalize students. The absence policy entails of professors making
attendance optional and can use Iclickers to provide extra credit. Students work in different
environments and have different priorities especially when having to work to pay for school.
That is why I want to ensure students have all the options they need without being penalized. I
will work with fellow senators, academic senate, and internal affairs to ensure that our students
have all the options necessary.","I hope to work with as many organizations as possible to continue to create unity and
interconnectedness here at UCSB. I will work with Health and Wellness and Mental health peers
to receive feedback from staff as well as gather complaints and see how to realistically reduce
wait times and expand our mental health services. I will also work with R.H.A to negotiate and
create a mental health peer designated areas that will remain inside the dorms for other gauchos
to take advantage of. I will also work with Active Minds, Society of Undergraduate
Psychologists, Intersectional Feminists, and Health and Wellness club to gain a better
perspective of the needs of our student body. Other groups I will work with include our
LGBTQ++ center and the multicultural center to ensure that our students are represented, feel
safe in the dorms and have better time transitioning, and to continuously see from other
perspectives of the student body that I do not identify with since I am Latina. The reason why I
want to work with so many organizations is that I want my bills and resolutions to be equitable
and benefit all our students. I do understand it will be a challenge to work with so many
organizations but the challenges are worth fighting for and the benefits will extend to future
gauchos.","I will make myself available by setting my office hours and being as available as possible on my
social media platforms and through zoom. Using social media allows me to connect with others
easily because of the great options we have such as video chat, live, and being able to share
resources with various groups of people. I personally believe it is important to allow students to

know that regardless of the distance, their input still matters. They matter. To ensure that I make
my constituents know that I am available, I will send various reminders through my social
media platform and organize events not only to destress but to continue to strengthen my
relationship with the student body. I will also have polls, mental health posts, and updates about
our campus to ensure students are informed and they can voice their opinions or concerns. I want
our gauchos to know that senators are here to represent them not just the senators’ platforms and
amplify our students' voices so they will be heard.","I believe I am the best candidate because I am open and honest with others, look past individual
differences and like to work together with others, am extremely resilient, and want the best for
others.As a double major in Communication and Psychology and Brain Science and
first-generation student, my first year at UCSB was a year of learning and growth. My growth
was not limited to learning the importance of mental health, but the importance of receiving
support from others and having a growth mindset. I am a low-income and first-generation
student who comes from a predominantly Latinx community and did not feel like I fit in with the
middle-class students. I felt like I did not belong but with guidance from mentors, I eventually
learned to seek help from others and learned to develop a growth mindset in difficult
circumstances. My first year I learned so much and figured out who I am: a girl who loves
helping others, loves mental health, and wants to make UCSB a better place for future gauchos.
I am an individual who loves to learn and wants to better our community. I am fortunate to have
been able to work closely with C.A.P.S, have learned about the inequity in our mental health
resources, have learned about the academic senate policies, and am a Pearman Intern which has
allowed me to learn how to amplify voices of others and work together to implement bills and
resolutions. I am not perfect but I give individuals my all and want them to flourish. I believe
that helping others and working collectively rather than individually allows a group to be the
most productive and effective. As a candidate, I have experience with planning events, have
attended senate meetings, and I am motivated to tackle issues such as sexual assault and creating
long-lasting change that will benefit all gauchos. As a candidate who is left-leaning, I look at
issues through multiple perspectives and if it is an issue I have limited information on, I like to
gather with other people to discuss in a professional manner. I am also very considerate of other
students’ voices and will incorporate new ways of receiving student feedback to ensure current
and systemic issues are resolved effectively. Side note, I am very professional and typically
punctual with the exception of this assignment because of my grandmother who was in the
hospital and my uncle who has been in critical condition.",Left-leaning,"No answer. I believe the work of the 70th A.S. The Senate has done a great job. The Senate has been
increasing the representation as seen by the addition of the international chair and has
continuously been making an effort to meet the needs of the student body. This is evident in the
establishment of the Basic Needs Resource center, the creation of a center to support Students
Against Sexual Assault, the Mental Health Town Hall and module, a new Senate seat for
international students, and continuously updating students about ways to keep healthy in
emergencies. I feel that the A.S Senate has set an amazing example of what a healthy senate and
collectivism can do to positively impact our campus. Additionally, I believe that our next senate
can continue to work on the ideas of food insecurity, mental health, tuition, and work to
implement policies to reduce tuition. With food insecurity, I want to expand the food bank and
ensure everyone has a meal to eat. With mental health, the senate can continue to expand the
accessibility of the resources on campus and expand the mental health peers. I want to be a part
of a senate that will work on extended scholarships to out of state students and international
students because each hardworking individual should have the opportunity to have their school
paid for. Another issue to shine a light on includes academic-related policies that affect students
during times of personal emergency and have emergency preparedness policies that cover
earthquakes, landslides, fires, and other pandemic like situations. I believe that working together
and doing what is best for students can allow the A.S Senate to accomplish more than we have
this year. The next A.S senate will be prepared and productive if we focus on the best interest of
students and look past individual differences.","No. The topic of divestment is controversial and may be a more personal topic to our students of
Israeli descent and students who are from Israel. My knowledge of the issue is very limited but I
know the basics. With the information I have I cannot be in favor or against and believe that
fellow Gauchos like myself, need to be educated on a topic that may have misleading and
confusing information.","Yes, I believe UCSB should be tuition-free. The UC system was founded on the idea of free
tuition, creating an equitable education system. As a low-income and first-generation student,
education should not impose financial barriers to disadvantaged groups.Creating a tuition-free
UCSB will allow students to focus their attention on their education and become more involved.
Students would also have a healthier mental state since the financial burden can be stressful to
juggle as a student. Education is a right, and students have the right to achieve the goals they
have with hard work, a healthy state of mind, and perseverance.","I do not believe the mental health services at UCSB are adequate. Although there are a lot of
services available to students, I believe that many students who are facing severe mental illness
are being excluded due to the referrals of outside resources and the long lines at C.A.P.S. I do
believe that the accessibility of mental health services should be worked on so the resources can
be accessible to those that are suffering severe mental illness. I also have noticed that many
students need long-term therapy and are often sent to other providers that are I would start off
with increasing the mental health peers in the residence halls and providers that are twenty
minutes to an hour away. If long term mental health services are increased, the expansion can
reduce the wait time at C.A.P.S and the student can go to their therapist when they need to seek
help. I also want to continue to inform students of the resources on campus by making
informational videos that can be shown during orientation or the week of welcoming. Rather

than simply relying on pamphlets, a video can reinforce the differences within the various
services on campus. By also providing pamphlets, students can use the pamphlets as a reference
to the mental health resources on campus. Students learning the differences in the mental health
services on campus can allow students to have a variety of choices and see which choice is best.
The educational services videos about mental health would also be shown to faculty since most
of our faculty have a difficult time directing our students to the proper resources and can become
more knowledgeable.","I believe the university could have done better to handle the situation of sexual assault. Students
received vague information about the situations that occurred which I do understand is due to
respect for the victims. However, if it was okay by the victim, our fellow gauchos should know
where it took place and call out the fraternities. Everyone should be held accountable and not
addressing the fraternities does not give the victims justice and instead seems like the school is
trying to protect the perpetrator more than the victim. I do believe the Task Force and meeting
with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) were great starts. However, I believe there are more
effective ways of handling the situation. The University needs to respond promptly and listen to
the needs of those affected and if it is okay with the victims, release an email containing the
information of the location and name of the fraternity if involved. That allows gauchos to avoid
specific fraternities and stand in solidarity with victims. Additionally, there should be more than
implementing new alcohol regulations through the IFC and should suspend fraternities and/or
kick them out from the campus. Implementing a no-tolerance policy on campus allows students
to know their voices will be heard and will know that perpetrators will be given appropriate
consequences. I also believe that if there is a pattern in the gender of the perpetrators and their
organizations, there should be in-person training that will appropriately talk about sexual assault,
school policies on sexual assault, and will be the only warning given to students. believe proper
educational tools and explicit instructions of handling sexual assault such as addressing the
situation and informing students about where the sexual assault took place will reform the way of
handling such events.","I believe that Title IX is not a great system to address sexual assault
on UC campuses since there are issues with the system. The Daily Nexus shined a light on the

issues of sexual assault and how several sexual assault cases have been mishandled. The colleges
are aware that sexual assault cases have an impact on student enrollment and applications which
is a reason why many students’ justice is put at a cost for consumerism in the education system.
Due to the vast amount of cases, the implementation of the revised Title IX should provide
greater protection for students. Victims need to be treated with respect and must be listened to
and money used could never replace the damage victims feel. I believe that more revisions made
to Title IX which include more transparency can allow sexual assault to be treated with
importance and can allow the school to take action in a timely manner. Furthermore, to help
students receive guidance about sexual violence, I believe there should be continuous efforts to
help students receive the help they need especially with those with abusers on campus. I also
would suggest increasing the amount of peers designated to help victims of sexual assault in the
residence halls that can help with anonymous reporting and support.","I do not believe that UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups including
members of the Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+ community and others. Although there are
organizations for minority groups, minority groups as a whole are not represented as seen by the
lack of diversity with our educators and curriculum. I believe that eliminating the European
requirement and students take more than one minority class and educating students more about
the different communities on campus can be a great start. Another way to help underrepresented
students is to have peers assigned to students during the first year of college that can help with
the high dropout rates for first-generation students. Although there are Living Learning
Communities in university housing which include underrepresented groups and clubs, students of
underrepresented groups want representation and a community. Seeing the lack of inclusion with
faculty did not allow me to feel at home my first year and believe the more inclusion with
underrepresented groups we have on campus, the better our students will feel. Additionally, I
would like UCSB to work on becoming a more accepting school when it comes to international
students. I see how excluded international students feel due to the assumption that all Asian
students are Chinese when in actuality, there are Japanese, Taiwanese, and other groups in the
Asian community. It would be best to have modules at UCSB that better educate our students
about other communities on campus and allow UCSB to become more welcoming of others.","The first resolution I plan to author is one regarding the expansion of the food-bank. Students
should have a meal to eat each day and students should not have to starve themselves to save
money. Since I see so many students that are struggling with food insecurity, I will write a
resolution that will allocate funds to expand the food bank. Oftentimes students do not have time
to make their home-cooked meals due to other responsibilities and extracurriculars. The
resolution will provide the proper equipment to store and handle perishable food and to provide
free cooked meals that are healthy and accessible to all.","As senator, I would work to involve the student body more by informing my community of
students about the resolutions passed through social media and holding office hours. I will make
sure to have my office hours known and more accessible by talking to fellow RA’s and housing
and place flyers of associated students all over the dorms. Additionally, I will work closely with
A.S Creative Media to create pamphlets and help with social media posts to help students learn
about A.S. I want students to become more comfortable to approach fellow members and I will
give it my all to help as many students possible. I will also make A.S more approachable by
making a common area with students who are aware of A.S. related commissions to help lessen
confusion and table outside of different areas to inform students of associated students. Having a
more welcoming common area will allow more students to learn about our board members,
various commissions and become more open to becoming involved in student government. I
will also have weekly emails sent to students that will inform them of important legislation, A.S
recap of events and future events that will be happening, and will provide opportunities for
organization position and volunteer work.","The top priorities for the next UC President will be how to address tuition burdens, natural crises
specific to California, and will need to become aware of the importance of prioritizing students’
needs. The president should have specific procedures that would be followed by the UC’s and
would lessen the amount of confusion students have in times of havoc. The next UC president

also needs to be better at compromising with the COLA movement because our future educators
deserve better. Personally, I know how important and how impactful teachers assistants are to
our student body and it is very saddening to see the amount of money spent on enforcement
when the money could have been allocated to our TA’s stipend. Education needs to be prioritized
so all students alike can focus on their education rather than working several jobs to make ends
meet. I also believe the cost of tuition needs to be addressed and the next UC president should
work to reduce the costs of tuition to make college more affordable and accessible to all. All
students worked extremely hard to get admitted into the UC system and they should not be
bombarded with additional financial stress. The president needs to work collectively with others
to make the best decisions based on the student’s needs, not the amount of money that will be
lost. Lastly. The president should also devise a plan that will strictly enforce environmentally
friendly practices and avoid supporting companies that use fossil fuels and do not protect
indigenous land. Indigenous land should never be sacrificed for scientific research. The next UC
president should be more respectful of other cultures and their sacred land because here at UCSB
we are a community and the next UC president should think the same way.",,,,,,,
Gurleen Pabla,max,On Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gurleen-Pabla-On-Campus-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,,Political Science,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 71st senate because I know there is a lot of work
to be done. Joining Campus United has exposed me to so many people, including the
AS President Alison Sir, Internal Vice President Alli Adam, and so many more who do
everything they can to make UCSB the best it can be. Being someone who has no
experience in UCSB’s student government felt like a disadvantage at first, but I
quickly came to realize the outside perspective it gives me. As someone who spent this
year not only living on campus but also working within my residence hall, I gained a
lot of knowledge on how these halls are run as well as what we can do to provide for
students. Along with this, there are so many resources available to students that they
just are not aware of that I want to help bring into the light to support small
organizations as well as students in need. One of the most important things to me is
making sure students always feel represented; an effective government is one that
gives everyone within it a chance to voice themselves, even if that be through a
representative. I want to be a part of the positive change we see on this campus and I
want to represent our student body as well as I can.","Throughout my first year, I was very active in my residence hall’s Hall Council. We
met every week and discussed upcoming events, funding, and what we could do to
make our residence hall great for everyone. As a floor representative, I was able to
work alongside other floor reps and decide on necessary funding for different events.
One of the key aspects we would always look at is if the event is inclusive to as many
people as possible, and how we could make it more inclusive. Those conversations
really showed me how easy it is to make sure everyone feels like they can be involved
within their community, and that was evident even in the events my committee and I
held throughout the year. Along with this, I am involved in UCSB’s Army ROTC
program. This program has taught me so much about leadership and teamwork; having

to work with all kinds of people to solve problems and make sure everyone is involved
actively is crucial in making sure plans run as smoothly as possible. I believe these
skills translate directly into a senator position where I would likewise be having to
consider many people in every decision I make. Communication is vital between
leaders and the people they represent to ensure that everyone has a voice as we move
forward together and I believe that through these types of involvements, I have been
able to learn how to do just that.",NO ANSWER,"My platform, as I am running for On-Campus Senate, will be centered around the students that
are living in residence halls. The vast majority of these students are freshmen with little to no
knowledge about how campus life works and the resources available to them. In office, I would
be creating ways to keep as many students informed as possible about how our school works,
whether that be through mass emails, social media platforms, or even fliers around the school.
Along with this, I would also be working with some second year students living in residence
halls such as San Rafael and Manzanita Village, doing my best to ensure that these students feel
just as involved as anyone else. One of the greatest things I have learned during my short time
working with Campus United is just how many resources that our school has to offer. As a
freshman, I was never exposed to many of the committees and organizations dedicated to student
life at UCSB and I would do my best to spread that type of information to students. These groups
include but are not limited to mental health facilities and organizations dedicated to food supply
for students in need. In growing the amount of people these groups impact, I would also be sure
to keep in contact to make sure they are always funded properly and given enough to provide and
function efficiently.","One of the biggest focuses of my campaign is ensuring proper mental health care for all students.

Organizations such as UCSB’s Mental Health Taskforce have already done so much for our
students and I would continue our work with them as well as the Public and Mental Health
Commission to see that we are continuing to push for the best resources we can offer. I often talk
about how important it is to be as transparent with students as possible. We often feel like our
campus is so large that there is no way to keep track of what is going on, but I believe especially
in these confusing times that it is not only possible but crucial that we keep everyone informed
on the ways we are moving forward. This can be done in so many methods ranging from online
groups to apps like Wildfire, but I know I could work with UCSB’s Publications organization
and even the Media Center to continue pushing information about events as well as changes and
important news to all students. Of course, there are so many ways to relay this information
already, but students often end up lost between countless emails, websites, and posts. There are
multiple news sources such as the Daily Nexus that are dedicated to keeping students informed
about issues campus wide that they may be interested in, and these are resources that I want
students on campus to utilize to ensure that there is as much transparency throughout the student
body and administration as possible.","Although this shift into online courses has made connection very difficult, I believe that if we
understand how to work through it together, we can make the best of it. Social media platforms
and other methods of communication such as messaging apps have made it easier to stay
connected than ever before and I believe it is absolutely vital to continue utilizing this
technology moving forward, regardless of if we are in-person or online. That being said, because
this online transition has been so drastic for all students, I have noticed people coming together
through all platforms such as Instagram trends or Facebook groups, just proving that we are all in
this together somehow. If necessary, I would be completely open to online communication and I
would even encourage some sort of forum for students to contact their representatives directly so
there will always be that active communication that allows students to be as involved in their
student body as they can be. We can even open some type of dropbox where students with
concerns can drop in suggestions for representatives to consider. Ideas like “office hours” for
student body representatives can be driven the same way professors and TAs have been keeping
themselves open for certain times throughout the week via email or even Zoom calls. This allows
for those students to contact their representatives with concerns and questions in real time, and it
is crucial that we continue to push for voices in the student body to be heard.","I would be the best candidate for this position because I believe in the power of student voice.
Throughout high school, I was in many leadership positions such as president of multiple clubs
and even the track and field team captain for two years. In that time, I dealt with many situations
where the people who looked up to me as a leader were not motivated to move forward and from
those experiences, I learned how to push through hardships as a team. During my time here at
UCSB, I took it upon myself to be a floor representative for San Rafael’s hall council where I
represented the residents on my floor when discussing events and money spent in our residence
hall. This gave me some insight on how to properly represent a group of people, always making
sure to talk to some residents beforehand to get opinions on ideas as well as keeping everyone
updated through posters and Groupme messages about upcoming events. I have always felt that
transparency is crucial to get things done and properly represent people, and that is a value I will
continue to uphold when in office. One of the most important lessons that I carry with me to this
day is that everyone has such a unique perspective on the world that shapes the way they react to
problems, so you can never take someone’s ideas for granted. In that sense, I believe I have a
very open mind and I will always be willing to hear the suggestions and requests of my
colleagues as well as constituents when it comes to passing bills or making decisions.","Independent, I think it’s important to look at
individual policies and solutions rather than identifying blindly with any party outlook
on politics.",Very Good,"No: This topic is not one I know enough to
express a fully formed opinion about. I will always advocate for human rights, and I
definitely would love to see support from organizations such as our university in
efforts to relieve those in impoverished countries. However, without more personal
research on the topic, I think it is unfair of me to express any perspective, and I would
definitely be open to speaking more on this issue once it becomes one I am more
familiarized with.","No: Although it is essential to have some resources to help
students afford their education as well as enforcements to ensure that universities are not
scamming students and making education inaccessible to certain groups, there is countless staff
within our campus that deserve an adequate paycheck for their hard work. From T.A’s to
janitorial services, there are people in our system we cannot overlook. Along with this, there are
also vital resources that are provided to students that we can expand through AS efforts and

committee resolutions that would only go to further benefit students which would not exist
without tuition costs.","As an incoming freshman, I remember being constantly preached to about the impressive
extent to the mental health services provided at UCSB. However even as a freshman, there
have been instances where I have felt the need to take advantage of these so-called resources
where I was given a wait time estimated by the months. My experience is not surprising to
many students, I have talked with countless people (including but not limited to my own
friends) who have dealt with this same struggle of needing the resources that were presented
as far more functioning than they really are. Just the idea that there are two months worth of
students that are desperately seeking mental health services at any given time on our campus
should not sit well with anyone. One of the problems seems to be that students just do not
know all of the programs available for them. UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force continues
working directly to bridge the gap between mental health resources and the student body,
including a new website that helps students navigate support systems that are available to
them in a way that makes it easier to get the help they need. We need more coverage on these
systems to reach more students who may need the help but are unable to find it because it
otherwise results in an overflow of people to one program that may not even have what they
are seeking. While I see on-campus resources such as mental health events coordinated in
residence halls, these events do not reach out to the vast majority of university students who
need more than a face mask and a movie night. It is vital that we continue to show how many
students care about each other as well as themselves in the area of mental health, and we
must continue to emphasize that mental health is just as important as physical health. As an
AS Senator, I would work closely with groups like UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force to
ensure that we continue to improve the services we can provide to all students.","In a situation like that, it is obviously going to be hard for the university to go through all
evidence and processes necessary while making sure the students feel like there is any effort
being made. I am a strong advocate for constant transparency and there is no reason that we
should not be kept in the loop in a situation that could be dangerous as well as concerning for
many if not all students. There is only so much we can do to stop individual actions, but
seeing sexual assault become such a pattern on university campuses is alarming and cannot
go unaddressed. I have had to take the same online courses given to all students regarding
sexual assault and I have seen the ways to be an active bystander, but all these “solutions” do
is teach how to stop the crime in action. I do not believe these methods are preventative
enough and I think there is so much more we can do than wait until it is too late. I would like
to advocate and continue to support the work that the UCSB Safer Social Events Task Force
has done because we need more emphasis on reformative methods that change the way we
stop sexual assault on our campus.","I believe that Title IX is not a great system to address sexual assault
on UC campuses since there are issues with the system. The Daily Nexus shined a light on the

issues of sexual assault and how several sexual assault cases have been mishandled. The colleges

importance and can allow the school to take action in a timely manner. Furthermore, to help
students receive guidance about sexual violence, I believe there should be continuous efforts to
help students receive the help they need especially with those with abusers on campus. I also
would suggest increasing the amount of peers designated to help victims of sexual assault in the
residence halls that can help with anonymous reporting and support.","As lucky as I have been to attend such a richly diverse and accepting campus, I believe
there is always work to be done when it comes to representation. Every week I am sent

emails and I look around campus to see flyers about events that not only serve to
represent different groups, but also many that involve interests and hobbies that bring
people of all different groups together. From my own experience, the best organizations
are the ones that are not the “most accepting,” but the ones that look towards the
character of a person rather than focusing on their born traits. While it is vital that we
continue to represent all groups and ensure diversity is never overlooked, it is also
important that we do not stop there and we continue to support organizations that are
inclusive to interests and the development of relationships that dive deeper than the
surface to build a more connected campus.","I will never stop advocating for the improvement if not reformation of our school’s mental
health care facilities. UCSB takes student’s mental health very much into account; I have
seen residence halls, professors, and even the chancellor address topics involving students’
mental health in the past. However, it is a different story talking to everyday students. I
have spoken with many people, including both friends and strangers throughout campus,
to see what common opinions are surrounding UCSB’s mental health services and the
answers are almost always the same; inadequate. Of course, this campus is known and
often brags about its advanced resources, but students do not feel they have proper access
to mental health care, regardless of how educated they are on the amount of resources we
have to provide. I firmly believe that mental health is just as important as physical health
and it is concerning to me that in a university where students are constantly under severe
pressure and stress, they feel that they are not given adequate access to basic healthcare.
We must approach a reformative bill that looks at mental health with that exact
perspective-- that it is just as important as physical well-being. I think if we were to invest
more attention and funds into our existing programs, it is completely possible to expand
them and to ensure that more students are cared for as efficiently as possible. Luckily,
through my short time with Campus United, I have already had multiple personal
conversations with leaders who are dedicated to this same issue. Even our current AS
President, Alison Sir, has done so much including organizing a Mental Health Town Hall
to initiate a broader conversation about how we work through mental health issues as a
community. These are the types of efforts I would continue to support and help grow in
office.","Social media has become such an amazing outlet of relaying information to students.
However, just as well as it is a resource, it can also be seen as a threat to our ability to
decipher between true and false information. There are countless forums such as
Facebook where a great majority of students can join groups that share information
that may be important for others to know. I am a part of many of these groups,
including the Wildfire app that gives students the run-down on events that concern
them in real time. It is crucial that we continue using these forums because students
do not have the time to sit around and try to figure out what is going on and how it
will affect them. In recent events, Chancellor Yang constantly sent emails regarding
how to move forward and the effects of the recent virus on student life and classes in
the future. This consistent transparency not only keeps students in the loop, it lets
them know that their school cares about them and the quality of their education. It is
important that we keep all students informed about how things around campus are
working and what resources they have/what may affect them in the future, and I
would push for more of this to be done through social media so students have
constant access to that information in their hands.","I think one of the biggest concerns students have is transparency with how their tuition is
being used to make their campus as efficient and beneficial as it can be. We always see a
new building being built on campus or some form of construction that will not affect most
students’ day-to-day lives. Truth be told, these projects serve the university more than they
do the students. Everyone attending UCSB can name at least one area in which we can
improve, a very large one being fixing the bike paths. This suggests that there is a lot we can
do in developing resources that students can directly see helping them. Along with this, we
prioritize our sustainability efforts greatly, but there is so much more work to be done. The
next UC President definitely needs to continue the efforts to make the UCs as climate
friendly as possible as we aim to be a zero emission campus. These ideas all seem to tie in
together; it is crucial that students understand where their tuition is going and how it is
helping them as they pursue higher education so they can continue to work with AS leaders
and their own committees in advocating for causes and funds that they feel are important.
The next UC President should continue to work directly with students across UC campuses

to hear their concerns and help fund and support their efforts to find resolutions. We need a
president who is as eager to make positive change the same way I see students across
campuses working to see progress.",,,,,,,

love the people and atmosphere at UCSB and know that I can make the experience for future
students even better. As the Director of Legislative Accountability this year, I have connected
BCUs to their assigned Senators, handled any miscommunications or complaints about the
assignments, created a more modern and organized accountability system for both BCUs and
Senators by moving it from paper to digital, and I sat on the TPS/ratepayers board as the liaison
from the office of the IVP.  From early on I was drawn to student leadership and aside from my
role in AS, I’m on the Executive Boards of both Chabad and SSI. Even outside of my official
leadership positions, I have taken the initiative to lobby AS members and administrators alike to
advocate for the needs of the communities I am a part of. I was one of the main student voices
that supported the current Kosher/Halal food program and I continue to push for a more
permanent and steady solution with the creation of an entirely Kosher/Halal dining hall.",See above.,"The first bill I would introduce is a bill that would use the excess fees from students that AS
doesn’t use to reduce the overall cost of school through either a partial refund of whatever
wasn’t used, setting up a fund to be used for need based financial aid, or using the money to
subsidize cheaper textbooks. I would work with Finance and Business along with multiple facets
of the administration to make this a sustainable reality so that students get more from the
hundreds of dollars they pay to AS each year. The second would be a resolution calling for
better academic accommodations for religious students. There is no school policy about
religious accommodations other than the obligation to move a final. Whether it’s midterms,
quizzes homeworks or even attendance, the decision is up to the professor and that means that
religious students will never know if they can rely on accommodations or not. This resolution will
show religious students that someone is in their corner and I will work with the administration,
Hillel, MSA and various other religious orgs to make the demands of this resolution a reality.
The third thing I would pass would be a bill to allocate funding for the implementation of the
Blue-Light system and put together a task force to get it done. I will work with administration,
IVTU, IVCSD and the EVPLA to put together this task force and get the job done. It has been
way too long since the implementation of the first Blue-Lights on campus and I think it is about
time IV started feeling safer at night.","The most important parts of my platform and how I plan to achieve them are detailed above.
I also plan to work with the SRB, Library and UCEN to implement more AS charging stations so
that when midterms or finals come around, these spaces are more capable of dealing with the
increase in students spending a lot of time there. My final platform is to work with IVTU, IVCSD
and the EVPLA to get more street lighting in Isla Vista and build on the work that has already
been started in years passed.","I have detailed above who I will be working with for each part of my platform and will be open
to working with and hearing from any org or entity not already listed. I am here to give a voice to
my constituents and am happy to work with any org or entity that helps me do that.","I will hold weekly zoom office hours that will be posted on my Senate Facebook page and will
be open to making appointments outside of those office hours. I will also be available through
email, facebook messenger or whatever platform of communication works best with the student.
I plan to check all these forms of communication by the end of each day and respond to them as
soon as i read them or as soon as I have an answer. If for whatever reason a student cannot
find a time to actually meet with me, I will create a google form that will be posted on my Senate
Facebook page with a comments box that I will use to get feedback from students and still have
a way to listen to what they need to talk to me about. All of my personal social media account
information will also be made available along with my phone number, I understand the
importance of being available to my constituents and am prepared to go the extra mile to do so.","After spending a year in AS I have a clear idea of what is going well and what needs
improvement. I have specific ideas and plans on how to go about making these changes. I am
very excited to work with other senators who want to make change like I do and look forward to
working with Senators with different opinions to find a middleground where everyone benefits. I
have experience directly consulting Legal Code at the request of the IVP and I’m familiar with
the procedures of Senate meetings so I can hit the ground running once I get elected and start
getting things done immediately. I have experience working with AS entities and the
administration and have made vital connections with those people that will help me achieve my
goals. I am very open to new ideas and will advocate for any student who comes to me with a
voice that needs to be heard. I care about our campus and will do everything in my power to
make it better.","Centrist, I have some opinions that are to the left and some to the right but they average out
in the middle.","Very Good, as the Director of Legislative Accountability, I have had the unique opportunity to
watch senators work and I witnessed a group that is overall very dedicated to the student body
and who really care about the important issues.","Divestment is connected to an extremely controversial issue with valid claims on both sides.
I personally am against Divestment and am pro-Israel. I would like to clarify however, that this
does not mean I don’t recognize the struggle of the palestinian people. I believe that the true
path to a peaceful resolution of the conflict is by building bridges between the communities not
by building walls, whether they be physical or financial. I don’t approve of most of the things the
Israeli government does or has done in the past, but one could say that about many countries
and yet I don’t see a reason to divest from companies that do business with those countries. As
a proud member of the Jewish community I believe that the Divestment resolution is
Anti-Semitic and the only proof needed for that is the majority of the Jewish community agreeing
that it is.","Yes, I believe that all higher education should be free but I would say that the best way to
get there is gradually with a good plan that doesn't leave teachers underpaid and resources and
facilities underfunded. UCSB was founded with the idea it would be free. I think that that is the
right way to go but just cutting tuition immediately presents too many problems. The best path in
my opinion is to gradually lower tuition over a period of time to allow the necessary adjustments
to be made.","From my personal experience, I think that the types of services available are adequate but
they do not have enough locations. Students should be able to easily fit a visit to CAPS into
their schedules, and if they spend most of their time around the Chem Building or Physical
Sciences, that can be quite difficult. The staff I have encountered at CAPS have always been
respectful, understanding and helpful. When I am elected, if any of my constituents expressed a
desire to fix the Mental Health system or make it better, I would not hesitate to do everything in
my power to do so. Mental Health is just as, if not more important than Physical Health,
especially to a student. It is the responsibility of any university to give their students the best
chance to succeed and that goes hand in hand with making sure all of their students can access
whatever resources are necessary to stay healthy, mentally and physically. For example, the
University could partner with Acacia to build a system where students who can’t get a CAPS
counselor, are helped without having to do any extra work.","The university did not handle the situation with the fraternities well at all. Sexual Harrasment
and Sexual Assault are not matters that should be taken lightly. After the allegations made in
Fall Quarter, I would expect those Frats to be kicked off of campus. Simply putting Frats on
social probation for the remainder of a quarter that was already almost over is not nearly
enough. Frats have to take real responsibility for what happened. I think they should have been
required to have some sort of real education on what sexual harassment or assault are and how
to actively prevent them. When the school fails to respond properly to something like this, it
sends a message to the student body that the school doesn’t care. This message is not only a
sad one but an unacceptable one. If the school required Green Dot training for all OSL groups
including Greek Life, I think it would be a good indicator that the administration cares and is
working to create a safer environment.","I think that Title IX is not strict enough on universities. Just mandating a system of report is
nice, but not enough. Schools should be forced to put policies in place that are in line with the
legal repercussions of sexual harrassment or sexual assault. The university should not be given
the opportunity to kick the can down the road and hope someone else does the job. People
need to be helped as soon as these things happen and not at the leisure of some bureaucracy.
For too long the voices of people who have been harassed or assaulted have been silenced for
no better reason than “They were asking for it dressed like that” or “they should have manned
up and said no”. We can no longer allow this bigotry to exist and when I am elected senator, I
will fight to eliminate it.","As someone from a religious background, I can say that while UCSB has some great
resources for underrepresented groups, it definitely could use some more work. For the
Religious Community specifically, there are very few ways that the University accommodates
our holidays and traditions. I once was forced to drop a class I needed for my major just
because the department refused to give me the accommodations I needed to have an equal
playing field with the rest of the class. When I asked the department head why they refused to
accomodate me they said that there was actually no policy that pertained to my situation and
that it was above their power to do anything about. In the end it took too long to set up a
meeting with the person who could have helped me and I was forced to request a late drop to
avoid the low grade I would have gotten from missing the first three weeks of the quarter. When
I am elected one of my first orders of business will be to set this right and work with the
administration to create real and sensible policies that take into account the needs of religious
students, and any other underrepresented groups who have to work harder to keep up just
because of their background.","The first bill I plan to author is a bill that will put money back in the hands of students. For
years AS entities have been given budgets that are larger than what they actually spend, and
the extra just goes into a rollover budget that they can use next year. All that does however, is
create even more extra money sitting around doing nothing. I plan to change that. I will write a
bill that puts any excess funds at the end of the year back in the hands of students. This would
lower the overall cost of student fees by way of reimbursement. This money could also be used
to lower the price of textbooks or create a scholarship program for students in financial need.
AS gets around 14 million dollars a year to work with, if even 5 percent of that were to be given
back to students  it would free up $700,000 to give back to students. Imagine a UCSB where
that 600 dollars a year you pay actually saves you 600 dollars in textbooks, that's the UCSB I
want to create.","When I was a freshman I wanted to get involved in student government but I couldn’t even
find the name Associated Students, let alone the room it was in. The Pearman fellowship is a
great way to get involved with Associated Students and the number of fellows it yielded was
much higher this past year than years past, but I think it can get much bigger and more
accessible. When I am elected, I will work with the Office of Admissions and the Creative Media
Unit to get the word out to students before they even start their first quarter at UCSB. As the
Director of Legislative Accountability, I know first hand what it’s like to try and keep the Senate
accountable. In my position in AS I have already created a digital system of accountability to
replace the extremely out of date one which was still on paper. When I am a Senator I will write
legislation to get updates on the  senate agenda, senate office hours, senate meeting times and
other information posted not just on the senate website, but on the Daily Nexus and Bottom Line
as well.","With the recent events of the COLA strike, it became clear to me that President Napolitano
did not place enough emphasis on the needs of Grad Students and TAs. My number one priority
from the next President would be an administrator who will fight for the needs of their undergrad
and grad students, their faculty and their staff. Many of us have been through the hell that is
going to advising from three different departments and somehow having 7 different answers to a
simple question. I want a President who will work towards a more cohesive campus. Our UC
President should work towards sensible policy that makes living as a UCSB student easier, not
more confusing. When students gather together to ask for something that is quite basic, the UC
President should listen to what they have to say and work towards a real compromise if they
don’t have the means to fully grant these requests. The UC President is supposed to be the
embodiment of the voices of students, faculty and staff, I want the next one to fit that
description.",,"I am running for senate because I have a passion for changing my community for the better. I
love the people and atmosphere at UCSB and know that I can make the experience for future
students even better. As the Director of Legislative Accountability this year, I have connected
BCUs to their assigned Senators, handled any miscommunications or complaints about the
assignments, created a more modern and organized accountability system for both BCUs and
Senators by moving it from paper to digital, and I sat on the TPS/ratepayers board as the liaison
from the office of the IVP.  From early on I was drawn to student leadership and aside from my
role in AS, I’m on the Executive Boards of both Chabad and SSI. Even outside of my official
leadership positions, I have taken the initiative to lobby AS members and administrators alike to
advocate for the needs of the communities I am a part of. I was one of the main student voices
that supported the current Kosher/Halal food program and I continue to push for a more
permanent and steady solution with the creation of an entirely Kosher/Halal dining hall.",,,,,
Yuval Cohen,max,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yuval-Cohen-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,2nd,Political Science/Middle East Studies,,,"I became involved with Associated Students my freshman year of college and I absolutely fell in
love with it. The community and people that make up AS all share a similar passion for UCSB
and want to see it become the best it can be. During my short time at UCSB, I have been able to
use my passion to enact change throughout my communities. By serving on the senate, I hope to
accomplish so much more. I am running because I want to be a voice for my community, I want
to represent the students, and I want to create an environment that everyone wants to be a part of.
I believe that senate is the perfect platform and place to come together and collaborate on ideas
that can truly make a difference, and that is something that I want to be involved in.","I have been involved in the AS Office of the President for two years now. My
freshman year, I was a fellow, and this year I am currently the Director of Dream
Scholar Affairs. As a fellow, I got to learn more about AS as a whole and all of the
moving parts that make it successful at UCSB. By my second year, I knew I wanted to
continue my work in the Office of the President. I had watched the individual who had
my previous position do a phenomenal job, and I wanted to bring my ideas to the
table. Being an undocumented student, I am very connected to my position as Director
of Dream Scholar Affairs. It has allowed me to make connections throughout my
community and raise awareness about undocumented students. I have seen things that
need to change, and I know what path they must take. This experience specifically has
prepared me to be a senator because I know how AS functions and what I can do as a
senator to make an impact.","The first resolution I would like to introduce revolves around helping undocumented
students. In June, the Supreme Court is expected to release their decision on whether
or not DACA will continue. This decision is going to impact a great number of
students, including myself. I know that before I became the Director of Dream Scholar
Affairs, I was totally unsure about the resources we have at UCSB for undocumented
students. I want to create a bill that works to advertise these resources and raise
awareness throughout the entire school about undocumented students. We need more
forums, events, and information for students, documented and undocumented. A
second resolution I would like to introduce is to partner with the Isla Vista Compost
Collective and increase the amount of compost bins throughout Isla Vista.
Sustainability is very important to me, and IVCC does a great job of composting. My
house is filled with compost bins, in Isla Vista and at my family’s home. Since IVCC
just partnered with the Isla Vista Community Services District so that they can have
more resources, this year would be a perfect time to increase access to compost bins
throughout Isla Vista. Restaurants, homes, lecture halls, and more places in Isla Vista
should have available composting bins. A third resolution I would like to introduce
while in office is to collaborate with the Recreation Center and possibly IVFP, UCPD,
and CFOs to create access to self defense classes. This school year, the community
definitely felt a lack of safety and security. I believe that all students should have the
option to learn how to defend themselves from any situation. No one should ever be in
a position where they feel vulnerable. Self defense classes are a perfect way to gain
that sense of extra security.","My platform revolves around the students and meeting their needs based on what I
have seen at UCSB for the past two years. Through my connections, I have gained a
good sense in realizing the things that need to change. My goals while in office will be
to revolve my actions around the students. There are so many voices and opinions that
never get heard, and my platform hopes to reach all of those students who want to see
change but do not know how to do something about it. I am very passionate about each
of my platform statements because I have a connection to each point. My biggest goal
would have to be increasing transparency and communication. I have always been a
very open and honest individual, so I hope to reflect that on my position as a senator as
well.","I hope to work with Undocumented Student Services (USS), the Mental Health Task
Force, Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), Environmental Affairs Board, AS
Office of the President, AS Food Bank, Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), and many
more. These are the main organizations and entities that I would love to collaborate
with. I believe in their mission and I want to do everything I can to help them
accomplish what they wish. I love coming together with different, yet like-minded
individuals because I know that it can result in something great.","I plan on hosting “online office hours,” like a lot of professors and TAs are currently
doing. I will be on Zoom at certain times or people can schedule a time that works for
them to meet with me. I want to be as available as possible, so I will be very active on
social media and platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, etc. I want constituents to
have full access to me and know that they should never hesitate to reach out. I believe
that by staying involved online and on commonly frequented pages or apps, I can
make it aware to students that I want to and will work to meet their needs.","When I was growing up, it was always hard for me to know what I wanted to be. All
the kids my age would have their dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers. But I was
all over the place, and I would simply base my future on what Netflix show I was
addicted to at the moment. When I began applying to colleges, I still did not know
what I wanted to do. I had to reflect on my entire life. That was when I realized that
everything I had done up to that point screamed leadership. I was in student
government all 4 years of high school and I would even go to Sacramento and lobby
every year. These were always things I loved doing, and I never thought I could ever
turn it into a career or something more. Senior year, I promised myself I would
become involved in student government again wherever I ended up. All of freshman
year, I joined everything that sounded remotely interesting to me, which is how I fell
in love with AS. UCSB took my love of community, leading, and government and
showed me that there was so much more I could bring to the table. My experience and
passion has been building up to this, and I know that I would do an amazing job as a
senator. As someone who has always had to work a little bit harder to prove myself, I
know that I can advocate for students and make the changes that they wish to see
within their university and community. I am overall super excited for this entire
journey no matter what happens.",Left-leaning,"Very Good. I believe that the work of the 70th Senate has been very sufficient. They have accomplished
a lot, my personal favorite being the creation of a new Senate seat for international students.
But as always, more work can be done to meet the needs of students.","No. This is a very controversial topic, especially since UCSB is the only UC that has not
voted in favor of this resolution. There is a great lack of knowledge circling this topic
and I believe that we must educate students on what the results of favoring BDS
would look like. Although I would not vote in favor of it, I will be open and impartial
to all other views and I am always eager to learn more.","No. UCSB should not be tuition-free at this time because
of all the resources and academics on campus that
must be funded. But, I do believe in lowering student
fees and making college more affordable to all through
continued lobbying efforts to fund the UC.","I believe that UCSB has a lot of services available to students. As a member of the AS Office
of the President, I was involved in coordinating the Mental Health Town Hall. During the
town hall, I learned a lot more about available resources on campus, CAPS being the main
one. A big issue with CAPS is the long wait times. There are a lot of instances where
students cannot wait for an appointment. I think by advertising the other resources, such as
peer groups or the emergency call-line, students can be educated on other options they may
have. Overall, CAPS can definitely improve their efficiency, but there are more services
available at UCSB besides CAPS that should be publicized and utilized more.","I believe that the university could have handled the situation better in the beginning. They
were slow to provide resources and help to students in need or those questioning everything
that was happening. Students really needed more information, yet they did not receive
enough information from the university reports. I believe the current exec board did a great
job of providing outlets to address the sexual assault instances, such as creating the UCSB
Safer Social Event Task Force. As time passed, the situation was addressed better, but the
initial response could have been better.","I believe that Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses.
But, there are things we can do to improve the system. The expansion of programs to help
fight sexual assault and providing more resources to survivors should be available. As a
Senator, I will work towards this by meeting the needs of my constituents.","The university itself should focus on hearing the voices of these communities and
meeting their needs. The student-led Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+, and other programs
should receive extra funding and help with expansion. These communities are doing a
great job with events and promoting awareness on campus. Overall, UCSB is making
great improvement in providing resources and practicing inclusion.","My first resolution that I plan to author if I am elected to serve on the Senate is a bill to
continue and expand the Mental Health Town Hall. This past school year, the Mental
Health Town Hall was run by the Office of the President. I believe if the Senate backs and
funds this event, it can grow and reach even more people. This town hall was very
beneficial for me and answered a lot of my questions surrounding mental health,
especially at UCSB. More students should be attending this town hall because everyone
should be educated about mental health. I think that this bill will greatly benefit and help
students.","I believe that with all of the resources we have, we should be advertising them to
students more. Through social media influence, email, and on-campus
advertisements, students can become more informed.  I also think that the student
body should stay informed through programs like GOLD and GauchoSpace. Students
regularly check these systems, and if there are updates from Associated Students on
these sites as soon as students log in, I think that could have a great influence on
UCSB’s campus.","Being UC President is a very important role that should be filled by a qualified and
experienced individual. I think the top priorities for the next UC President should be about
maintaining strong and adequate health services on each campus. Considering what is
currently going on in our world with the corona virus outbreak, health should be the number
one priority. At a campus like UCSB for example, our student health center should have
easier access. More important topics include lowering tuition, providing enough resources
for undocumented students following the upcoming announcement of the Supreme Court
decision on DACA, and sustainability on each campus (composting centers, reducing waste,
etc.).",,,,,,,
Catherine Flaherty,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Catherine-Flaherty-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,she/her/hers,2nd,Political Science,,,I am running because I am committed to representing the students of UC Santa Barbara in the Senate and ensuring a transparent and inclusive environment. I want to make the work of Senators more accessible to the everyday student so that they are confident in knowing their needs are working to be met.,"My work in the AS Office of the President as both the Executive Assistant and Director of Alumni Relations has prepared me for work as a senator. Through those positions, I was able to see the inner workings of Associated Students and learn about the various student groups and organizations integral to our campus. Through my work in Campus United and in viewing Senate meetings, I have been able to see the work of past and current senators and reflect on what I believe they are accomplishing and what they could improve upon.","I plan on introducing a resolution to continue support for the Mental Health Town Halls, founded by the Office of the President Alison Sir. Students and community members need spaces where they can express what our services are providing and falling short of. Additionally, many students simply aren’t aware of the vast amount of resources that we have, and I think that different organizations should be highlighted. I also plan on working on a bill to ensure there are adequate emergency funds in place for every need and a “guidebook” on where to access vital resources in times of great need and turmoil. Additionally, I plan on working with the IVPD to host Town Halls in order to improve relations with our local law enforcement.","Within Isla Vista, I plan on partnering with the IV Tenants Union to promote their Rate my Landlord system to ensure renting experiences are transparent, hosting Town Halls with the IVPD to improve relations between our students and our police, reinventing the Pardall Center to be a hub for students where they can access critical resources and promote local events to increase community, and working with CSOs to make sure that students feel safe both on and off campus. Regarding campus resources, I plan on improving emergency responses and learning from the Cave Fires and Covid-19 pandemic to create a central guide where students can access resources to alleviate housing, food, educational, and health insecurities, supporting survivors of sexual assault through confidendial resources and educating the community through prevention and awareness, continuing the Mental Health Town Halls to strengthen resources and eduacation, and lowering textbook prices and encourage professors to go online so that materials are accessible for all.","I plan on working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union, CAPS, the Book Bank, Commission on Student Well Being, Food Bank, Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), Gaucho Books, Human Rights Board, IV Community Relations Committee, Legal Resources Center, Public and Mental Health Commission, and Public Safety Commission.","I plan on hosting virtual office hours, where I am available on my computer to directly answer emails, phone calls, Zoom calls, etc. I also plan on being heavily active on my Facebook page so that my constituents are informed on what I am working on. Through posting the agenda, maintaining my social media, I hope to provide the transparency and connection needed to succeed in this role and ensure that I am representing my constituency to the best of my abilities.","My involvement in the Associated Students Office of the President has made me familiar with many of the organizations on campus, as well as the needs of many students. I am determined to use the knowledge that I have gained to provide solutions, through collaborating with senators from all parties, to my constituents’ concerns.",Left-leaning,"Very Good. They have done a great job, under the leadership of Internal Vice President Alli Adam, in keeping the goal of serving students in mind and ensuring professionalism in every aspect of Senate. I have especially supported the international seat bill and the resolution to support COLA authored by Tianna White and Olivia Campos. Something that can be improved, however, is increasing awareness of the work that Senate does. If elected, I hope to increase visibility for the general student population and make it more accessible for the
average student.","It would be a disservice to project my own opinions on the topic without consulting my constituents first. Until I hear from students at UCSB on all sides of the debate, I cannot vote with confidence and represent them to the best of my abilities.","I firmly believe that students from extremely low-income backgrounds should not have to bear the costof tuition. While in the foreseeable future free tuition is not feasible for every student, we need to focus onincreasing financial aid wherever possible. Tuition is necessary to support the resources used by students, butwherever the cost can be alleviated, it should. Perhaps more practical is analyzing alternative ways to allocatefunds so that it is the most effective for all.","While we are heading in the right direction, I believe that there is a lot of work to be done surrounding mental health on this campus. This past year I have served in the office of the AS President, Alison Sir, and have had the opportunity to learn about and support the many projects our office holds. Sejal Anuraji, ASOP’s Mental Health Coordinator, developed UCSB’s first Mental Health Town Hall - an event that I plan on
supporting through the Senate next year, if given the chance. I was one of a handful of students who attended the pre-session, which was critical in developing the content of the Town Hall. There I spoke with the leading administration in CARE, CAPS, ADP, Health and Wellness. It was evident that they wanted to help and recognize that there is a higher standard that they need to reach, but the funding just isn’t there. Through education, lobbying, students have the ability to demand institutional change. We have the power to put pressure, because there is only so much the administration can do other than work with what they are given.","I do believe that the university could have handled the situation better. I attended the public forums held in November and found the dialogue held between the administration and students to be long overdue and incredibly necessary in proceeding forward. In my opinion, the university should have been sending out more emails to keep students updated so that speculation could be either confirmed or denied. Additionally, of a handful of the emails sent out, the wording came across for many students as victim-blaming and unproductive. The university needs to stand firmly with survivors, and through these conversations I saw that they were open to feedback and genuinely committed to creating a safer space for all students. Additionally, in regards to the public forums, live streaming could have helped streamline information so that students who were working or in class had access to the same information and were able to see the administration’s responses to important questions.","I believe that Title IX is an adequate foundation in combatting sexual assault on UC campuses, but it falls short in supporting safety in our Isla Vista community where the majority of sexual assaults occur. Title IX rules apply to university-owned buildings and spaces, but many students do not live in these buildings after their first year. The University must protect and advocate for all students who are survivors - regardless of whether or not an assault happened on campus or off. ","I believe that UCSB does a good job at raising awareness for many historically underrepresented groups, but that there is progress still to be made. The awareness for every group is not there. groups, but that there is progress still to be made. The awareness for every group is not there. The university funds should be equitably allocated towards supporting these groups so that their outreach is the most effective, they have resources to tend to issues specific to their community, and each student’s voice is heard, respected, and acted on.","If I am elected to serve in the Senate, the first bill or resolution I plan to author is to set up emergency funds for pandemics or emergencies. Especially through the fires and now the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for an emergency fund is glaringly obvious. In addition to emergency funds, I want to create a central guide for emergencies where students can find the questions to their answers regarding housing, food, technology, and more. This will be widely distributed to ensure that it reaches every student when events like this occur, with information such as how to gain access to the emergency funds.","Associated Students is such a large organization with so many facets, and the work of all groups needs to be advertised more. In terms of the Senate, I have found it helpful that the sessions are live streamed and posted on Facebook. Although not everyone has a Facebook, this is a great start in ensuring transparency and accountability. Expanding the reach of these livestreams, as well as accompanying it with a brief summary of what bills or resolutions passed/did not pass, would be incredibly helpful. Through student media, GOLD, and Gauchospace, I believe this can be accomplished.","Continuing on from the issues raised this past quarter, I believe that her replacement must address COLA and the needs of graduate students. Protests on UC campuses garnered national media attention, and because graduate students are the backbone of our institution, they need to know that they are supported. Additionally, the UCs could work on coordinated responses to natural disasters or emergencies, such as the fires or COVID-19. Finally, mental health is an increasingly important topic on college campuses. Expanding services and improving wait times should be a priority in order to ensure all students' health and safety.",,,,,,,
Nathan Le,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nathan-Le-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,he/him/his,2nd ,Mathematics,,,"I am running to be an Off-Campus senator, because I believe I can serve as a liaison for the underrepresented groups of which I identify with: the Asian American, First-Generation, Low-Income, and LGBTQ+ communities. As someone who identifies with these communities, I recognize that I am just one voice of many different perspectives. Although I have my own agenda as to implement tangible change for our community, my desires may not encapsulate the entirety of the ideas that these communities feel most prominently for. Above all else, I want to bring forth and highlight the ideas and concerns that may be unheard.

Especially living within Isla Vista, which holds a massive population of the UCSB campus within two square miles, I believe that many concerns and issues are overlooked. I recognize that all groups have their individualized set of problems. Over the course of my time being here at UCSB, I’ve been exposed to so many pressing issues that require resolution. I am awed by the advocacy that my fellow peers have shown me, and through this, I’ve been inspired to take a stand against things that need change. All of us have the common goal of wanting UCSB to improve itself, and I believe that I can effectively do so. ","I currently hold a leadership position within my fraternity, and I’ve been able to really recognize the intricacies that go behind any organization that is on a college campus. There are so many different personalities, personal issues, and situations that one must be considerate of. With my experience of holding these leadership positions, such as philanthropy chairman and secretary, I recognize how important it is to understand how crucial it is to have participation from all to make a goal work. One must be mindful as to not negatively affect a certain group. Also, by working as a Supervisor at The Arbor, I’ve been prepared in refining my leadership skills. There are many moving parts that come with an organization that all work together with different positions to create fluidity. The Arbor has over 80 employees with associates, superivors, and managers all working together as one to make sure the store runs smoothly. In a sense, A.S. is the same. Many different positions work simultaneously together in order to work towards a common goal. Another way that I have been prepared, is that  I am also prepared to represent many different opinions and backgrounds. UCSB is an amazingly diverse school with the campus not being afraid to voice it’s opinion. I identify with many underrepresented groups whose opinions and thoughts should be heard. ","One of the main bills that I would like to introduce while in office is the creation of a donation center where students can donate food and school supplies and other necessities to. Living in Isla Vista, one of the largest issues that I have noticed is the abundance of food waste. A lot of food is thrown away simply because they will not be eaten by the person, rather than it going bad. With the creation of a donation center that accepts a variety of items such as food and school supplies, we can help minimize the food wastage as well as combating the pressing issue of food insecurity that looms over college students. School supplies are another thing that students will be able to donate. As a student myself, I found myself having extra blue books, pencils, scantrons, and notebooks that I ended up never using. By allowing other students to donate these items, it will allow for students who may be struggling financially to have one less thing to worry about. One of the main organizations that I will want to work with is the Pardall Center within IV and the Food Bank on Campus. I will work with the offices and resources necessary to make this possible, because this is something that I am passionate about and have found myself in situations like these.

Another bill that I would like to introduce would be initiating more community engaging events within Isla Vista that bring the people that live off-campus together. Oftentimes, many college students see their living situation as just that, a living situation, and do not fully recognize that Isla Vista is a community. Although on a map, it is a mere 2 square miles, it feels much larger, hence why there always feels like there is a disconnect between all of the subsections of IV. With community engaging events such as a holiday decoration house contest, it brings the IV community together for a friendly competition and overall improves our appearance. I believe that with these small events, it will help modestly boost the moral of IV. I will work with the IV Community Center as well as the proper entities necessary.
","One of my overarching goals centers around boosting the community moral and how we can make our community stronger and tighter. Isla Vista is a community that relies on the support of one another to be successful and to thrive. Some people see IV as merely just a living space, but do not recognize the true potential that our great community offers. At the end of the day, we are all Gaucho’s with the common purpose of going to school at UCSB, but we all have a part in making each other’s college experience the best it can be. To reiterate a few of my platforms, with the creation of a donation center, increased community events, and increased resources for under-represented groups, I believe that it will effectively solve a couple issues that my constituents may feel. Please see the above question, for some expansion about a couple of my platforms and how I would achieve them.","As I answered previously in questions 3, 4, and 5 I want to work with the IT department and the proper management teams that facilitate social media advertisements in creating a better way of displaying school/community events within Isla Vista. Specifically, I want to implement digital billboards on Pardall Tunnel that will screen information 24/7. I would also like to work with the A.S. Food Bank, Pardall Center, and the Isla Vista Community Center in creating more safe spaces for underrepresented groups, initiating a donation center, and hosting more community events. Of course, I will also speak and work with any other organizations or entities, because my vision may not incorporate a valid viewpoint to which someone might have.","With the uncertainty of the course of COVID-19 within the U.S., many institutions are considering making courses online for the summer and fall quarters. I hope this is not the case, but if it is, I will make myself available through opening up office hours via Zoom weekly so that I can get any input from my constituents regarding their general needs or concerns. Especially during these times of unprecedented amounts of Xenophobia against Asian-Americans, I want to be there for my communities and make sure that they recognize they have support from the campus. Hatred, racism, and xenophobia are not welcomed to our campus and it is with proper communication that I can be notified of any instances that occur.

I will also make myself available through my social media accounts. Whether it be Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat I will make sure that the students recognize that I am just a message away. Another way that I will make sure that my constituents recognize that I am a resource that they can go to, is going to club meetings if they are held online. Even having just a quick 2 minute announcement, it will allow for the exposure to know that I will be there for them. 
","One of the main reasons why I believe that I can serve as Off-Campus senator well, is my ability to continually learn and be flexible while maintaining my integrity. I recognize that A.S. and the issues that surround a college campus will never be stagnant. With the position of a Senator, one should be educated upon their stance on a certain subject, but should still be open to discourse and the exchange of ideas from other perspectives. Many exterior issues will inadvertently affect our campus in more ways than one. Having a properly informed opinion as a senator is extremely important, and I believe that this is one of my strengths. Before deciding on a definitive stance, I prefer to make sure that I speak with the proper communities in which the subject may directly affect.

Being a supervisor at the Arbor and holding chair positions within my fraternity, I recognize the importance of all parts that go into running an institution such as ours. No matter how big or small their roles are, we all come together for the betterment of UCSB. If I am elected as an Off-Campus senator, I will be super excited to work with my fellow Senate cabinet and the Executive officers in tackling goals for next year. I understand the importance of all of our roles in making sure that all of the needs of the student body are addressed.",Left-Leaning/Centrist,"Excellent- I think that the A.S. Senate did a great job in tending to the needs of the student body and emphasizing their role as a support system to the campus. Many unplanned events happened this year that definitely affected the campus, but the way that they handled the situations were fair and objective.","At this time, I believe the information that I know about the movement is insufficient in making a proper and informed stance. Before solidifying anything, I would want to do my own research, speak with the administration, and proponents/opponents to divestment. I recognize, however, that UCSB has a very different culture than the other UC campuses that have passed resolutions regarding the movement and whatever stance that I come to should be mindful of our community. ","In a perfect world, I do believe higher education should be tuition-free. The University of California system was founded on the basis that they would be a public institution that was free and accessible to everyone who lived in California. However, with education now linked with government and the economy, it has not become the case. I do believe UCSB should be tuition-free because financial burdens are a huge issue for students today debating if they want to pursue higher education. That should not be the case.","There are a lot of mental health services available to the student body such as CAPS and the SMHCS. They offer great resources for those who are struggling with a spectrum of problems, ranging from small to large ones. I have personally not used the mental health services here, but I think it is a vital and essential part of the campus. It is reassuring to know that if any problems should occur within my life, there is a dedicated center to help me. However, with any resource on campus, there are many areas in which we can improve upon, especially in regards to mental health resources.

On one part, I believe that a particular reason why people do not reach out and utilize these resources is because of the stigma of mental health. As an Asian-American, a large part of my upbringing was concealing my emotions and learning that my emotions were considered a “taboo”. It wasn’t until college where proper education allowed me to self-destigmatize this preconceived notion. 

This is an area in which I believe the mental health services can be improved upon. Many people oftentimes have the same beliefs as I did and therefore do not consider CAPS and other resources an option. De-stigmatization of mental health and leading healthy conversations is an essential part of overcoming an issue. More advocacy and more education about the normality of these things can be done. More private options can also be made available for those who are uncomfortable with being seen using these resources in public. This goes back to the whole notion how people still view mental health as a taboo. 
","This situation was a very complex and sensitive subject that required a lot of careful investigation, which was in part why many believed the response to be slow. It was a very serious matter that had to be dealt firmly, which subsequently was why the Interfraternity Council placed all the fraternities under social moratorium for the remainder of the quarter. It serves as an important reminder that change must be made with these organizations that place their traditions and systems on archaic routines.

One way that they could have handled the situation better is being more transparent about the whole process. I do believe that quicker action must have been dealt with time-sensitive matters such as these. I am not sure if the administration gave sufficient support and resources to the survivor, but this is an area that can be clarified and refined. The administration should stand and protect survivors in their journey to healing. With the administration, I felt as if they sent out the emails outlining the reports but no later actions were made clear. However, we need to know what the victim wanted as it's a sensitive issue and the university can’t take any action without the approval of the survivor. Although the university did not act as harshly and as explicitly as the people would have wanted, the Interfraternity council took actions and precautions that they deemed necessary in the situation. These new regulations were made in collaboration with OSL. 
","Title IX has encouraged great progress within our society but leaves some things left in question. Although I am not completely knowledgeable with all of the special cases of Title IX, one of the main issues that people see is that it uses terms such as “sex” instead of “gender”. This has allowed the federal government to interpret the Act, sometimes differently. I am not too sure, but I believe Title IX does not provide complete and total protection for some groups, especially within the LGTBQ+ community. Those who identify as trasngender, intersex, or non-binary may not be guaranteed total protection and is up to the discretion of the school. I may be wrong, but I believe this area is lacking through my research.

Another area that Title IX fails to do in terms of addressing sexual assault is that it does not support and protect the survivor enough. Under Betsy Devos, she definitely puts a lot more emphasis on protecting the accused rather than using her power to defend for the survivor. Especially during this era where so many of those accused of sexual assault are able to walk away with minimal punishments, action must be taken. Those who are survivors of sexual assault must feel secured and backed by the legislation of Title IX.
","As a member of the Asian-American and the LGBTQ+ communities, I think that UCSB has done well in solidifying our visibility and protecting our identities. Disregarding administration actions, the entirety of the campus is overwhelmingly supportive of these minority groups and generally recognize that efforts should be made in providing resources to these underrepresented groups. UCSB really emphasizes the importance of community to the student body which has done many wonderful things in uniting our campus.The Student Resource Building and the Multi-Cultural Center provide many great resources and events for our minority groups and have safe spaces that are dedicated to us, whether it be learning about a different culture or learning about our own.

With any institution, improvements can always be made. An area that UCSB could improve upon however is the creation of more safe spaces on campus, and more advocacy to utilize these resources. Not enough publitization is done for these useful services and should be made more clear to students that they are here. The Asian-American population has a dedicated Asian Resource Center within the SRB which doubles as a safe space. I’m not too familiar with how many people utilize this space, but I know that for those who are not involved in any cultural organization, their participation is low. We need to target these demographics where they may not be a part of any organization, and thus feel not able to utilize these spaces as well. 
","If I am elected to serve in the Senate, one of the first bills that I would like to pass is a bill that initiates a donation center within Isla Vista. This would be in conjunction with the other initiative to bring a Food Bank to Isla Vista as well. Food waste is a large issue within any college town, and organizations such as the IV Compost Collective can only do so much. By allowing donations of non-perishable foods and other supplies that students in need can benefit from, this will not only help with cutting down our food waste but also help combat the issue of food insecurity. While spending my time living in Isla Vista, I’ve also noticed that there is a large homeless population. With this donation center, I would hope to make this accessible to the less fortunate because they are a part of our community. More information about this platform can be seen in Question 4.","As a senator I would advocate for more open forums and meetings with students. I think it is incredibly important to recognize and validate everyone’s opinion because many matters directly affect the student body and certain groups. Again, I think that areas that I would improve upon are the visibility of the events. Not many people know when or if there are events that allow student discourse about certain matters. Although the A.S. The Senate has a good spectrum of different groups here on campus, inevitably there will be some groups that will not be represented, and it is important to have their voices heard.

I would publicize and make meetings more accessible for all students on campus. We need to utilize the platforms that we have such as the A.S. facebook page or instagram. Encouraging people to follow these platforms is the first step in making people aware of the events that the Associated Students hold. Another thing that I would work to do is to hold educational events that will help give students information to make informed stances about certain matters. Of course, I would also look and discuss with other student governments from other schools and see what their procedures are to involve their student body. It is good to draw from inspirations where other school governments have large student action. No student government will be perfect, but we can take the necessary actions to be the best version that we can be. 
","What the next UC President should prioritize in securing a holistic system that protects and does not exploit the undergraduate, graduate, and staff bodies. The relationships and interplay between these three groups are very delicate and interwoven. Any subsequent mistreatment or negligence to one body, affects the other two substantially. As we can see from the COLA strikes that gained momentum across the UC campuses, the graduate students went on strike for fairer wages. This led to undergraduate and staff being affected directly. Areas that also should be focused are the support of first-generation students and marginalized groups that need the security. Many of these groups do not have the same resources when applying into college/are in college compared to those who identify with higher classes. They are oftentimes dealt with extraneous circumstances that inhibit their full potentials. By prioritizing these groups, the UC system can undoubtedly be elevated. Another priority that should be looked at is dedicating a mental health task force.",,,,,,,
Kaitlyn Medland,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaitlyn-Medland-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,2nd ,Political Science and History of Public Policy and Law Double Major ,,,"Being involved in our student community through various forms of student government has led me to run to be an off-campus senator with the 71st senate. Encountering students who are passionate about and motivated to create programs and entities to represent the entire student body was the greatest factor when I was considering running. I want to create and enact these programs that uplift all students. I will ensure that I do this through collaborating with the students I currently know, and the students I will reach out to. Our students have demands, and these demands deserve to be listened to, asked about, and understood by our senate. I ensure this will happen if I am a senator, and in turn, the entirety of AS will be more inclusive of student opinions and become a greater resource for students. There exists a multitude of ways in which Associated Students can be a greater asset to UCSB students; I intend to use the resources AS retains to ensure that students are well represented.","Campus involvement, particularly being a student leader, has been a priority for me since my freshman year. I have a strong desire to work with students to create a better community in which we are all accounted for, accepted, and aided. In my first year, I was elected to be president of San Miguel Hall in which I led weekly meetings to fund and organize programs within our residence hall, along with serving as a liaison to the Residential Housing Association in which I represented San Miguel and helped organize All Hall events. This opportunity greatly enhanced my skills in communication, organization, and leadership. I met weekly with students and professional staff to ensure I was carrying out my duties in a way that represented all of San Miguel. If elected to the 71st senate, I am positive these attributes will aid me in being the best senator I can be. In my second year, I have served as the Fund the UC Campaign Coordinator in the EVPSA office and as the vice president of a new club, PERIOD chapter. As the FTUC Coordinator, I have worked in promoting legislation such as Prop 13 and the Summer Cal Grant, to enhance our schools and increase affordability of higher education. I have also traveled to other UC’s to meet with other FTUC coordinators in order to conduct greater outreach. In this position, I have become more confident in reviewing and understanding state legislation which will be an asset to my work if I am elected to be a senator. As vice president of PERIOD chapter, I have listened to student demands for free menstrual products through creating an organization that serves to eliminate period poverty and menstrual stigma. In this position, I have worked with campus staff and AS entities to secure funding and locations to place these menstrual products to be accessible to students. These experiences with collaborative effort and steadfastness will make me a great senator as I understand the process of student, facility, and AS collaboration that is necessary to establish change on our campus.","IV Food Bank: In collaboration with other senators, the current food bank, and the Food Security and Basic Needs Task Fforce, I would author a bill to establish an IV Food Bank. As for the logistics of location, I would need to meet with the IVCSD and Goleta county officials. This food bank would operate on the same system as the UCen food bank in which students swipe in with their access card and can pick out donated food items and toiletries. This food bank would offer more employment opportunities to students, along with increasing food security for students living in IV as this food bank would ideally be open on the weekends. 

Resolution to support the creation of a gender neutral restroom in every building on campus: Many of our on campus buildings do not have gender neutral restrooms, which negatively impacts many of our students. In each building where it is applicable, this resolution would support the creation of a gender-neutral restroom. 


Resolution to support the allowance of an excused personal day per quarter: In many of our on-campus jobs and mandatory class meetings, students are not allowed a personal, sick, or mental health day without a documented doctor’s visit and note. If we do not provide this documentation, we are at risk of being fired from our jobs or lose points from our grade in classes. This places students without health insurance, or transportation to a medical facility, in a precarious situation. They ultimately take on the risk of termination or a bad grade if they fall sick or become overwhelmed, requiring a personal day. In this resolution, I would partner with the Commission on Student Wellbeing and other senators, to support the establishment of an excused personal day across all campus jobs and class meetings. This excused personal day, as of now, would be allotted once per quarter. However, this may change upon meeting with other students, the Academic Senate, staff, and faculty. There would not be required documentation for this personal day, employers nor faculty could ask for the reason as to why a student needs the personal day so as not to encroach on their personal lives. There cannot exist any repercussions for the taking of a personal day. This resolution would greatly benefit the wellbeing of all students. ","The primary goals of my platform, and what I hope to achieve in office, is the expansion of resources to Isla Vista and enhancing the wellbeing of our students and in turn, our community. To expand resources to IV, I hope to work with AS executive offices, other senators, and AS entities. I hope to provide free menstrual products across campus and in IV spaces operated by AS such as Pardall Center. To achieve this, I will work with the organization I am vice president of, PERIOD Chapter, and the AS Womxn’s Commission to attain funding and student aid in constructing this program. I also hope to enhance study space in Pardall Center and the IV Community Center through providing more charging ports and comfortable seating. To achieve this, I will work with other senators and these locations to enhance these spaces to provide more study locations for students living in IV. I also hope to work with the current food bank along with the food security and basic needs taskforce to establish an IV food bank that is open on the weekends.

As for wellbeing, I hope to focus on the health of students and the Isla Vista environment through working with AS and local government entities. In collaboration with the Mental Health Task Force, I hope to propose funding requests to local government officials, such as Joan Hartmann, that would fund free mental health counseling at Acacia in IV. This would aid students in acquiring free mental health services outside the long wait times at CAPS. I would also make student health a priority through working the IV Tenants Union and AS Lobby Corps in pressuring landlords and homeowners to enhance IV housing and routinely test for mold. This would protect the health of our students living in IV and promote student understanding of the demands we can make to our landlords. Enhancing the cleanliness of IV streets is the last portion of my platform. To achieve this, I hope to establish IV recycling centers in which IV residents can donate their cans, glass, and bottles to receive money back. For this program, I hope to work with Goleta county officials, the Environmental Affairs Board, and the Zero Waste Committee. This program would aid in cleaning up waste on our streets and paying our students for doing so. Another program to clean IV streets I hope to implement is employing homeless or unemployed individuals in IV and Goleta county to pick up trash at least once a week. IV, due to the density, cannot have street sweepers barrel through. This program would enhance the cleanliness of our streets and aid in the financial security of our community. To achieve this, I hope to work with Goleta county officials, the IV Community Services District, and the Isla Vista Community Relations Committee. 
","This is stated above as listed with each of my individual goals. However I will list each entity I plan to work with here. This is not a complete list as I hope to collaborate with as many organizations as possible to make sure each policy and program I draft is inclusive of the entire student body. This list, if I am elected to be senator, will be expanded as I conduct more outreach and learn of more student groups. The list is as follows: AS Senate, AS Executive Offices, AS Advisors, PERIOD Chapter, AS Womxn’s Commission, Pardall Center, IV Community Center, Food Bank, Mental Health Task Force, local government officials such as Joan Hartmann, IVTU, Lobby Corps, Goleta County, Environmental Affairs Board, Zero Waste Committee, IVCSD, and the IVCRC.","If we are unable to hold in person office hours and meetings, I will ensure that I am as accessible as possible through email, social media, and zoom. On my senator Facebook profile, I will make weekly posts detailing my contact information and zoom access for office hours or private meetings. These posts would be made the day before I plan to hold office hours so as to allow time for students to schedule the time they wish to meet or email me with any questions or concerns. As for zoom, I would be logged on during my scheduled office hours and students could join and leave at any point during that time slot. I would also create anonymous google forms, posted to my social media profiles, asking students to submit their comments or concerns. These anonymous forms would also be used to gauge student reaction to events happening within our campus community. For example, I would have created one in reaction to Chancellor Yang’s abrupt decision to tell students to go home, and not return to campus, given the Coronavirus pandemic. These responses then would have been used as student testimony in meetings and communications with the Chancellor on the hardships that decision created for many students, and how those hardships should be resolved by the university. In turn, even if I were to be on campus, or home in San Diego, I would ensure that I am serving UCSB students and remaining open to work for them.","I believe I am the best candidate for off-campus senator as I have worked to enhance our student community for the past two years. I have worked with students from various organizations and of differing beliefs on and off campus to enhance the UCSB experience for ALL students. I will ensure that I am listening to and reaching out to students with different perspectives in order to construct my votes, resolutions, and bills in complete support of the entire student body. I will stay true to my belief in uplifting students in need. I will provide outlets for students to engage with AS that allows for true inclusion, rather than me simply acting as my own voice, speaking on my beliefs. I understand that the purpose of being an off-campus senator is to speak for the students living in IV. But, I do not wish to impose my views on IV students, Instead, I will ensure I am engaging with the IV community and listening to their demands to shape how I will act as a senator. I will listen, I will work hard, I will complete all tasks on time, and most importantly I will serve. I refuse to act on my own interests. If elected, I will act on the interests of my constituents to create a community that is inclusive of all and provides an enhanced experience at UCSB.","I am left-leaning in politics at all levels. I align with the democratic platform and, in particular, more liberal beliefs. Despite my political beliefs, I will always listen and converse with students to create policies on our campus that are inclusive of all students.","Overall, I personally believe this year’s senate did a very good job of addressing the needs of the student body. Particularly, through the amendment proposed by Senators Ferguson and Swanson to incorporate two senate seats for international students; I believe this is one of the most important and excellent acts of this year’s Senate. However, to be considered excellent, the 71st AS Senate must create greater communication between students and AS to truly understand and act on the needs of the entire student body.","As I am not a member of the Israeli or Palestinian nations or communities, I am not equipped to answer whether or not I would vote in favor of the divestment resolution. Instead, I have already begun to reach out to UCSB students to understand their perspective on divestment; this is educating me on the debate along with allowing me to understand how various students feel. If elected, I would continue this outreach and come to a conclusion on my vote at that time.","With the ample amount of provided services and resources, I understand that UCSB cannot be tuition-free. However, I do believe our tuition should be lowered to ease the financial burden on our students and their families. Most students encounter financial stress for various reasons and this places a strain on their academics. In my opinion, there is an immense waste with the handling of our tuition and fees. This waste ultimately makes higher education inaccessible for a large proportion of young adults, whether their families are considered low-income or middle class. Financial stress should not plague students seeking higher education.","The mental health services at UCSB are greatly insufficient. When students are forced to wait two weeks for an appointment with our CAPS office or turned down for immediate counseling, our mental health services are failing us. To counteract this, we need to continue the work of the Mental Health Task Force as they are in collaboration with the current AS President Alison Sir. The Task Force has done well in promoting on-campus mental health resources outside of CAPS. This awareness must be increased through postings around campus, push emails, and social media outreach to ensure that all students know the multitude of mental health resources we have access to. 

We also need to provide increased mental health awareness programs throughout the WHOLE quarter, rather than strictly emphasizing the importance of mental health during finals week. Although we do need these measures during finals week, they are lacking throughout the first ten weeks. Our mental health should be made a priority by the administration, our faculty, our jobs, and our student government. To ensure this, I hope to work with other Senate members and executive offices to pressure the administration to allow us mental health relief days each quarter, in which we are excused from work or class if need be to receive counseling or to relax and conduct self-care for the day. These days would not require a doctor’s note so as to relieve worries of having medical insurance. I believe these relief days would greatly benefit our students. 
","Although I understand the University took time to draft a proper response and conduct a thorough investigation, their radio silence regarding the sexual assault allegations was deafening. The anger and frustration students possessed at the university’s minimal response caused many students to discredit the university’s power to protect all students, and in particular, sexual assault victims. To address the situation, and to protect all of our students, the university should have suspended activities of the alleged fraternity after the FIRST sexual assault of the quarter was reported, rather than placing control of the situation in the hands of the IFC. This may seem harsh, but this may have prevented the assault of other students. This would have indicated the severity of the allegation and the means to which the university would support sexual assault victims on our campus. Although the fraternity houses are not campus property, our students occupy these houses whether as residents or guests. Even in Isla Vista, our safety should be the university’s priority. The university failed to protect us through their slow response to these horrid events.","Title IX is not an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Under this system, the perpetrator is endowed with more protections than the victim is. This is particularly evident on our own campus, given the events in Fall of 2019 when the university neglected to inform the student body of the sexual assault on fraternity property in a timely manner. Through this, the university was protecting the members of that fraternity despite the horrid allegations made. Our students were thus still interacting with dangerous persons, due to UCSB abiding by Title IX regulations on investigations into sexual assault allegations. The reform of this system is under state discretion. However, I would work with the EVPSA executive office to engage with legislation regarding Title IX and pressure our campus administration, along with all the UC’s, to propose reforms to this system to properly address sexual assault on our campuses. Through the voice and power of all UC administrations, and particularly the UC Student Association which is a team of the UC external vice presidents and their core team, we can allow for our demands to change Title IX, and to protect victims of sexual assault, to be enacted.","I believe that students aligning with these historically underrepresented groups are those who are effectively crafting and serving their own communities, not necessarily just UCSB’s faculty or advisors. While AS has successfully established incorporated entities to serve these communities, the students are the ones who have tirelessly fought to be included and maintain the space they deserve on our campus. In the past few years and even since my time on this campus, I believe UCSB has made significant strides in incorporating these underrepresented groups. However, I argue that UCSB could be more proactive in the inclusion of underrepresented groups. There needs to exist greater outreach from the UCSB administration and Associated Students to underrepresented groups through their organizations, for example, BSU, Hermanxs, and Queer Student Union. These groups should not have to solely rely on their efforts to be represented on campus, but rather they should be uplifted, primarily by Associated Students.","If elected to serve on the 71st AS Senate, the first bill I plan to author will be to support the opening of an Isla Vista food bank. Food insecurity plagues a significant portion of our students; many UCSB students do not know if they will be able to supply their next meal. Although I believe the UCen food bank has greatly aided our students, a food bank in IV, that is also open on the weekends, would enhance food security amongst our student population. This proposed food bank would operate on the same system as that in the UCen; students would check other students in with our access cards, permitting them to grab the available food items. This measure would thus provide another employment opportunity for students and supply students with greater accessibility to healthy food throughout the entire week. Through establishing a food bank in IV, we would be aiding financial and food security amongst our student population residing off-campus.","The current operation of accessibility to our AS elected positions is insufficient. Office hours are published once, maybe twice a quarter, and students rarely visit these outreach hours due to class, work, or personal conflicts. Town halls work well to allow students a forum to express concerns on various issues, but they are rarely sufficiently advertised or attended. The greatest conflict in accessibility is the lack of knowledge regarding AS. The majority of students I’ve spoken with about my current position in the EVPSA office have little to no knowledge about AS. To counteract this, and teach our student population about AS, its services, and actions, I propose a greater social media presence and weekly email updates. All AS offices and members should be required to provide weekly updates on their AS social media accounts about projects they are working on and how students can critique or become involved with the project. I propose these updates also be sent out through email to notify the entire student body of the work each AS entity is conducting. This will also benefit the entire AS body by holding us accountable.","The next UC President must value students higher than profit. They must listen to and consider faculty, student, and worker demands. After all, a leader is only as great as their ability to listen to the people they serve. This is something that Janet Napolitano lacks, and in turn has received intense backlash from across the UC campuses. In the next UC President, I believe the top attributes I am searching for is compassion, professionalism, and adaptability. Compassion to listen to demands within the UC system, professionalism when handling crises, and adaptability to changing standards amongst faculty, students, and workers. We must not continue to accept a UC President that disregards our opinions and implements policies that are detrimental to our campuses. The next UC President must understand the varying backgrounds of those who occupy the UC system and ensure they are all accounted for and accommodated.",,,,,,,
Dylan Martinez,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dylan-Martinez-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,he/him/his,3rd,Environmental Studies ,,,"The 2020s are off to an unbelievable start, and while nobody anticipated this is the place we’d be at three months ago, I’m a glass-half-full kinda guy. Before this pandemic and the life changes that came with it, I thought I was running to give back to a community I loved deeply, and to combat our self-perpetuating cycle of apathy towards student government. While that’s still true, I believe this year will be especially crucial in addressing glaring weaknesses across our campus and society exposed by the pandemic. We have to remember that students are this campus, and though our collective power is underutilized, it can be fierce and formidable. Nobody remembers that UCSB’s collective voice was once so potent that Storke Plaza was intentionally sunk into the ground to control our protests, and then-Governor Reagan sent in the National Guard to calm us down. I’m not advocating that level of discontent, but we need to reinvigorate that level of energy and channel it for positive, genuine change. We’re multitaskers at heart, and there’s no reason we can’t fix obvious problems with our campus (lack of menstrual products in all bathrooms) while simultaneously rallying thousands of Gauchos to lobby for substantial structural change (significant reduction and elimination of tuition). If there ever is a time for apathy and cynicism, it’s certainly not now. I’m running to make AS work for everybody – students, sanitation workers, TAs, faculty, food hall workers, underrepresented groups, faculty. Everybody, no catch. AS doesn’t need to be a phantom organization that only crosses your mind once a year in the spring – it can, and should, be engaging with our community throughout the year to make everybody’s lives easier.","I previously served in the Creative Media Unit of AS as one of two marketing directors, and as Service Chair with Phi Sigma Pi honors fraternity; am currently serving as the Director of Student Life with the Office of the Student Advocate and as marketing director with UCSB Adventure Programs. Particularly going through the leadership training course and leading subsequent trips outdoors has developed my leadership skills in tough situations. Logistics, planning, and foresight are paramount on those trips, as well as adaptability when things fall apart. That level of flexibility is something I anticipate will be a strength as a senator, where teamwork and give-and-take are the name of the game. As service chair, I had the opportunity to meet leaders across our Goleta and SB communities, organizing short and long-term service projects. I love working with people and learning about the ways people are already taking charge to better IV and the surrounding area. As Director of Student Life with the OSA, I’ve learned about all the resources at the disposal of students in judicial trouble, and how to best protect their interests. Being part of this community the last 3 years has been a gift, and I want to return the favor.","The number one issue facing our society is climate change. As such, I’d present a bill establishing a natural disaster relief fund to assist at-need students. In the three years I’ve been at UCSB, we’ve experienced two wildfire disasters, mudslides, and cliff erosion. I lived on DP last year, and the houses on either side of us both had their backyards collapse. Neither units are rented out now. We need to get ahead of this issue and proactively retreat from the coast before we see serious repercussions. This fund would facilitate relocating disadvantaged students, preparing for the next fires and eventual “Big One” earthquake, and stockpiling resources so that our campus isn’t completely paralyzed when disaster strikes. On a smaller scale, another bill I’d present would direct the allocation of funds to add outlets to all floors and study spaces of the library. This is a small upgrade that would go a long way – we’re a digital campus where a laptop is all but required, and students should always have access to charging the devices they need to do schoolwork. Beyond traditional schoolwork, however, I would push to bring back UCSB’s “living classes” – back in the 1990s, our campus used to offer classes in bartending and home-ec. For whatever reason, these were eliminated, and I would author a resolution lobbying for their return, in subjects such as graphic design, financial literacy, and bartending. In our 21st century skills economy, it’s not just about what you learn in the classroom, but what technical skills you have. It’s important we prepare ourselves as best we can for the job market, including in ways you might not find in a traditional class.","In recognition of existing bureaucracy and hoops to jump through, my platform is centered on goals realistically achievable within a calendar year. Namely: requiring free menstrual products throughout campus, adding outlets to all study spaces of the library, preventing waitlisted units from counting towards your pass time total, and establishing a more efficient meal-swipe system. These are small but important changes I believe can be made in a term. I also hope to engage diverse groups of Gauchos in the process to reach loftier goals: the establishment of a natural disaster relief fund; creating a fund to allow financially disadvantaged students to participate in extracurriculars they might not otherwise be able to afford; and substantially reducing (if not outright eliminating) the cost of student healthcare. This job is self-directed and self-motivated. Once election season is over, I will make myself as visible as possible and reach out to groups typically left out of the conversation. I’ll show up to meetings for random orgs to find out what their needs are and let them know they have a direct connection into AS. I want to be a face that doesn’t disappear after election season, that different orgs and groups get to know over the course of my term, and who’s on the ground engaging with the people who need it most. I’ll push hard to put my ideas into practice, meeting people where they are, and pressuring our administration as much as possible to get it done. ","I want to work with UCSB’s Mental Health Task Force to build on their work in destigmatizing mental health issues and promoting resources we have in place, such as our Alcohol & Drug Programs and Health and Wellness Center. We can also do more for our underrepresented communities by holding smaller, more intimate town halls with university administrators so that their needs are directly heard, and better understood by the people at the top. This includes partnering with orgs like the RCSGD, Pan Asian Network, the AdCRC, Black Student Engagement Program, and WGSE, to name a few. I also want to partner with our Design, Facilities, & Safety Services unit to lobby and secure funding to make desperately needed upgrades to our campus. While it’s wonderful we have the $50 million Henley Hall going up on campus, and the “Classroom Building Project” sprouting up soon between the Library and Psych building, we also have students crammed into triples in most of our dorms, and an overall housing shortage in IV. Our 2010 Long Range Development Plan calls for new freshman doors, as well as an overall increase in housing capacity, so it’s my priority to lobby for donations and grants to be able to put our students first and increase UCSB’s housing capabilities.","I will hold office hours over Zoom and be available over Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for anyone who needs to talk. If org groups across campus also decided to hold meetings on Zoom, I’d ask to attend to get the best understanding possible of what their needs and concerns are. I would also push for virtual town halls on a wide range of issues, including building on the first mental health town hall we had last quarter. We could even utilize resources like Slack and Discord to continue community organizing in the most effective way possible while not being in person. We can still work for and improve Isla Vista remotely, so I’d try to use social media for the greatest good possible – polls, stimulating discussion and engagement in comments, reaching out to organizations directly, sharing resources, and posting stuff that makes people smile. We’re all in this together, and if we’re still stuck inside by the time fall rolls around, it’s our job as student leaders to keep our community united and looking on the bright side of things.","I’m graduating next year. I’m not putting my hat into the ring as a stepping stone to my next AS job, or as a resume builder, or because I find this fun. I’m doing this because I’ve been on this campus three years, loving every second of it while also recognizing deeply-ingrained flaws in our culture, administration, and way of operation. These problems are by no means specific to UCSB, but I genuinely believe this is a unique group of people we have in Isla Vista and on campus – a work hard, play hard hybrid community with a distinctive culture that is definitively ours . I want to lead the way in establishing ourselves as a national model for what university done right looks like. I have ideas that I want to implement, goals to set for our entire campus, and I believe I can engage in a cross-demographic and cross-cultural style effectively and consistently. I’m part of the Latinx and LGBT communities here, while also being part of the outdoors community; as I’ve gone through my Chinese minor, I’ve come to know many amazing international students, and also had experience with AS and our professional fraternities. I want to leave this place better than I found it, and I know I have the motivation, experience, and strategy to get actual things done – and that’s the ultimate theme of this campaign. I don’t want anyone to look back on my time as a senator and say, “Who was that? What the hell did he do?” I’m not at all saying I want my name on everything – just that my time will be spent in the offices of people who can do what I can’t alone, with organizations whose needs have been overlooked, and reaching out directly to people left out of the process. No flashy, ostentatious resolutions on Donald Trump or Israel; my focus will be squarely on this community and how we can move it forward. I love people and this school, and that’s why I’m running for this position.","(A) Left-leaning, but I’m non-ideological; I prefer to look at issues holistically and separately.","(B) Very good; adding international student senate seats was a huge step forward in recognizing the contributions and presence of our international student community. They passed responsive resolutions to pesticide, support for the COLA movement, and ushered in a significantly more cooperative environment. We have a strong foundation to build upon.","Yes; this is a complicated issue, all facets of which cannot possibly be addressed in 100 words, but I will always vote to defend human rights, no matter the regime and no matter the implications, including within our own country.","Yes; the University of California was founded on this premise. Higher education should not lie on the other side of a high financial barrier that only some families can surmount. Everybody should be able to better themselves, regardless of their financial situation, and money is a colossal and highly unnecessary headache for families. I am in favor of all UCs and Cal States being tuition free. ","No, and through no fault of the amazing staff we currently have working at CAPS, our Student Mental Health Coordinators, etc. Our mental health support apparatus is chronically underfunded. Long-term therapy sessions is an immediate necessity, along with strengthening our Mental Health Peers and School Anxiety programs. Securing the funds to add just a few more psychologists could get that many more people in to get the help they need. However, we need to increase awareness of the wide array of mental health support programs we already have in place, such as C.A.R.E., the Student Mental Health Coordination office, Health & Wellness Center, and Career Services, to name a few. Of course, situations vary and some students may find better support tailored to their unique experiences with orgs like the RCSGD or Veterans Resource Team. To get that help, they need to know these support systems exist, so one of my top priorities is increasing outreach. Mental health problems can be debilitating and may feel shameful to bring up, so the onus is on us to make these programs as easily accessible as humanly possible. Because some issues are so crippling, as with the flu or cold, students should be permitted to use mental health days without penalty when attending class is simply too much. As a campus, we need to destigmatize mental health issues and prioritize fully funding the programs that make the greatest impact. The infrastructure already exists!","Sexual assaults at fraternity houses is not a new development. The university must do better and demonstrate the level of seriousness these cases require. Pushing defense strategies, while important, should not be the focus of any comprehensive response to this systemic issue. The university needs to be addressing the root issues at play here, and supporting survivors should be their foremost priority. In handling the Fall 2019 cases specifically, the university should have released the names of the fraternities under investigation so that students can make their own decisions about who and what organizations they want to affiliate with. Thoroughness is paramount, but transparency at each step of the process is of equal importance, and we didn’t see that from the actions the administration took.","The system as it stands has some serious flaws and obviously varies case by case, but currently errs on the side of the accused rather than the survivor. The system is better than nothing, but that’s not good enough. Crucially, the university does not follow up if a student doesn’t respond following their immediate complaint, and I do believe they should investigate further in this case. Following an assault, a survivor’s state of mind can range widely, and if there is insufficient information, it’s the university’s duty to follow up themselves. It is the university that sets the tone and timeline, and “not enough information” is a weak response – go get the information. Don’t claim to be doing all you can to prevent rape culture when you verifiably are not. They are the principal authoritative body that can do this, and not doing such is a failing of shameful proportions.","There is always work to do in improving student life for minority groups, and today there exists a wide array of resources for students. As a society, there’s still a lot of work we have to do. I believe our school culture is changing for the better, and that stems from student leaders who take initiative. The UCSB community is moving in the right direction and making great strides toward more equitable representation, a greater understanding of different cultures, and a united sense of community","I will author a bill that seeks to create a natural disaster relief fund. Del Playa is an at-risk stretch of land that landlords will continue to rent out, even as bluffs retreat at 2-14 inches per year (varying address to address). We should proactively create a fund to help students who find themselves forced to relocate mid-year, working hand in hand with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and as well as advocate for the proactive demolition of especially dangerous properties. An organized retreat from the coast is necessary, and would save lives.","I will be visible not just during the campaign season, but throughout my entire term and seek out individual student voices. Whether that’s showing up to different org’s events or chatting with people in the library, my goal is proactivity. Cynicism about AS runs pretty deep, so the onus is on senators to identify problems, energize our community to act collectively, and urge people to use the agency they have to affect change. If we can make change that’s visible, and that directly engages the concerns of diverse groups of students, we can create a student government that actually gives us a seat at the table, rather than the image of an elite group of resume-builders.","The leader of the University of California should not be an entrenched politician, should not be someone who’s going to mislead us on where our money is going, and who will not fire TAs who are asking for a living wage. We need somebody who’s been in the classroom and whose focus is education and societal advancement, not the advancement of their career. It is crucial that the next UC president is close to the issues that matter to students, TAs, and faculty. Their top priority should be compensating our graduate students fairly, expanding university housing, and operating transparently.",,,,,,,
Bruce Fan,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bruce-Fan-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,1st ,Economics ,,,"I am running to be an off-campus senator with the 71st senate because of my passion for serving the UCSB community and voice for student groups that are previously underheard. It is always my dream to participate in the decision-making process at my university, and it is genuinely a self-rewarding experience by witnessing the improvement of my campus through my efforts. I also recognize the changes and impacts one can make as a leader from my past leadership experience at high school. As a student from China, I realize that the large-portion presence of international students does not always indicate a corresponding representation in our student government. Furthermore, I believe that my unique experience and background allow me to act as a bridge between various and distinct cultures and peoples and communicate their respective concerns and needs. By running for senator, I recognize the rising challenges that impose in front of me, but I believe that such courage is necessary to facilitate positive changes and transform the community to become ever diverse and tolerant. International students need someone to address their concerns and fight for their interests, and UCSB needs someone who has a certain degree of understanding of both domestic and international issues. For these reasons, I am running to be the next off-campus senator with my visions and plans in hopes of a more academic-friendly, safer, and more convenient campus.","As a Student Representative at Large in the Internal Affairs Committee, although my term has not officially begun, I have done important things that make our campus better. In February, even before Covid-19 had attracted serious attention in the United States, I had decided to address certain students’ concerns regarding the transparency of the situation and potential preventing measures to the Chancellor’s office. I still remember that friendly conversation with Ms. O’Brien, and I was glad to see her taking notes on our concerns and Student Health making an announcement that afternoon. It was the first time I took the step to send a message and seek responses, which succeeded, in my opinion. I decided to take a shot thanks to my international friends from China, and they knew that the situation was grave from their families and friends. In addition, I have led the process of writing joint letters and petitions to UCSB with international students to de-triple dorms and maximize social distancing. Besides these moves, I also actively participate in forums related to criminal justice reform and events hosted by various culture clubs such as CSSA. I have also visited much rental housing in IV and examined their conditions carefully since I have some friends who live there, and I feel their suggestions, along with my observation, can be excellent references for students who choose to live in IV. Such experiences all contribute to making me a qualified senator as I am more informed about various issues inside and outside the campus and have the skills to make changes.","The first bill is an Emergency Act that prepares funds and deals with issues including academic wellbeing, safety, housing, and dining under emergencies such as pandemics. Academically, the bill will cover courses, workloads, remote instruction procedures, and other aspects. It will inform the students in advance about the cancellation and addition of courses in response to emergencies, as well as guarantee the education quality by detailing online instruction processes and requirements (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous, course length, etc.). For safety concerns, the bill aims to implement emergency measures swiftly, such as providing masks and other protective equipment and relocating students to designated and separate dorms. For dining commons, the bill will set meal plans during special times for students living on campus and ensure that the staff is wearing masks and gloves. UCSB had responded to the above issues during Covid-19, but not on time and mainly still in an experiment to see what works and what does not. I believe after this time, we should be working on creating a systematic mechanism that deals specifically with these problems and making sure that next time we will not panic. The second resolution I will introduce is a comprehensive academic advising program that is exclusively dedicated to international students and students with English as an acquired language to check and revise their essays, resumes, and other writings. The current CLAS, in many students’ opinions, is not effectively helping the students I mentioned. Thus, the program is like a CLAS but specializes in mitigating the problems that some students face. I am also willing to participate in the program as an adviser. The third resolution would be a guidebook that guides students through Isla Vista house rentals. According to my knowledge, my students have been “tricked” by their landlords. For Instance, the landlords falsely accused students of damaging their properties. Thus, the guidebook can suggest that students should take pictures prior to moving in to make sure they have evidence. The example I mentioned is only one facet of the problems that students encounter, and the guidebook aims to combat such issues thoroughly.","My platform focuses mainly on academic wellbeing, safety, and convenience. Therefore, I would work with the Academic Senate, OISS, Public Safety Commission, A.S. Food Bank, IV Tenants Union, and other student bodies to achieve my goals while in office. Meanwhile, it is also essential to communicate with my constituents and other students.",See Above,"I will be holding online office hours every week to ensure thorough communications with students and my constituents. Students can contact me via Zoom, Messenger, Facebook, Instagram, and Wechat. I will also post updates and information on my FB page and Instagram. For international students, I also expect frequent communications via Wechat.","I am the best candidate for this position because of my leadership experience and unique background, which makes me a bridge that connects different student groups and serves them, respectively. Compared to other typical candidates, I am more likely to view and approach problems from various angles and better address the needs of particular students. Since I have experienced both Western and Eastern cultures, I believe I can make UCSB more diverse, harmonious, and globally influential.",(a) Left-leaning,"(c) Good. Although it is my first year at UCSB, I can still feel that the 70th A.S. Senate is doing well in addressing the needs of the student body. I am very glad that the A.S. Senate has passed the bill which aims to create two senate seats for international students. While still awaiting the final vote from UCSB students, this bill is a significant step towards a more diverse and global UCSB community.
","At this point, I have to admit that I currently hold no definite stance on BDS as I realize that dealing with such controversial topics requires professional knowledge on religions and cultures and experiences that are far beyond my reach. All I want to say is that we should always be respectful to each other and have productive conversations. I would need to gain a deeper understanding of this topic after discussing with my constituents and other professionals to make a fitting decision.","(b) No. Economically, it is quite impossible for a public university system like the UC to be tuition-free, but I believe that lowering the cost is feasible and necessary. I will be a strong advocate for alleviating financial burden for students.","I want to acknowledge the efforts the CAPS has put into combating mental health issues. However, a clear and present problem is that it has its limitations when it comes to international students and students of other backgrounds. Many of my international friends reflected that they never heard of the CAPS or that they don't think it is beneficial because of the language barrier and the cultural differences. Thus, I highly suggest that the CAPS reach out more to students of different backgrounds and make plans more suitable to them. After all, UCSB is a diverse and global community.","The university definitely could have handled the situation better as I have noticed that the notification to students on these assaults were often not on time. In addition to more timely notification, I believe that a text message-alarming system can be implemented to notify students immediately in such situations to enhance as much transparency as possible for safety concerns. Moreover, it is best to livestream the town halls to ensure that students who cannot make it are being updated.","Theoretically, I believe Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses, but the question is how to ensure that it is carried out thoroughly. Therefore, I think there is space to improve, and we should be aware that without proper education and awareness, a simple bill is not able to prevent all undesired conducts.","I am not able to speak for these groups, but from an outside perspective, I believe UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups since I am able to feel the tolerant atmosphere at the campus personally. However, outside the campus (like in IV and other places), students still face discrimination as some of my friends have told me that right now, during the harsh time of Covid-19, people were laughing at and insulting them because they were wearing masks and are Asians. Again, it is our responsibility to serve underrepresented groups not only inside the campus but also the entire community. I hope our university could help this by promoting awareness of the existence of various organizations and student bodies and encourage these groups to spread cultures and reduce discrimination.","The first bill I plan to author is undoubtedly an Emergency Act that prepares funds and specifies a set of measures to be taken under emergencies such as pandemics. At the very moment of the coronavirus outbreak, our campus was not ready to face the severity and abruptness. Thus, for a long while, students were living under the risk of being infected and did not know where to go. Students from foreign countries, although reluctant to return to their home countries, had to leave because they believed living in dorms were no longer safe due to the population density of rooms and dining halls. Moreover, certain classes were suddenly cancelled as UCSB switched to remote instruction, leading to problems of delayed majors, graduations, and below-requirement workloads. These are but not the only issues that the Act will deal with, and such a bill sets a remarkable cornerstone for ensuring safety and housing, academic wellbeing, and essential businesses of all students and faculties during an unprecedented crisis of this kind.","I would like to stress that the fact I, an international student, am running for senate demonstrates that A.S. is already becoming more accessible. As an international student that might be considered an atypical candidate, I believe that there should be more advertising (via youtube, email, fakebook pages, etc.) to especially international students. International students make up approximately 20% of this campus, and I believe that reaching out and making AS resources more accessible to international students especially, will make AS more accessible as a whole. It is essential to let students know that A.S. and the Student Senate can indeed make a difference on their life and the whole campus. I would also like to share my experience encouraging students of all backgrounds to participate.","The top priority should be establishing a fully coordinated and united UC system that deals with natural disasters/global emergencies and graduates pay wholeheartedly and effectively. The regents should look for a president who reflects values of equity in education and shows skills of adaptability to crises and the constantly evolving situations of students in the UC system. Most importantly, the president should open to students and actively listen to their concerns.",,,,,,,
Jackson Tofft,ev,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jackson-Tofft-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,3rd ,Political Science and Environmental Studies Double Major ,,,"I am running to be a senator in the 71st AS senate because I want to enact tangible change for the Isla Vista community and believe that I have the skills necessary to advocate for the needs of the student body. Though the AS senate has recently taken a number of significant steps to help the students of UCSB, I believe there is still a great deal of work that can be done and needs to be done. For nearly as long as I can remember, the power of those in public office to bring positive change to their constituents has captivated me. Likewise, one of my major goals starting in high school has been to advocate for the interests of my peers and to the best of my means bring about the changes that they wish to see and that would be most impactful to them. For this reason, along with many others, I am running to be a member of the 71st AS senate. I believe it is my duty to use the skills that I have to help my peers at UCSB and to ensure that the institution they are intrinsically linked to is doing everything it possibly can to ensure that their quality of life is as high as it can be.","Since spring quarter of my freshman year at UCSB I have been a member of the Zeta Kappa chapter of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and have held two executive committee positions. Being the risk manager and the vice president of the Zeta Kappa chapter has taught me a great deal about leadership and communication, and has given me the tools to be a successful and productive senator. Both of these positions have required me to coordinate with others and reach compromises between opposing viewpoints so as to take action that is satisfactory to every individual, regardless of their views. The inability to reach compromises between two opposing factions is a major contributor to political inaction at all levels and forms of democratic government. Likewise, I believe the ability to find a common ground that allows for action to be taken by a governing body is not only beneficial, but imperative for the attainment of the ultimate goal of any democratic governing body; positive change for the people it represents. I believe that my experiences as a leader in my fraternities chapter have greatly honed my ability to attain compromise, and that this ability will translate to my potential career as an AS senator.","The first bill I would write and introduce to the senate would create an ‘IVLandlords101’ resources packet and website with the sole purpose of better informing UCSB students living in Isla Vista of the ways they can hold their landlords accountable for unacceptable living conditions. In addition to educating student tenants about the ways they can hold landlords accountable, this virtual resource center would also explain legal jargon and technical stipulations commonly found in lease agreements so that student tenants are not compelled to sign an agreement that takes advantage of them just to have a place to live.

Another bill I plan to propose would increase the presence of the AS office of sustainability in Isla Vista to aid students living in Isla Vista in increasing their environmental consciousness and sustainable practices. Half of this bill would be educational, creating an outreach program to give students a clearer idea of the impact their daily practices have on the environment and easy ways they can reduce their carbon footprint and waste, and the other half would be tangible actions conducted in conjunction with the AS senate, the AS office of Sustainability and local governmental authorities. This tangible action portion would include constructing AS recycling bins like those found on campus in Isla Vista, and dispersing energy saving technologies like LED light bulbs and smart power strips to students living in Isla Vista to aid them in reducing their electricity usage which would have the dual effect of saving them money on electricity bills and reducing their carbon footprint.

Finally, I would propose a bill that would increase funding for the AS food bank for the purpose of creating a low-income food bank in Isla Vista. Though the AS food bank does much to address the problem of food insecurity in the UCSB community with their on campus location, I believe that they could do more by broadening their presence to include a food bank in Isla Vista. This would further the resources available to students that may be food insecure, and better encourage food insecure students who may see the on campus food bank as inconvenient to take advantage of the resources available to them.","The main premise of my platform is increasing the quality of life of UCSB students living in Isla Vista by any and all means available to the AS senate. This would be achieved through educational and active means. The educational being programs like a virtual tenant resource center to help student tenants in their negotiations with property management companies and landlords, and an outreach program to educate students on simple and cost effective ways they can save money on their electricity bills. The active means would entail programs like the dispersal of AS subsidized energy saving technologies to the Isla Vista community, initiatives in conjunction with local governing bodies to increase the maintenance and construction of sidewalks in Isla Vista, and the broadening of the AS food bank’s reach to include a location in Isla Vista. It is my belief that the best way to achieve these goals is to effectively communicate the tremendous benefit these programs would offer to students to the other members of the senate while being receptive to the criticisms they may offer. Many of the goals of my platform exist in some capacity already, however my plan is mainly to increase their scope and therefore the benefit they directly provide.","The main AS organizations I hope to work with to achieve the goals of my platform if elected include the Food Bank, Legal Resource Center, Environmental Affairs Board, Book Bank, and the Isla Vista Tenants Union. Non-AS entities I plan to work with to attain the goals of my platform include the Santa Barbara County Department of General Services, the Isla Vista Community Services district, the Office of the Third District supervisor, and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault. I believe that working with these organizations is imperative in attaining the goals of my platform because they have the practical experience and understanding of how to effectively induce change and implement the aspects of my platform in order to do the most good for the students of UCSB. With the assistance and consultation of these organizations, along with the constructive criticism of the AS senate, I believe the points of my platform have a tremendous potential to be implemented, and to enact tangible positive change for the UCSB students living in Isla Vista. No change on the scale envisioned by my platform is attainable by a single individual. Conversely, real change necessitates the contributions of numerous organizations and individuals within those organizations that care about making a positive impact.","Though the decision by UCSB to switch to exclusively virtual instruction for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year constitutes a communications challenge for representatives and their constituents, it also presents an opportunity for the implementation of creative and new means of communicating. Once elected to an AS off campus senate position, my first goal before introducing the bills I would propose would be to establish a means for my constituents to communicate with me that effectively addresses the circumstances of online instruction. This method would likely include posting zoom video chat links on my social media accounts where students could voice their concerns and ask questions once a week or potentially more often. Additionally, I would make my email easily available to my constituents so that students who wish to send more detailed and lengthy descriptions of their concerns and ideas could do so. In general, my goal regarding this topic is to provide my constituents with as many ways to contact me as possible, and ways that fit all student needs. In my opinion there is no substitute for in person contact with students. However, given the nature of the current circumstances and the necessity to protect public health in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, virtual methods of communication are imperative.","I believe the single most important characteristic of any elected official or public servant is a passion improving the quality of life of their constituents. Without this, there is no real driving force compelling a public servant to enact change and they essentially become talking heads who spew rhetoric without taking any real action. Additionally candidates for public office should ideally have great communication skills, a knack for finding a common ground between two opposing viewpoints, the ability to listen carefully and consistently and the courage to advocate for the needs of their constituents no matter the circumstances. With these qualifications in mind, I believe that I am the best candidate for off campus senator because I have made a concerted effort to foster the growth of my communication skills in all of my exploits, have learned how to attain compromise through my leadership experiences, and above all possess an undying passion to do good for people that both makes me an attentive and careful listener and gives me the courage to voice the needs of the people regardless of the personal consequences. The combination of all of these traits, both practiced and natural, truly set me apart from any other candidate. In essence, I believe I am the best candidate because I am not interested in the personal gain to be had from being an AS senator, but the power to enact change and better the lives of my peers that it bestows.",A. Left leaning,"I would assess the work of the 70th AS senate in addressing the needs of the student body as very good. They have taken measures to increase the access of the student body to mental health professionals, to implement low cost food options for low income individuals that may be in a state of food insecurity, and have taken action to lower the costs of mandatory academic materials such as textbooks. These three actions address what I believe to be three of the greatest problems affecting UCSB students; mental health, food insecurity, and academic costs. Having praised the steps taken by the 70th AS senate, I am in no way claiming that the work of the senate is complete, nor that there is no further room for improvement.","As an institution that claims to advocate for and promote human progress, it is imperative that UCSB give considerable thought to the actions of the companies it chooses to associate with and invest in. For the actions of those companies will ultimately reflect back upon UCSB. Having said that, at this time I am not adequately informed on what specific policies the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement advocates for, and consequently cannot endorse nor condemn a potential resolution regarding the matter. The most important action the senate can take on this matter is to listen carefully to the demands and beliefs of the students they represent so as to yield a resolution that best accommodates all students.","I do not believe UCSB should be completely tuition free, however I do believe that tuition costs should be substantially lowered and should be used more efficiently to ensure that students are more directly and positively impacted by their tuition payments. This would likely include a reallocation of funds from uses such as administration bonuses and incentives to other areas that would more directly benefit the students. Additionally, tuition should include the subsidy of textbooks, iclickers, online program fees, and other ‘hidden’ fees that so often bring unforeseen financial hardship upon UCSB students.","While I acknowledge that UCSB programs such as CAPS do provide a level of mental health resources to the student body, and have improved in recent years, calling them adequate would insinuate that there is no further room for growth which I do not believe. Mental health is one of the greatest challenges facing current and future UCSB students, and is constantly growing and evolving. By my estimation, one of the greatest obstacles facing students that may have mental health issues is finding the time to receive help within their incredibly busy academic schedules. Addressing this obstacle is the next step in improving the mental health services available to the student body and perhaps the most difficult to implement. While the online LiveHealth function of the CAPS website and the crisis phone line provide a high level of convenience to busy students that may be experiencing a mental health crisis, perhaps expanding the #saysomething program and the overall variety of programs available to students would further address the needs of students in need of different levels of care and with extremely busy schedules.","Situations like what occurred multiple times during fall quarter put the university in a difficult place because they have to primarily deliver justice for the victims of sexual misconduct, while ensuring that an impartial and fair investigation is conducted so as to provide due process to the accused. However, even given the difficulty of addressing the concerns of the campus community and providing an impartial and thorough investigation, it is my belief that there are a number of small and simple steps that could have been taken by the university that would have addressed the concerns and needs of the campus community much better than what occurred. First and foremost, the university refrained from the releasing the name(s) of the greek organizations that were under investigation and where the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place. Though publicizing the names of the organizations under title IX investigation would undoubtedly have impacted those organizations, providing that information to the student body is critical in my opinion. Simply providing the name of the organization where the sexual misconduct was alleged to have taken place would allow students to make better informed decisions about which organizations they associate with, and ultimately help them protect their safety in the future.","Title IX provides an adequate framework and set of ‘rules’ for the universities to refer to when addressing sexual assault. However, this set of framework and regulations governing the investigation process does not provide a specific timeline an investigation should follow. While it is incredibly important to ensure that due process is given to the accused, this lack of a stipulated timeline by title IX often causes investigations and grievance hearings to be drawn out for very long amounts of time. This bureaucratic inefficiency could be cause for survivors of sexual assault to be intimidated by the entire process, having to manage their daily responsibilities in addition to a title IX procedure, and to perhaps be less inclined to report sexual misconduct. This is a massive problem, as it is the duty of the UC system and any public institution of higher education to ensure that a safe environment is created for all students, and that they will act to bring justice to perpetrators of sexual misconduct. Therefore, it is my belief that UCSB’s title IX protocol should be amended so as to make the process as streamlined and swift as possible while still ensuring due process is given to both sides.","Not being a member of one of these historically oppressed groups myself, I feel I am unqualified to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of UCSB’s programs designed to help these groups. Likewise, it is imperative for the senate to listen carefully to the criticisms of the programs provided by UCSB that may be offered by individuals or organizations representing these groups. However, as I stated in my response to the question of the adequacy of UCSB’s mental health services, I believe that the term ‘adequate’ implies that no further progress is necessary. Therefore, in the case of UCSB’s assistance and service to historically oppressed groups on campus, I believe there is always room for improvement. It is my belief that programs offered by campus organizations like the MCC should be expanded and publicized more to the campus community. Requiring that students take classes that discuss the history of these oppressed groups in order to graduate (such as the ethnicity requirement) is valuable and necessary to inform the student population of the struggles these groups have endured in the past and continue to endure today. Increasing student participation and interest in events put on by the MCC would further this goal, and better inform students about the struggles of oppressed groups and what they can do in their daily lives to show solidarity and support to these groups.","The first bill I will author as a member of the AS senate will allocate a reasonable amount of funding to increase the amount of resources available to students living in Isla Vista regarding interactions with property management companies and landlords. Too many students in our community sign lease agreements that may take advantage of them without fully understanding the stipulations and legal jargon in the agreements. Furthermore, too many students living in Isla Vista suffer through sub-par living conditions with no real way to hold their property management companies or landlords accountable for the conditions of their residences. This bill would create a ‘checklist’ that students could refer to before signing a lease to identify in more understandable terms common stipulations in lease agreements that may have a negative impact on them in the future. Additionally, the bill would create a ‘landlord101’ informational website and set of brochures/packets that would seek to inform students in Isla Vista of their rights as a tenant, and the ways they can hold their landlords accountable for their living conditions.","It is no secret that the primary means students receive information in the modern era is through social media. Likewise, I would propose the creation of a UCSB AS senate social media account to be implemented on all major social media platforms with the purposes of providing detailed accounts of what goes on at every meeting, and outreach to students using polls and other methods to gauge the interests of the student body. Though the AS senate facebook page provides students with a means of live streaming senate meetings, it is my belief that the AS Senate should expand its social media presence to all major social media platforms to further increase the amount of transparency present for students. These accounts would make live streams of senate meetings available to a larger portion of the student body, provide links to bills and resolutions that are passed to provide increased transparency to students, and utilize polls to better gauge the student body’s attitudes and opinions towards the agenda of the senate and the resolutions they may pass. Creating social media accounts such as these for the AS senate would greatly help to bridge the gap between the students and their elected representatives, and overall make the duties and processes of the senate more accessible to students.","The two top priorities for the next UC president in my opinion are implementing a cost of living adjustment for graduate students, and lowering undergraduate tuition costs. Both of these issues are incredibly important for the UC system to address in the coming years. As the cost of living has increased for the past four decades, wages have stagnated and not proportionally increased. UC tuition costs have also continuously increased over this same time span. In order to serve justice to the graduate and undergraduate students that are the lifeblood of the UC system, a cost of living adjustment must be implemented for graduate students, and undergraduate tuition rates must be lowered or at least utilized by the university more efficiently so as to provide greater tangible benefits to students. It is the duty of the UC system to strive to attain these goals, and benefit their students in any and every way that they can.",,,,,,,

I believe I am well-equipped to do that. I want to make sure all groups within our diverse community at UCSB are represented because I want to serve every Gaucho. I love our community, as it is filled with wonderful people that have accepted me with open arms and I believe it is my duty to give back and serve my community as best as I can. It is my goal to make positive changes for the current and future members of UCSB.","Being a part of Greek life, I’ve had the opportunity to hear about so many different experiences and involvements from members within my fraternity and it has inspired me to seek a leadership role on campus! ​I have developed my necessary academic skills in my first year, and am now ready to move on to leadership positions like in high school.​ I have many leadership positions from high school that have prepared me to be a senator such as being the Director of Activities, which taught me a lot about being the liaison between the student body and administrative board and expressing the entire student voice. There, I worked on a team of other AS students and made sure to make positive changes in our high school and represent the student body, a skill I plan on transitioning to the 71st senate.","While in office, the three bills or resolutions I would like to introduce would be tenant resources for the residence of Isla Vista, increasing study spaces off-campus, and improving local environmental sustainability practices. More precisely, I would want to provide residents of Isla Vista with an abundance of information educating them on their tenant’s rights along with ways to decrease tenant-landlord conflict. I want to make sure that students aren’t getting taken advantage of by management companies and leases. With this resolution, I also hope to provide ways in which tenants can hold their landlords more accountable and I hope to work with organizations like Isla Vista Tenants Union in order to provide residents of Isla Vista the most support possible. In regards to increasing study spaces off-campus, I would like to pass a bill that would allow students who live in Isla Vista to have more conveniently placed study spaces located off-campus so that they have more accessibility to have places to go do work in. In regards to the improvement of local environmental sustainability, I would like to introduce a bill to inspire environmental consciousness to Isla Vista residents along with ways to improve and innovate the local recycling and composting system. I would like to work with local environmental organizations in order to properly enact this bill.","My platform revolves around community improvement and efficiency. I want to make sure I improve UCSBs community as best as possible to ensure everyone is benefiting. As mentioned earlier, I would like to introduce bills and resolutions, such as tenant resources for the residents of Isla Vista, increasing study spaces off-campus, and improving local environmental sustainability practices, and hope to work with local organizations to ensure efficiency with these ideas. Other main points on my platform would be to implement a rental system in the library where students can borrow laptop and/or phone chargers, expand blue light systems into Isla Vista along with lighting expansion projects in order to increase the safety of community residents, provide residents of Isla Vista with consistent and easy training on Naloxone, a nasal spray that can save the lives of people who have overdosed, and increase the amount of school supplies, such as Scantrons, that can be bought in stores off-campus. I hope to work with AS along with the library in order to create an effective and efficient rental system for device charging supplies so that students can always have the resources they need while studying in the library– something especially useful during midterms and finals. In regards to expanding the blue light system and lighting expansion projects in Isla Vista, I plan on working with IVTU, IVCSD, and EVPLA in order to make these improvements happen. I also plan to continue to work with The Student Health/Alcohol & Drug Program to sustain and improve the Naloxone training to ensure students are well equipped to prevent a drug overdose, hoping to save many lives. Finally, I will try to work with local stores in Isla Vista in order to increase the number of school supplies sold in order for students to have convenient locations to purchase items, such as Blue Books and Scantrons, on their way to class as they leave their residence located off-campus. My platform is focused on delivering methods to improve the college experience for all students with the hopes of making long-lasting impacts!","I would like to work with Isla Vista Tenants Union in order to provide residents of Isla Vista sufficient information educating them on their tenants rights to ensure that they don’t get taken advantage from by their leasing companies. I also hope to work with organizations like IVTU, IVCSD, and EVPLA in order to expand the blue light system and lighting expansion projects in Isla Vista. In regards to inspiring environmental consciousness in residents of Isla Vista along with the improvement of local recycling and compost systems, I plan on working with organizations like Refuse, Recycling, and Research Center (R3C) and Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) in order to effectively achieve this aspect of my platform. Another organization that I plan on working with is The Student Health/Alcohol & Drug Program to sustain and improve the Naloxone training. These are just a handful of the many organizations I plan on working with. I am also open to hearing my constituents if they have any suggested organizations that I should work with.","If online courses continue through the summer and fall quarter, then I will make sure I am always available to my constituents because I want to make sure I can address their needs and be an available outlet for them to seek. For example, I will plan weekly ZOOM office hours and will also be willing to schedule personal appointments. I would also post as much information as possible on social media platforms to be as transparent as I can be and allow users to interact with me through that medium. I will also post all of my contact information such as cell phone numbers and email just in case constituents want to reach out to me in that way. I will also post a Google form so that students can add comments or questions there too. Ultimate availability is one of my main goals so that everyone can reach out to me. I am also willing to communicate through other mediums if my constituents give me any suggestions because I want to be flexible in order to address them.
","There are many reasons as to why I believe I am the best candidate for this position, such as my compassion, drive, and eagerness to make positive changes. However, the most important reason as to why I would make the best candidate for this position is that I will make sure to address the needs of my constituents and voice all of their opinions as best as possible. I will always put their needs first. I have an organized and driven work ethic that is dependable. I have specific and tangible plans and ideas on how to make positive improvements. I have a strong familiarity with Legal Code and I am always open to hearing varying ideas on different issues and ways to address them. Another important trait that senators need is the capability to work in teams, and since I would be working with multiple other senators and executive board members, I believe I have strong communication skills in order to work in an efficient group due to past teamwork experiences that I have. For reasons like this and many more, I believe I am more than well-equipped to be your next off-campus senator!",(a) Left-leaning,"(b) Very Good. I believe the 70th A.S. Senate has done a very good job of addressing the needs of the student body. With such a dedicated and motivated group of students driven to make positive changes, the student body had a great group of students making sure the needs of the student body were being addressed. The 70th A.S. Senate was a very cohesive group of leaders who served as great liaisons for BCUs.","I would have to hear with my constituents before I gauge my opinion on this topic. In order to confidently vote on the best option, I would need to hear from students from all sides of this debate as their input is valuable to my decision. I am here to serve my constituents, and I need to take into consideration their opinions before I decide.","Ideally, I would love for our education here at UCSB to be free. However, due to the systems in place, the way our economy works and all, the education we currently receive along with all of the resources would not be made possible without the tuition students pay. I do believe however that the fees students pay should be allocated fairly and there should be a stronger push to lower student fees for low-income backgrounds. I understand tuition is necessary to support the resources we receive, but we should try to alleviate the costs wherever they can be.","I do believe the mental health services at UCSB are satisfactory for some students. There are many programs and organizations on campus that aid students with mental health issues. There are services like CAPS, The Mental Health Town Hall, and UCSB CARE and many others that are all great resources for students to use. However, the circulation of said resources could be improved. A lot of students that attend UCSB are unaware of these services and the benefits that they provide and I believe a great way to improve these resources would be to increase the circulation of knowledge about these programs to students so that they can be more aware of the great benefits that they provide. There is one problem I’d like to address, and that would be the lack of funds that these programs and organizations get. I would like to strategize a way for these services to be given the adequate funds necessary in order for them to function as best as possible. Overall, the mental health services serve the student body adequately, but no system is perfect and there is always room for improvement.","I believe the university tried with great effort to address this situation correctly, but there could have definitely been a more adequate way in addressing these concerns as many students felt that the university wasn’t doing enough. To start off, the university was slow in responding to these issues and a faster job could have been done. Also, the information that the university provided students in regards to these reports were very vague which confused many students. However, once the university got in-control, they started to resolve some, not all, of the issues, such as creating the UCSB Safer Social Events Taskforce where the Inter Fraternal Council (IFC) established new social practices that would increase safety during fraternal events. Along with that, they also put fraternities on social moratorium as they tried to resolve more of these issues. Overall, efforts were made by the university to address these issues, but there were a number of ways in which they could have handled the situation better.","Title IX encompasses a great idea with a great system in mind to address sexual assault, but there are a couple of ways in which it could be more adequate in order to protect all students of the university. Title IX fails to support the safety of our Isla Vista community, as their rules apply to university-owned buildings and spaces, but many students live off-campus and it is the University’s job to protect all students regardless of where they live.","As a member of a historically underrepresented group, I believe that UCSB is trying to serve historically underrepresented groups, including members of the Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+ community and others, but they need to do more. To start off, the SRB has a handful of cultural resource centers such as the African Diasporic Cultural Resource Center (AdCRC), Asian Resource Center (ARC), and Middle Eastern Resource Center (MERC) just to name a few. All of these resources are there for underrepresented groups to make use of in order to benefit their needs, which is an effective way that UCSB tries to serve these historically underrepresented groups. Along with this, there are a bunch of clubs on campus that people from these underrepresented groups can be a part of in order to enrich their college experience. However, these resource centers and clubs could benefit from greater funding, which would be a more effective way in which UCSB could better serve these groups. There is always more work to be done!","If I am elected to serve on the Senate, the first bill I plan to author would either be a bill that would increase the number of study spaces available to students off-campus so that they have a more convenient location to study or a bill that would reform and improve both the recycling and composting systems in and around Isla Vista in order for us to preserve and protect our local environment.","As a senator, I would work to involve the student body more and keep them informed about what the Senate is doing by providing our community with a variety of information such as through social media, schoolwide sent emails, pamphlets, advertisements near the arbor, advertisements across Isla Vista, and through online streaming like ZOOM. By doing so, students could be more aware of the changes that are being made along with information on how they could make a change too. Also, I believe that open forums would be a great way for students to input their opinions along with open discussions that would allow for a diverse standpoint on issues. As a senator, I would also make myself approachable and as available as possible in order for me to serve my community and their needs. It is my goal to reach out to as many students as possible and serve them.","One of the top priorities for the next UC President would be to implement ways that would address times of crises and establish well-formed procedures and programs that would help students out during these events. There have been many catastrophic events in recent years, such as fires and the current Coronavirus, both of which have caused many students to evacuate their residencies near or on campus. The next UC President should prioritize procedures that will ensure all students with the resources needed in order to cope with such crises so that they aren’t put in harm’s way and are able to adequately adjust to such drastic changes. The next UC President must also address the COLA movement because graduate students are valuable to our institution and they need to be supported.",,,,,,,

I feel as though I have a responsibility to advocate for all students, hear their concerns, and do something about it. I care about UCSB, the community and its constituents; I am invested in the outcomes this university creates for me and others. Additionally, the people I’ve met through this whole process are some of the most amazing humans. They are motivated, driven, passionate, intelligent, and so incredibly compassionate. Being a part of the senate would allow me to get to know more like-minded individuals that inspire and motivate me to be the best I can be. I would be able to gain valuable leadership skills, while helping the student body. By being elected an off-campus senator, I would be given a great opportunity to improve Isla Vista, the lives and experiences of those living there, and leave a lasting impact on a university that has shaped who I am today.","I have been involved with a multitude of different organizations and groups on- and off-campus in my two years at UCSB. During my first year, I was able to represent the Asian and Pacific Islanders Honors floor as a floor representative in Anacapa Hall, which provided me with valuable leadership and teamwork experience, as well as knowledge on how to implement programs and effectively budget for them. Additionally, I am a part of Delta Gamma Panhellenic Sorority, where I have held the position of Director of Intra-Fraternal Affairs; this position allowed me to facilitate communication between my sorority for volunteer opportunities and philanthropy events. Furthermore, I currently work for the Orfalea Children’s Center, the on-campus daycare, as an office assistant and as a notetaker and exam proctor for the Disabled Students Program. These have allowed me to interact with a variety of students I would normally not have been able to. Lastly, I’ve been able to give back to the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara community as I currently volunteer with Friendship Manor, a retirement home in Isla Vista, as well as Direct Relief. This is a non-profit humanitarian aid organization that provides medical supplies and emergency kits to crises and disasters around the globe. Their work is especially important during this on-going pandemic.","The first bill that I would like to introduce while in office is to expand upon the work of President Alison Sir by implementing another Mental Health Town Hall, as well as circulating greater information about the mental health programs, resources and facilities provided for students in Isla Vista. Additionally, the second bill I would like to introduce would be to create a comprehensive and accessible website or app for those that own animals in Isla Vista to find good quality and affordable vet care, pet stores, pet-walking services, etc. To build off of that, I would like to set aside funding to have our own pet vaccination drive where once a quarter, pet owners are able to have their animals vaccinated for an affordable price. This would allow those
who don’t have cars the vet care their animals need. One other component would be to create a low-cost animal training service in Isla Vista. The last part of that bill would be to create a group that would keep the animal parks clean in Isla Vista. The third and last bill I would like to introduce while in office would be to increase the level of sustainability in the Isla Vista
community by providing more compost bins and sites.","My platforms aim to advocate for a diverse student body, improve the level of sustainability, and inform the constituents of Isla Vista of the various resources provided on issues like food insecurity, the legal process of battling with bad landlords, mental health programs, as well as others. Additionally, I want to create new programs like a Rate-My-Landlord app, an AS Food Bank in Isla Vista, a pet vaccination drive and animal training service. I will tirelessly work to achieve these goals because I feel they are important to the needs of the student body. By writing legislation and allocating Associated Students funds, I will be able to build off the work of the 70th Senate and work with a variety of organizations that are already contributing to this effort to improve the lives and experiences of students living in Isla Vista.","In order to improve the level of sustainability in the Isla Vista community, I hope to work with the Isla Vista Compost Collective in order to provide a greater number of compost bins. Additionally, I’d like to work with the AS Recycling and Zero Waste Committee to increase Isla Vista’s waste management and create stricter guidelines on recycling in IV. Furthermore, it’s necessary for me to work with the Isla Vista Tenants Union in order to transmit information about the legal process of battling your landlord. During this pandemic, students must be aware of the resources that IVTU and AS can provide for students who can no longer pay their rent, must break their leases, and what that process entails. Furthermore, in order to address mental health, I would like to work with the UCSB Mental Health Task Force to see how we can disseminate the information on those resources and where we can improve the efficiency of CAPS. Presidential candidate Daevionne Beasley wants to create an app for CAPS on waiting times to improve efficiency, so I would really enjoy working with him on that project as well.","I will make myself available to my constituents during my term if the shift to online courses
continues through summer and fall quarter by posting a zoom link once a week on all of my
social media platforms as a way for constituents to reach out and voice their concerns. It would
take the place of my office hours. Additionally, if students want to privately speak with me, they
can email me for a private zoom meeting or phone call at a designated time and day. Considering online classes create very open schedules, I will be able to be extremely flexible in scheduling and be openly available for any and all of my constituents.","I’m the best candidate for this position because I am motivated and driven to make UCSB and Isla Vista the best school to go to and the best place to live. I want to advocate and improve upon
the student body’s experience as a whole. Additionally, this opportunity would allow for exponential growth in my leadership abilities, while also being a valuable asset to students at the same time. I bring these experiences: my foundational leadership experience as Director of Intra-fraternal Affairs for the Delta Gamma sorority and as a floor representative for the Asian and Pacific Islander Honor’s floor in Anacapa, my community outreach through volunteering for Direct Relief and Friendship Manor, and my involvement in the Orfalea Children’s Center as an office assistant and the Disabled Students Program as an exam proctor and notetaker. Overall, my leadership style as an off-campus senator would be one of compassion, empathy, and drive.
Through my experiences in different organizations across the UCSB campus, I feel as though I can reach a lot of people and make a difference in their lives.",(a) Left-leaning,"(a) Excellent: The work of the 70th A.S. Senate was excellent in addressing the needs of the student body. Not only did they create two international senator positions, which in turn increased the level of inclusion and representation at UCSB, they detoxified the A.S. Senate environment and passed a resolution supporting our grad students and COLA.","(b) No: At UCSB, the topic of divestment is a very controversial and personal topic to many. It is a very nuanced issue with lots of different points of views, leading to very heated discussions on whether to vote in favor of its resolution. I, personally, am not very educated on the issue, but I would love to learn and hear more about it from both sides of the issue. There is a lack of knowledge on this topic and the BDS movement that needs to be increased and talked about more.","(b) No: As a large university with a large and diverse student population, the money accumulated
through tuition fees helps accommodate students of differing socioeconomic backgrounds by
providing necessary resources and programs for students. However, if the price can be lowered
while still providing these valuable resources, that would be incredibly beneficial for the entire
student body and allow more students to attend this university.","I believe the mental health services at UCSB are adequate and that there are a lot of services
available to students, if they know where to look. With that being said, many students don’t
know how to navigate these resources. Therefore, I think we need to increase the circulation
of this knowledge. The Mental Health Town Hall was a great step forward in disseminating
information, but it’s just not well-known. This should be expanded upon. On campus, CAPS
is a great resource. But the wait times are a huge inconvenience to students and if a student
needs counseling, they may only be able to get one appointment per month. They do
collaborate with community mental health facilities and students can receive referrals to
them. Presidential candidate, Daevionne Beasley, wants to create an app for the waiting lines
at CAPS to increase efficiency for students. Furthermore, the CAPS program also has mental
health peers who are more readily available than the therapists. The UCSB Health and
Wellness program provides lots of tips and puts on events/programs meant to educate on
reducing stressors. Additionally, the UCSB CARE office provides confidential support and
advocacy to students who have experienced sexual assault, relationship abuse, and stalking.
Overall, there are a variety of programs, but there needs to be greater circulation of how to
tap into these resources and more efficiency with the CAPS program.","I believe the university most definitely could have handled the situation faster, but did the best they could under unfounded circumstances. Students received very dispersed vague information about the situation, leaving more students confused than comforted. However, once the university got on top of things, they put together a Task Force co-chaired by AS President, Alison Sir with membership from the UCSB and Isla Vista communities to improve the safety of others at social events. They met with the Interfraternity Council (IFC), who in turn put in place a social moratorium to take time to put in place safe social and preventive practices. Additionally, there was a SASA Sexual Assault Town Hall to create a space for everyone to voice their concerns. These changes have stuck and are in place today. Therefore, while the initial response was slow and I’d like to see that improved upon, as a Greek-affiliated student, I appreciated the response the university did eventually come up with.","I believe that Title IX, as an idea, is a great system to address sexual assault on UC
campuses. However, there are substantial problems with the system. There has been an
increase in lawsuits, stating that colleges have mishandled students’ sexual assault cases.
To battle that, the U.S. Department of Education will soon release new regulations
around Title IX to provide greater protection for students. When this happens, Title IX
will be a more fair and adequate system to address sexual assault and the implications of
it. Furthermore, located within the Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office are
resources for students to get guidance about their violent sexual encounter, including
CAPS, CARE, ASAP, and Office of the Ombuds. As a senator, I would love to be an
advocate for these students and continue to expand the resources for these afflicted
students.","I am not a member of one of these historically underrepresented groups, including members of
the Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+ community and others so I cannot speak on their experiences they
have had at UCSB thus far. However, I would certainly be open to hearing from these groups to
better serve them in their education.","The first bill or resolution that I would author would be to create a comprehensive and accessible website or app for those that own animals in Isla Vista to find good quality and affordable vet care, pet stores, training services, pet-walking services, etc. There are many students in Isla Vista that own emotional support animals, assistance animals for students with disabilities, or just pets owned by students in Isla Vista. Many students feel that Isla Vista is not a great place to own animals, despite many of them needing animals as personal therapy. To build off of that, I would like to set aside funding to have our own pet vaccination drive where once a quarter, pet owners are able to have their animals vaccinated for a low and affordable price. This would allow those who don’t have cars the vet care their animals need. Additionally, many animals in Isla Vista are not well-trained and attack other animals, creating expensive vet bills college students just can’t afford. Therefore, I’d like to introduce a low-cost training program to Isla Vista to create a better life for those animals, and in turn people, living in Isla Vista. The last component of this bill would be to establish a group that will help maintain the pet parks in IV.","As a senator, I would work to involve the student body more by letting the
community of students I am surrounded with know that they can reach out to me if
they have any issue with the university. By being as approachable as possible, as well
as vocal about wanting others to come to me, I believe I can reach some students that
normally would not know anything about how to make active change within UCSB.
Additionally, by increasing the amount of unique advertising in a variety of ways
(social media, pamphlets, email, posters, newsletters, etc.), more students can be
notified of the large amount of programs UCSB has to offer. In particular, President
Alison Sir’s project of making an AS app is a step in the right direction as students
are on their phones the majority of the day anyway. This app details the ongoings of
AS meetings and the agenda. This way, more students are aware and informed of
what the Senate is doing or addressing, as well as encouraged to come forward and
voice their concerns.","The top priorities for the next UC President will be how to address crises and emergency situations and have procedures, resources and programs in place to help students; this is especially important as fires, mudslides and the coronavirus have wreaked havoc on California and the nation. Additional procedures should include better preparing educators on how to educate online, just in case such an event were to happen again. Furthermore, Janet Napolitano has received a lot of backlash in regards to how the UC systems have treated their Teacher Assistants/Grad Students and the COLA movement. This new president needs to be more open to student dialogue and feedback and come prepared to compromise with the TAs. Other important priorities would be to continue to make UC campuses as sustainable as possible and make college more affordable.",,,,,,,
Cameron Parker,arturo,Off Campus Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cameron-Parker-Off-Campus-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,1st,Political Science,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 71st senate because I want to do as much as I can to
improve our incredible campus. I consider myself extremely lucky to go to such an amazing
school, but I also recognize many parts of our campus and its inner workings that could be
improved to students’ benefit. My main priorities include student involvement, representation,
and understanding. As a campus with one of the highest rates of voter registration and turnout, I
would love to prioritize providing students with access to information relating to modern politics.
I intend on developing an organization and workshops to contribute to this effort, committed
entirely to simplifying political issues relevant to upcoming elections. In reference to
representation, I intend on fighting for a Senate position designated for a student in Greek Life so
a large part of our campus community can directly represent themselves, especially considering
the recent issues involving Greek life at UCSB. I am running to be a senator with the 71st senate
because I believe I can make a positive difference here -- I believe I can contribute to the
betterment of this campus and improve the experiences of the students that attend it.","As a current fellow for Senator Giselle Etessami, I have attended several Senate meetings and
become familiar with the organization and function of the Senate , as well as assisted on a variety
of the senator’s projects. Although this may be more direct, I believe my most valuable
experience on campus that has prepared me to be a senator has been my time on Hall Council in
Santa Cruz Hall. I was chosen to be the Real Talk Facilitator. Throughout this role, I was lucky
enough to be able to facilitate discussions surrounding ideas from polarizing social justice issues
to mental health, giving students a safe space to share their ideas. I led discussions on
institutional racism, COLA, consent, mental health, and more -- all of which provided me with a
unique perspective going into a senate position, because I have spoken directly with so many
students about their personal experiences and issues both on campus and on a much larger scale.
I believe that my personal, direct experience with senatorial affairs is very valuable. However, I
think it is incomparable to my experience with the student body. I consider myself very lucky to

know so many of my peers so well, and to have discussed so much with them, and I would
certainly carry over that compassion, empathy, and action into the senate.","My greatest goal during my time in the senate will be to develop an organization dedicated to
explaining the most complex of political issues in simple terms to the general student population,
so come every election, every UCSB student is as well-informed and prepared to vote as
possible. The group would develop non-partisan explanations of the issues -- it would never
misconstrue an issue to skew UCSB students in one political direction or another, and these
issues would be compiled both onto a site and into live, in-person workshops before elections so
students have access to that information.
Another goal I hope to achieve is creating a Greek Life Senator position. Currently, all of Greek
Life is represented by Off-Campus Senators. I intend on creating a Greek Life senator position so
that a very large part of our campus community can represent themselves directly, rather than
especially considering recent conflicts with Greek life on our campus.
I also want to begin action on the development of more off-campus study space. With such a
high number of our students living in IV, I think an off-campus annex or library would be
extremely beneficial. An off-campus UCSB library or annex would provide students with easier
access to the resources available on campus, and would certainly limit the extreme overcrowding
in the library during dead and finals weeks.","My platform is based on student representation, understanding, and involvement. In order to
have as much of our student population as represented as possible, I intend on introducing a
Greek Life Senator position. Greek life is currently represented by Off-Campus senators, and
while those senators can sometimes be involved in Greek Life, I think it would be extremely
beneficial to have a position designated specifically for that part of our campus community.
Especially considering recent issues involving Greek life on our campus, I think more direct
representation is extremely necessary.
Additionally, my main priority surrounding student understanding and involvement relates to
political awareness. UCSB consistently has one of the highest voter registration and turnout rates
in the nation -- so, to make this as effective as possible, I think our students should be as
informed as possible. I want to create an organization on campus dedicated exclusively to
explaining the most complex of political issues in simple, non-partisan terms, so every student

voter on our campus can be as informed as possible going into election seasons. I intend on
having this organization spread this information through both a site and various workshops
throughout election years, so all students can be well-informed voters regardless of major.","In reference to my platform surrounding the support of students that are new to finding housing
off campus, I want to collaborate with the IV Tenants Union to continue developing a “Rate my
Landlord” or “Rate my Housing” system. As a first year that is living off campus next year, I can
speak from experience -- the housing process for students that are brand new to finding housing
for themselves can be extremely stressful, especially factoring in budget, relationships with
landlords, location, and more.
In reference to my platform surrounding the creation of a Greek Life Senator position, I would
love to communicate with leaders within Greek life, so I can be as informed as possible on what
they believe to be best for them in terms of their representation within Associated Students.
Currently, Greek Life is included in the constituency of Off-Campus senators -- but they make
up such a large portion of the student population (11%) that I feel they are more than entitled to
their own specific Senator position. Especially considering the recent issues with Greek life on
our campus, I think it is extremely important for Greek life to be able to represent themselves as
directly as possible.","This is an extremely trying time for students, and it is very new to all of us -- if it were to
continue into my term, I would do everything I can to make myself available to my constituents.
I would certainly hold weekly Zoom office hours so my constituents can speak to me directly
during scheduled hours, and I would also be more than willing to make appointments with
students that cannot attend those drop-in hours -- I’m sure schedules for students are extremely
hectic with this transition to online courses, and I am more than willing to adapt to the needs of
my constituents. Furthermore, I would be very active on all of my Senator and personal social
media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and I am completely comfortable
with having my constituents reach out to me on those platforms as well. In reference to
Instagram, I would also certainly be willing to host scheduled Instagram Lives so my
constituents can access me in that way as well -- then I would be able to answer questions from
constituents to a larger audience, so all that are seeking a response to the same question can see it
in saved Instagram Live sessions.","More than anything, I am committed to supporting and uplifting my peers to the best of my
ability. That is how I spent my entire high school career, and that is what I will prioritize as a
senator here. I dedicated all of my spare time in high school to developing the I Am AP program,
creating a support system for AP and Honors students on my campus through peer to peer
tutoring, mentorship, and support. During my first year at UCSB, I was chosen to be the Real
Talk Facilitator within Santa Cruz Hall’s Hall Council -- this role was extremely valuable to me
because I got to lead discussions on social justice and student issues, focusing on healthy debate
and sharing without fear of being looked down upon for one’s opinions. Additionally, as a fellow
for current Senator Giselle Etessami, I have experience in attending Senate meetings and in
assisting with the development of projects and legislation. I am the best candidate for this
position because my priority is my fellow students. I am committed to representing my
constituents as accurately and persistently as possible, and I will fight endlessly to keep my
constituents informed, well-represented, and cared for.",(a) Left-leaning,"(b) Very Good; I think the current AS Senate has done very well in addressing the needs of the student body.
I was very glad to see the intended addition of an International Student Senator, so more of
our student body can be represented. Additionally, I am very proud of our 70th senate for
consistently supporting the COLA movement and our graduate students.","Personally, I do not think I have been educated enough on either side of this issue to
have developed an educated opinion. This is an issue that I intend to inform myself on
much more in the future, but I do not currently feel as though I am qualified to claim
identification with one side or the other. As I become more informed, I will be certain
to make my stance clear.","(a) Yes: I believe that this country should be working toward making all public universities tuition-free.
We no longer live in a world where 12 years of education is enough to be hired -- but higher
education is not nearly as accessible as it needs to be if we are to keep our workforce as educated
and qualified as modern society requires. So, in conclusion, the UC, as an advanced public
university system, should lead the movement toward free public university tuition nationwide.","Mental health services at UCSB are far from adequate. As someone who has gone to therapy
for the last several years, I can certainly speak to its value and impact when attended
regularly and consistently -- but this is next to impossible to achieve at UCSB. Personally, I
have been unable to get more than one appointment every two months at CAPS -- this is
entirely unacceptable. I am lucky that my last few years of my mental health journey have
been extremely progressive, so I no longer require access as often as I used to -- but my
experience is not that of the majority. Speaking from experience, a student experiencing
mental health issues cannot get the benefit they need from one or two sessions every two
months. A few years ago, I had crippling social anxiety and severe depression disorders, and
if it had not been for weekly therapy, I would not have had access to the positive
reinforcement and coping techniques that so drastically improved my mental health. We have
to increase access to the mental health resources we have so they can actually make the
impact they are intended to make.","I believe the university should have done much more. I don’t consider their enforcement of
social probation as a response to the problem -- it was a way to avoid directly addressing it.
Rather than having us retake a GauchoFYI course on consent and placing fraternities on
social probation, the university should have gotten directly involved in terms of a response. I
certainly recognize the beneficial aspects of Greek life and their philanthropy and I do not
demonize the organization for the actions of certain members, but more action needs to be
taken in response to the development of a dangerous culture within certain houses. The
university needs to be direct with its student population in reference to the issues that have
arisen on some fraternity properties -- it is their responsibility to maintain the safety of their
students, and if they are unwilling to address the problem as more than just something that
happens when students “choose to party”, they are complicit in the assaults that will continue
to occur.","Title IX is not an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Title IX only
protects students who think they will be believed if they report. Given the response of UCSB
in particular to the reports of sexual assault during Fall Quarter of 2019, it is reasonable to
assume that many women, myself included, are not confident in the abilities or willingness of
the university to take such allegations as seriously as they should. Because of that lack of
confidence, many women may be worried about the backlash of reporting, reliving trauma
while reporting, and the failure of the on-campus system to support them. The clauses of
Title IX itself are extremely supportive of students in reference to what is required of a
campus, but if students do not feel supported by their school in the first place, the protective
clauses embedded into the law are futile. So, while Title IX certainly helps sexual assault and
harassment survivors, it is imperative that the UC campuses take clear, direct, and public
action when reports are made to make their students confident in their school’s support for
them.","I certainly would never speak on behalf of underrepresented groups that I am not a part of --
while I do my best to be aware of and understanding of the experiences of many
underrepresented groups, I know that I will never be able to truly understand the experiences of
them. However, despite that, I will do my absolute best to reach out while I am in office so I can
represent them as well and accurately as possible. Now, in reference to UCSB, I do not believe
our campus is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups. Students are supporting
each other for more than the campus is supporting them -- the overwhelming majority of groups
formed to represent racial or ethnic backgrounds and the LGBTQ+ community have been formed
by and are made up of students. The campus itself is not necessarily supporting that community -
- that community has created a home for itself on campus. As admirable as that is, the campus
should certainly be doing more to support these students. UCSB should be promoting more
inclusive and supportive events on campus, so students in underrepresented or underprivileged
groups can feel more at home and more understood by the campus they attend.","If I am elected to serve on the Senate, the first bill I would plan to author is the creation of a
Greek Life senator position. Personally, I am not involved in Greek life -- it is because of this
that I believe a Greek Life senator should exist. As an off-campus senator, Greek Life is included
in my constituency -- while I am certainly willing to do as much as I can to work with Greek life
so I can represent them as well as all of my other off-campus constituents, I believe they deserve
a position of their own so they can be represented as well and as directly as possible. Especially

considering the recent issues involving Greek life on our campus in Fall of 2019, direct and clear
representation is more important than ever -- and Greek life should be present to both to respond
to these issues and to contribute to the betterment of the off-campus community through
participation in the AS Senate.","As a senator, I will work to keep the student body informed on what is going on in Associated
Students through a combination of spreading information on social media and working on the
possibility of creating AS workshops and info sessions. I would place an emphasis on the value
of my constituents’ opinions so I can hear from as many of them as possible, and I would
promote any upcoming AS events or AS Senate votes that would impact my constituents so they
can be as informed and as well-represented as possible.","I believe one of the top priorities for the next UC President should certainly be supporting
our incredible graduate students and the COLA movement. The UC claims that they are
protecting undergrads by not supporting the COLA movement because they believe the
graduate students are harming undergrads by protesting -- but the fact of the matter is
undergraduates are almost entirely in support of the movement as well, because we
understand the plight of our graduate students, and we recognize that they are unable to work
to the best of their abilities if they have to be constantly concerned about making rent.
Furthermore, I think the next UC President needs to address rising tuition costs and minimize
them as much as possible, if not entirely eliminate them. UC students are paying incredibly
high tuition prices, and with the growing progressive movement in politics, this is an issue
that certainly needs to be addressed by leaders in the UC system.",,,,,,,
Jesse Macias,arturo,University Owned Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jesse-Macias-Uni-Owned-Housing-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,he/him/his,2nd,Physics,,,"I have experienced and heard many stories about several issues currently impacting
students at our campus. From struggling with mental health issues and finding
accessible services to address food insecurity to sexual violence at local philoanthropy
events, it is unbearable to hear how current issues are posing threats to the wellbeing
of our campus community!
I have befriended several students throughout my education at UCSB and am very
grateful for their friendship. They have supported me in several ways and enriched my
life by sharing their time/moments with me; I was shocked to hear how current
campus issues have affected them, along with their friends, and I would do anything to
help my friends in any way possible!
I heard many remarkable stories about Associated Students (AS) at our campus and
their effort to improve our campus community. As a timely reader of Daily Nexus
newspapers, I read various articles about how the AS Senate and Executive branches
made great accomplishments to serve our student body. From introducing two
international senator seats and the establishment of the Basic Needs and Resource
Center to successful lobbying to bring $10,000,000 to UCSB to provide summer
financial aid, I was happy to hear their inspirational stories about their success in AS.
It is a privilege to work in an environment filled with a diversity of like minded
individuals and I dreamed about being a part of AS to make contributions to their
efforts to serve students in need.
When I heard that AS are searching for Senator candidates for next year, I was
passionate about this opportunity and decided to run to join the AS Senate. I see there
is a lot of potential for growth and promoting campus change there; Being in the
Senate would allow me to be at a better position to work with my friends and other
students to address campus issues and promote change. My presence in the Senate
would also better connect my friends with AS and allow them to collaborate with like

minded AS members, who share the vision of creating a better campus environment
for all students!","My former involvement in hall councils has been a major contribution to my preparation as
a Senator. When I served as a floor representative while at San Nicolas and a House
Representative while at Manzanita village, it introduced me to a part of the structure of
Associated Students during my time at hall council.
The hall council participants were very open to listen to many presenters who introduced
various proposals to host events to enhance living experiences for all residents. After each
presentation was made, many participants actively expressed their opinions/support during
the discussions to approve their requests based on their benefits and the allocated budget for
our group. Not only did I gain exposure to the process required to process proposed
requests, but prepared me for the discussion process I may experience when making
decisions to support/address proposed legislation in Senate meetings.
My involvement with the Voter Registration Volunteer Coalition (VRVC) and several
clubs/organizations has also made a significant contribution to my preparation as a senator.
Helping the VRVC with their mission to increase voter participation has helped me learn
how to adjust my communication to be approachable to students when registering them for
the midterm election. My participation in various clubs/campus organizations has allowed
me to learn about the many interests/challenges that impact several students from various
backgrounds and be in a friendly environment to better understand campus issues from
diverse perspectives.
As a senator, other senators will take specific stances on particular issues and there will be
times where I would need some more insight on these issues to take a well rounded stance to
represent my constituents. I believe my experience with VRVC and participation in various
organizations will help me relate with students better to gain their insight on specific campus
issues while working with them to develop change. It will also help me be aware about my
approach on a certain issue to state my position on issues while being understanding and
respectful of other opinions/views to work better with other senators.","First, I would propose a resolution to devote more time for open discussion about divestment at
AS Senate/Executive meetings. We are the last UC to not formally pass a resolution on
divestment and must reach an agreement soon to represent our fellow Gauchos at our campus!!!
We should create discussion events between our student body and AS members to openly discuss
and learn more about divestment together as a campus. With more feedback from our peers, the
AS Senate should also open more doors for discussion each meeting until we reach a mutual
understanding to propose our stance on divestment!
Second, I motion to introduce a resolution to increase food variety provided at AS food
distribution services. Food options in UCSB and IV can be costly for many students; it is
challenging for some to have a well balanced diet due to the financial burden and limited options
to access healthy, affordable alternatives. With many food provider services at Santa Barbara, I
propose for AS food entities to form a collaboration with them to increase the goods provided to
students to give them more choices and opportunities to have proper nutrition in an affordable
and accessible way!
Finally, I would propose a resolution to establish an intervention program to help female students
stand up against assault. From the outcry about sexual violence occuring at fraternity houses, we
need to help them stand up for themselves and those around them! We can collaborate with
Green Dot trainers to develop an outreach program to show students how they can be part of the
solution to reduce sexual assault at UCSB; female students will also be taught resistance
strategies to help them to overcome emotional/social barriers to seek for support and empower
them to stand up against perpetrators to prevent sexual assault!","I stand to support my fellow Uni-Owned housing peers who may struggle with food insecurity
and mental health issues by enhancing current resources at Uni-Owned apartments to meet their
needs. When they are struggling or experiencing hard times, they will be able to have a place
where they can receive the care and support they deserve to overcome them! I also stand to
improve former apartment infrastructure, improve bus service quality, improve parking services,
and improve energy efficiency to improve the quality of living at university owned housing for
all residents!

To make this into a reality, I will need all the support I can get to achieve my campaign. While in

office, I will reach out to my constituents to ask them for their opinion about current issues at
university owned apartments and how they should be addressed better. Receiving their feedback
will help me understand their needs and what must be done to address these issues better.
I will create a resolution and inform my residents to allow them to participate in the process. This
will allow me to be in a better position to work with them to create well informed solutions that I
can propose to promote change!
I then will revise my resolution based on their response and present it to the AS Senate to bring
awareness about the needs of my constituents. I believe other Senators can guide me to certain
entities who I can work with or can volunteer to support my request. With the support and
involvement of campus organizations and fellow AS members, together we can be able to create
a pathway to establish a solution to meet the needs of my constituents while achieving the goals I
have set.","I first hope to work with the Student Apartment Community Council to host workshops to
promote student resources and represent resident’s interests. With a diversity of students
living at UCSB, having these workshops will bring more awareness to resources devoted to
supporting residents while cherishing the diversity of cultures and identities at Uni-Owned
housing. I also hope to work with them to develop solutions to address current issues that can
impact residents- like food insecurity, improving energy efficiency and current infrastructure
of apartments, and parking- and improve the quality of living for all residents.
I also hope to work with the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity to host
workshops and create open discussion groups at uni-owned housing to support LGBTQ
residents. Not only will this increase their recognition, but also provide a welcoming
environment where they can share their experiences and encourage more allies to help them
feel safe amongst their peers.
I finally hope to work with the Public and Mental Health Coalition, CAPS, and the Mental
Health Peers to create outreach/open discussion groups for each Uni-Owned apartment to
serve the needs of residents. Having these groups will be a great opportunity for residents to
be in a friendly community where they can openly discuss mental health between each other
and receive support to help them overcome any hardship. Having these groups will also be a
great opportunity to expand their service and promote other mental health resources to
address long waiting times at CAPS while making mental health services more accessible for

residents.","If it comes to a point where remote instruction shall continue through both summer and fall
quarter, sharing my time and moments with the constituents I represent would be the best
way I can keep in touch with them.
As we all have different priorities as students, I can forecast my availability to schedule
weekly zoom call sessions based on their availability in various ways. Whether eating lunch
together virtually or having a coffee chat, this would be a time to see how they are, share our
experiences, and discuss specific campus issues in a personally interactive way! It can also
be a place to host open discussion groups to connect one another in a community where we
can discuss our experiences and share tips/advice to help each other cope through these hard
times.
Utilizing social media is another great way to stay connected with my constituents! I believe
they all have special interests/passions and I would like to create an environment where they
are acknowledged!
During my free time, I can support current campaigns or start movements on social media to
support and share their interests on a good cause. A wonderful example is creating gratitude
events, where residents can share their appreciation to the paramedics and heros who risk
their lives to develop a cure to save millions of lives across the world from Convid-19
(parade.com, 40 ways to stay social during the coronavirus quarantine)!
This would also be a way to allow residents to share any skills/talents/interests with others to
create better opportunities to connect with each other. Whether watching movies or having a
virtual game night and creating personalized gifts together, there are many possibilities to
bring excitement and entertain each other during our free time!","I believe AS is not only looking for students who have more experience, but those who are
passionate about serving the student body. As I spoke with and lived amongst my peers as a
fellow Gaucho, I have heard and experienced the issues impacting students at our campus. I
truly love to help others and as I have done so, I have met many students along my

educational journey at UCSB.
It is truly a blessing to befriend them, they have brought much meaning in my life. They
have shared my adventures, supported me, laughed with me, shared their moments with me,
and helped me reach where I am today. I am grateful for their support and would do
anything to help my friends in return. I was shocked to see how current campus issues have
impacted my friends and the students around me. I feel concerned about their wellbeing and
want to help them feel happy and have the best support to achieve their goals and academic
success.
This position would help me be in a better position to support and serve my fellow Gauchos
to improve the experiences for all students. With my current connections with students, my
presence in the AS 71st Senate would help them be connected to AS and work towards
making UCSB a better place for them and those to come. I believe change is possible
through collaboration and unity with the support of every student and I can utilize my
creativity, share my passions, and share my time to make contributions to uplift the campus
community! What makes me the best candidate for this position is having many positive
connections with other students and having a vision that we share to work together to
improve o","(d) Other: I lean left mostly, but lean right on certain issues.","(a) Excellent: I believe they did a remarkable job to maintain their
commitment to serve and support the student body. From the establishment of the Basic
Needs and Resource Center (BNRS) to creating an interactive AS app and introducing two
international senator seat positions, they have effectively initiated a pathway to reconnect
students with the AS student government, keeping AS members accountable to constituents,
and made significant measures to resolve critical issues currently impacting students.","(b) No: I would prefer to have more open discussion about
divestment between members of AS and other students before proposing a resolution.
Divestment is a controversial issue at our campus; many students have differing views about the
BDS movement and a lack of a mutual understanding between one another often leads to heated
debates/conflict. I believe being more open to discussion would make divestment more
approachable for AS members to develop a well-rounded resolution that is in agreement to all
students at UCSB.","(b) No: I believe student tuition fees increase the value of education. The funds
collected are used to pay for the costs required to provide, and maintain, the services
offered to support a student&#39;s academic and personal wellbeing. I appreciate how having
access to all these resources have supported my academic journey and believe they have
benefited several students across the campus. However, I also believe tuition costs should
be adjusted to help students from lower income backgrounds afford their education.
Tuition costs should remain stable to reduce the financial burden placed on them and
make college more accessible for all students.","I believe current mental health services are adequate in its service to support students, but not
adequate to be accessible to all students. Although current mental health services have done a
wonderful job in supporting students in need, they must develop a strategy to provide
conveniently to address rapidly growing demand currently and in future years.
Based on the results from UCSB’s first mental health town hall, there was agreement about
how challenging it is to provide access to many students who are urgent to receive mental
health services due to the long waiting times. This issue is especially apparent during
midterm and final season, where most students are experiencing time conflicts and have other
urgent priorities. It is awful to hear about how some students, who experience unbearable
hardships, desperately seek support at CAPS and are unable to receive the support when they

need it the most. Without immediate help, they can experience severe consequences that can
be detrimental to their academic and personal wellbeing. Long waiting times should not hold
students back from receiving the quality support they deserve and there should be a way to
make services more accessible to all students!
AS members have worked very hard to address this issue and propose many suggestions or
solutions to expand these resources on campus. One that I agree with is the proposal of
advertising other campus organizations/programs that provide mental health services.
Most faculty and students tend to advertise CAPS as the solution to their needs, leading to
higher demand and longer waiting times. Most of these students, especially freshmen, are
not aware of other alternative resources, such as CARE, that can provide quality mental
health services like CAPS. Students and campus mental health services should work with
faculty to develop a way to better communicate about alternative resources with their
students.
They should also consider finding a way to expand current resources to address rapidly
emerging needs during midterm/final seasons, like developing a student outreach group to
provide quality service at residence halls. Not only will this greatly reduce long waiting
times, but improve the effectiveness in providing accessible service to all residents.","Indeed, this is true. Although Title IX demands for confidential reportings/reporting services
to protect student privacy, Title IX also clearly demands that the university must maintain
confidentiality unless the situation is a threat against the safety of the campus community.
Even though the university strives to abide by Title IX policy, I believe the university should
reveal at least the name of the fraternities where sexual misconduct was involved to better
inform students for their own safety.
They should prioritize protecting the campus community rather than withholding specific
details of the crime from students. With more students informed about these incidents, the
more likely action will be taken to address the situation promptly-as entailed by Title IX
policy. Student survivors also should deserve more acknowledgement from the university
and including some more detail-with privacy consent from survivors- in email
communication will help services support survivors and better understand how to address the

issue.
From the university emails sent, I noticed there is a lack of clear communication between the
university and its students. There is not much communication about addressing the issue and
believe that the university should consider improving how it communicates with students on
the basis of issues impacting campus life. The “university should [also] shift from ‘consent
culture’ to tangible prevention and accountability” to prevent further incidents from occuring
(Senator Haddi, “University Silent Regarding Multiple Sexual Assault Cases on Fraternity
Property,” the bottom line).","I do believe Title IX is adequate to define the context and procedures on how this system
address sexual assault, but can have some improvements.
The addition of the Sexual Violence and Sexual Harrassment policy to Title IX effectively
classifies sexual violence on the basis of several possible situations. It became the rule
system to effectively define these issues and shape the UC’s implementation of several
services/policies to address sexual violence on all UC campuses. Some include the
requirement of sexual violence prevention education modules and the creation of confidential
services, like CARE, to educate students and support victums.
It has also outlined procedures for UC Administrators, including Title IX coordinators, to
follow to address sexual assault while protecting student privacy, confidentiality, resisting
retailiation, and abiding by the university’s commitment to protect the UC campus
communities from sexual violence and discrimination (Title IX, Sexual Violence and Sexual
Harrassment policy).
I do believe, however, that this system should improve how it handles cases between
university decisions and violators of the Title IX policy. In regards to the UC Regents
discussion of Title IX and addressing sexual misconduct cases in January, there were issues
between acknowledging case participant’s rights and handling cases properly. This issue has
allowed some convicted students to override verdicts made in court and get away with their
offences committed. I feel that the Regents should expand the procedures on conducting
cases to protect the rights of the accused while keeping perpetrators accountable at court.","Indeed, UCSB has done an incredible job in providing service to underrepresented
groups across campus. With the incorporation of ethnic courses in our education
system, this increased the representation of the diversity of students attending UCSB
and allows any student to be educated about the unique experiences/challenges
underrepresented students encounter. However, I believe there should be some
improvements in their service to underrepresented groups at our campus.
Educating students about underrepresented groups has brought more awareness about
UCSB’s dedication to supporting an inclusive and diverse campus. The addition of
historical and social courses about underrepresented groups in our curriculum has
helped these students feel recognized at campus and led to implementation of social
change.
Even though UCSB is known to be the first American university to historically serve
Hispanic students, I appreciate how the administration expanded the courses and services
offered overtime to give other minority groups the respect and support they deserve. Every
underrepresented student encounters unique challenges and I noticed the great commitment
student services like EOP, RCSCG, and CAPS provides to assist students from every
background. From community discussion groups to specialized events and student resources,
they have done a remarkable job in helping students feel accepted and provide the services
they need to achieve academic and personal success.","I would propose a resolution to ensure a requirement for AS food distribution services to
demand and provide more variety of goods to students they serve.
Many students find it challenging to consume sufficient meals to support their education
at UCSB for various reasons. From financial difficulties to high costs of living and
educational materials, I heard many stories about how students struggle to have access to
proper meals; some rely on fast food products or even skip meals throughout their
education. Some of the fast food products do not provide the proper nutrition that students
need to live a healthy lifestyle and can lead to health consequences in the future. This also
can impair a student’s ability to concentrate during lectures or can affect their
performance during their exams.

Although current services like the AS Food Bank and the Basic Needs and Resource
Center have done an excellent job in serving students in need, I believe they can improve
the variety of food options offered.
I do believe there are several local food providers and services in Santa Barbara who are
willing to donate and support this cause. This proposal would ensure that AS food
distribution services will consider reaching out to them to foster collaboration between
UCSB and Santa Barbara county to provide more variety to ensure that students receive
more options to access healthy, balanced meals in need.","*I would consider promoting Alison Sir’s AS app and contributing to its growth to
better inform the student body about the Senate; It has effectively informed students
about the progress from the Senators to address student needs and believe it has
potential to connect students with AS better.
The Daily Nexus has done a remarkable job in informing students about significant
issues from a student’s perspective; I would also consider encouraging them to
include more articles disclosing meeting details to further inform students about the
Senate through their discussions.
With my current relationships with other students, I believe the best way to connect
them and the student body to AS is to reach out and work together with the students. I
believe students have all experienced these issues and they all play a part in the
solution to create a better academic environment for everyone!!!
Having more students involved with AS members will help Senators develop more
informed decisions and establish better solutions with them to address current issues.
I propose having more campus discussion groups would not only connect the Senate
with the student body, but allow me and others to learn more about current issues
through the eyes of the student body and create change together as a campus! In
addition, having more insight from students can also help us make adjustments to
current decisions to promote change in a favorable way for every student. AS Senate
bill tracker-promote","Sexual assault prevention, Title IX procedure adjustments, enhancing mental health services,
addressing campus food insecurity issues, and establishing a successful remote instruction
procedure in preparation for any future incidents should be the priorities.
With servere incidents of sexual assault at fraternity and university housing this academic year,
the next UC President should enhance sexual misconduct case management and Title IX
university procedures to help university adminstrators respond promptly against sexual
discrimination and keep penetrators accountable at court while maintaining due process and
further reduce sexual misconduct at UC campus’.
Mental health and food insecurity have both been major issues impacting student wellbeing
university wide and severely impairs students’ ability to succeed in their education. Although the
UC has made progress to address these prevalent issues across all UC campuses, the next
president should propose a plan to secure more funding to expand current services offered and
actively address these issues by developing new approaches to meet student needs in an
affordable and accessible way.
The unexpected and rapid transition to remote instruction due to the cornvid-19 global health
crisis created much shock/panic for administrators and students. The university has not been very
prepared to address these sudden issues and I believe the new UC president should actively
establish a system to help UC campuses prepare for any future global pandemics quickly and
effectively.
As sudden crises like coronvid-19 can increase mental health and safety concerns for faculty,
students, and administrators, the development of such a program will help university operations
to adjust to sudden change, maintain the quality of education for students, regardless of external
circumstances, and help administrators be prepared to address sudden changes better while
protecting the safety of students and faculty across the university.",,,,,,,
Aimee Wang,arturo,L&S Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Aimee-Wang-L_S-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,3rd,Sociology,,,"The simple way of answering this question is that I am very passionate about our school and the
student body. I see UCSB and IV as my home. I have been constantly moving since middle
school. I went to three different high schools, and this is the first time in the past ten years for me
to stay at one place for a four year span. I think it is amazing that we have so many diverse
groups on campus pursuing different goals and interests, and I enjoy reaching out to different
entities, hearing their needs, and trying my best to help with them. We are all students, and I
hope everyone can receive the best college experience possible. For almost every student, it is
inevitable to run into some sort of issues throughout college, including myself, and I understand
that during those times, it is very important for students to have somebody to reach out to. And I
want to be that person. I am here to listen to what everyone is going through and offer all the
possible help. On top of that, many students sometimes forget the fact that us students have the
power to make positive changes at our school, and A.S. is one entity that can help make those
tangible changes. Last but not least, there are many marginalized student groups on campus and
it is very important we hear their voices too. Sometimes those groups are not sure how to look
for resources or address their concerns, and I think it is our job to reach out to those groups.","I was appointed as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Alison Sir, the current president of Associated
Students. In this capacity, I assist Alison with ongoing projects by facilitating town halls,
negotiating with law enforcement, and planning fundraiser events. As the only undergraduate
student representative for Letters and Science Faculty Executive Committee, I attend meetings
every other week to address common academic concerns shared by undergraduate students and
contribute my opinions during faculty discussions. I am also in charge of the Fellowship
Program for Associated Students. The fellows and I have been working projects to improve
future freshman’s first year experience. I believe that this past year has really brought me a lot of
exposure to AS and my experience has inspired me to pursue a position helping the study body.","The first resolution I would like to introduce is increasing the number of academic advisors. It is
already very hard to make appointments with academic advisors, sometimes students need to

wait for weeks to go talk to an advisor. With the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of us are
questioning the quality of online school and are worried about graduating and finding jobs. There
will be a large number of students seeking academic help and guidance so I think we need to
increase the number of academic advisors. Secondly, a bill will be dedicated to form a closer
coalition with IV Tenant Unions. Student residents constantly face problems with their leasing
companies and I think there should be a contract on how to better protect students’ interests.
Lastly, I would like to start an Emergency Circumstance Committee in A.S. to support students
dealing with extraordinary events such as the coronavirus. Everyone in A.S. is here to offer help
under whatever circumstance, but each position also holds their own responsibilities. Emergency
Circumstance Committee will be specifically delegated to help students with their concerns and
needs when unforeseen events take place.","Among the list of things I plan on doing, I am most passionate about the “Major Carnival”. I
came to UCSB as a Sociology major, but through the past two years I had considered switching
to many other majors such as Political Science, History, Psychology, etc. In the past years, I have
met a lot of students unsure about what to major and what to expect from their major. While
having the “Major Carnival”, professor representatives and department deans will table at the
beginning of fall quarter to give students presentations on what to expect from each major and
allow students to ask questions afterwards. To touch on the rest of my platform, I want to
implement a course on mental health in the GE curriculum, outreach to the international student
community to better represent them, increase the availability of major prerequisite classes by
offering more of them online during summer sessions, and connect student engagement by
uplifting student clubs and organizations.","I would like to work with CAPS and the L&S Faculty Executive Committee on implementing a
course on mental health. While helping ASOP organize the first mental health town hall this past
quarter, I got the chance to meet with multiple mental health facilitators from CAPS and Student
Health. During the discussion session after the town hall, they were very interested when I
brought up implementing a class on mental health. I will reach out to them during my term and
have more tangible plans. I would also like to work with L&S Faculty Executive Committee on
creating the “Major Carnival”. I will bring a detailed proposal to the L&S FEC meeting and
reach out to the department deans of each college.","I will post my contact information including my email, phone number on Facebook and hold
weekly Zoom meetings. Students are welcome to contact me in whichever way they prefer and I
will respond to them as soon as possible.","(Similar to my answer from Question 1) In addition, this is my third year at UCSB and I have
been fairly involved in different organizations and groups on and off campus. I am familiar with
the structure of A.S.and acknowledge what needs to be improved within A.S. to better serve the
students’ interest. I am always on top of my work and can definitely be held accountable for my
position if I get elected. Lastly, as an international student, I empathize the struggles many
marginalized groups have to encounter and understand the importance of having their voice to be
heard.",(a) Left-leaning,"(c) Good. After working in A.S. Office of the President for the past two quarters and
attending multiple Senate meetings, I have witnessed great accomplishment the 70th Senate
has achieved. They have worked deligently on improving transparency, and I think they
have also done a reasonanly good job responding to urgent crises including the incidents of
sexual assault, COLA strike, and the coronavirus. However, I do believe that they can
improve the productivity of Senate meetings, more effectively inform the student body with
all the resources A.S. is able to offer, and more regularly update students with the progress
they make or projects they are currently working on.","Currently, I do not have a definite stance on BDS. I deeply sympathise with both religious
groups, and I do believe that we should stand in solidarity with the marginalized groups.
This movement includes many stakeholders and I feel it would be best to become more
educated on this issue from students with a more developed perspective and understanding
of this topic in order to formulate an opinion. I would like to attend at least a few local
public forums on the subject of BDS and listen to both sides’ arguments before deciding
whether I am in favor of this resolution or not.","(b) While I believe free education should be a universal privilege for students around the
nation. I think it would be very challenging for UCSB to be completely tuition free at this
time. The priorities right now should be fighting against tuition hikes, lowering overall
tuition costs, better allocating our tuition and student fees, and providing more resources for
the student body.","I do not think we have adequate services for mental health at UCSB, and also a considerable
amount of the students are unaware of the available services. In the past three years, I have
heard numerous frustrations on booking appointments at CAPS or Student Health, and many
students are unsure about how to seek help or whether they need to seek help. I don’t think
there should be incidents of students having to wait for weeks, or months, for an appointment
at CAPS. This year, as a member of A.S. Office of the President, I have worked diligently on

raising awareness on mental health and uplifting student’s concerns on a legislative level by
helping host the first mental health town hall at UCSB and discussing this subject with
multiple faculty members and staff. I have noticed that many mental health advisors also
expressed the shortage of support and resources from the school level. With that being said, it
is critical and urgent for UCSB to revise the system and fund more on mental health services.","The answer is YES. I absolutely believe the university could have handled the situation better. I
saw many great initiatives taken by student leaders, but not much from the school. After all the
incidents happened the past fall quarter, I attended the public forum held by SASA where
students were able to communicate with administrations about their concerns. I think the school
administration should have reached out to the survivors and provide sufficient support. I would
also like to see the school taking more actions to prevent such incidents from happening in the
future including raising awareness of sexual assault.","I think Title IX sets the foundation of awareness of sexual assault on UC campus, but it does
not effectively prevent incidents related to sexual assault from happening. There is also still a
considerable amount of students at our school that are unaware of this system and the
seriousness of this topic. I acknowledge that the school does touch on this subject at various
occasions including the Gaucho FYI, OrgSync workshops, etc; however, I think the school
should develop another more formal and separate system educating its students this subject
and what Title IX entails.","One main aspect I love about UCSB is the diversity of this community. There are many
incredible student organizations dedicated to the underrepresented groups on campus, and there
are also valuable resources provided by the school for those communities. However, I think the

awareness is mainly shared among students and faculty, but not on the administration level.
With that being said, I think the school can do a better job “reaching out” to these
underrepresented groups. In the past three year that I have been at UCSB, there have been a few
incidents where underrepresented groups had to face derogatory slander and unjustified
discriminations, but the school did not act too much on those incidents. When such things
happen in our community, I think the school is obligated to send some forms of message to the
community addressing these issues, and empathize with the underrepresented groups by
reaching out to them and offering potential help.","I would like to work on a resolution helping students with their academic needs. Students
right now are facing many uncertainties and frustrations due to the COLA strike and the
Coronavirus. Many of us do not know if we are getting the most out of our college
education. When we are able to go back to school, hopefully in the fall, I would like to
conduct a survey to see what are the students’ biggest academic concerns after everything
we had to experience and ensure the quality of our education by communicating with
department deans to help with students’ frustrations. In this bill, I would also like to
include a section discussing when similar events happen in the future, how could the
school ensure the education quality for the students.","I would definitely like to improve the transparency of A.S..To rebuild the image of A.S., I would
love to invite the Exec Office and a few Senator representatives to present at every Freshman
Orientation and table during the first week of each quarter. To keep the student body informed
throughout the quarter, I will work on passing a bill that would require sending out a weekly
email with the agenda of each Senate meeting, summaries of the previous senate meeting, and a
quarterly report of what A.S. had accomplished in the 10 weeks period. I also acknowledge that
most students, more or less, have some concerns or questions, but they do not have the time to
attend Senate meetings. I would love to conduct a weekly survey for the student body so that we
will be able address some of the major concerns without having them come to Senate meetings.","The UC President takes large responsibilities on the overall development of the entire UC system
and is also capable of taking many initiatives that will improve the education system in
California. There are a few top priorities I think the next UC President should be focusing on.
The most urgent one is to handle the fallouts of Coronavirus. Students are experiencing various
difficulties or have already encountered many unfortunate outcomes this pandemic has brought
to them. Those outcomes include the cancellation of their study abroad programs, difficulties
with re-registering their spring classes, ability to pay their tuition/living due to the loss of their
jobs, and etc. There are also many concerns expressed by the general student body such as the
partial refund of their tuition due to the new policy of online classes. Although we cannot predict
how long this devastating pandemic will last and how soon the world will be able to recover
from it, the next UC President should have tangible plans for all UC schools to best recover from
it, and work on drafting policies to improve the overall system so we would be more prepared if
similar outbreaks happen again in the future. On top of dealing with the aftermath of
Coronavirus, there are a few other issues that need to be addressed also. With the continuing
growth of students at all UC campuses, there should be more adequate resources provided for
each campus; putting in continuing effort on helping student groups that are experiencing social,
economic, and political issues; and continuing the initiative reaching carbon neutrality by 2025.",,,,,,,
Hayley Slater,arturo,L&S Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Hayley-Slater-L_S-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,she/her/hers,3rd,Political Science,,,"College is one of the best yet most stressful times of a student's life. UCSB has been one
of the best decisions I have ever made and the students at UCSB have truly impacted my
life in the most positive ways. With all that being said however, there are flaws at UCSB
and I have experienced many hard times with nowhere to turn. I began getting involved
in A.S during my sophomore year and I realized that my entire freshmen year there were
so many resources and help available for me that I never knew about. I want to be a
Senator to extend my reach to students and make A.S. more accessible to everyone. As
well as learning about all the great resources, I also started to become more aware of the
ways in which UCSB fell short and started to see that UCSB may not always have
student interests at heart. This has motivated me to want to work within administration
and within UCSB to be a voice for students so we do not get overshadowed by decisions
made for us but are able to make our own decisions about our education.","Over the last year I have served on the board of the Isla Vista Tennant’s Union where I
have learned to take student concerns and turn them into real change. Due to current
events with COVID-19 and the change to remote instruction, I have been really involved
with the IVTU Emergency Fund where students can apply for financial compensation for
unexpected movings, storage or housing relocation costs. This has shown me that while

UCSB does have great resources for students, there are a lot of areas where UCSB can
improve their support for students. This experience I have had with the IVTU has not
only given me the skills to tackle being a senator, but it has given me the experience to
begin to understand where changes need to be made.","The first bill I would introduce while in office, would be adviser live chats in order to
make academic advising more accessible to students. The academic advising office is
such a great resource, however I believe they can help students more effectively and help
more students overall if their office was more accessible and quicker to access such as a
live chat. Secondly, I would like to introduce a bill that creates a classroom reserve
system for group study during finals week beyond only library study rooms. During finals
week, what personally helps me the best is working with other students to ask questions
and discuss important topics, however library study rooms are reserved fast and hard to
get. Therefore, by increasing spaces, such as unused classrooms, more opportunities for
successful studying will be given to students. Lastly, in light of this year's flu season
affecting many students, and now the unfortunate pandemic affecting our world, I would
like to implement a bill that allocates student funds to provide essential health supplies to
students for free such as health masks and gloves.","-CREATE live chats with academic advisors for more quick and efficient access to academic
counseling
-INCREASE the amount of study spaces available for students during finals by creating a
classroom reserve system for group study
-IMPROVE upon safety protocols by increasing the number of Blue Lights on campus and in
Isla Vista to aid students in emergency situations
-IMPLEMENT emails reminding students of pass times as well as create a wishlist on GOLD in
order to make signing up for classes stress-free
-EXPAND health resources by providing free supplies such as health masks and gloves in the
Library and around campus

In order to achieve these goals I plan to devote a great amount of time in building
relationships with the school, executives and other senators so that we can work together
to make these changes. I also plan to keep students involved with the changes I want to
make so that they can become as passionate as I am about them.","In order to achieve my platforms, I need to work mainly with the academic advising
office. As a collegiate senator my main priority is to alleviate academic problems on
campus for students in the Letter and Sciences college. As a student in the Letter and
Sciences college for over two years now, my biggest concern with the program is
obtaining classes and knowing which classes to take to make a plan for my years at
UCSB. Two of my platforms include creating a more navigable Gold in which students
can sign up for classes easier and creating live chats with advisers so students can ask
questions regarding their major and college more quickly and effectively. By working
hand in hand with the advising office and academic offices on campus, I will be able to
create a line of communication to turn these platforms into reality and express other
problems that come to my attention during my term as Senator. Beyond academics, if I
were to be Senator I would also have the responsibility to represent all UCSB students.
While my constituents remain students in the College of Letter and Science, it is my goal
to reach out to all groups on campus whether, professional, religious, cultural etc.","If online courses continue throughout summer and fall term, I will make it my goal to be
open to student concerns nearly 24/7. In order to accomplish this I want to promote the
use of email, which I would check regularly, and I would hold Zoom office hours for
students to join in and voice their concerns. Through these avenues, students who would

regularly reach out or join my office hours in person, would have the same opportunity to
do so. Lastly, with social media being a huge part of our lives as college students, I would
increase my social media presence to keep students updated on what I am working on and
what the Senate as a whole is discussing and accomplishing. This way, students who may
not have come into office hours on their own, can join in and ask questions or voice
opinions on the work of my Senate office and the whole Senate.","There are three things that make me the best candidate for this position: hard-work,
experience and personality. First of all if elected to the Senate, I would devote nearly all
my time outside of academics to make my platforms become reality. Working on the
IVTU board has taught me how much time and effort goes into making effective change
on campus and I am ready to tackle this to the best of my ability. Second, my experience
working within A.S. as well as my experience as a UCSB student for nearly three years
now, has shown me the changes that need to be made as well as how to turn them into
reality. Lastly, I have always been a social person who is not afraid to go and talk to
anyone. This trait will guide in my goal to reach out to all students on campus and
effectively listen to their concerns and communicate them to staff.",(a) Left-leaning,"(b) Very Good. I think the 70th Senate has successfully detoxified the Senate in a way that has promoted
Senators working together in a healthy and bipartisan way. The 70th Senate has worked
together to truly be a voice for all students. For example, while still pending approval
from the Senate, the introduction of two international student senate seats truly
encompasses the Senate's goal of being inclusive and representative.","At this time, I do not have enough information on the issue to form
an opinion. I look forward to learning more on the topic.","(b) No; I believe that tuition costs as they are, are too high and a financial burden for many
students and families. However, I think that the part of tuition that goes towards funding
staff as well as student resources is a great importance on campus. Student-funded
resources such as CAPS, AS Food Bank, IVTU etc. are valuable and influential resources
for students. As senator, I would love to help alleviate students’ financial burden.","I believe that UCSB has great mental health resources and CAPS, to me, is one of the
most helpful and influential resources on campus. However, nearly every student faces
some sort of mental health issue while in college that requires support and help. While

mental health services on campus help many students, they are not equipped to handle the
multitude of students who seek support. I have heard too many times that students have
tried to use CAPS and were never able to get appointments or the appointments they did
get were not soon enough. Students often need help now and are unable to wait weeks to
see someone. This has led to many people I know go to other avenues of help outside of
UCSB. I think that UCSB needs to take strides in order to expand their mental health
services to meet the needs of all students.","The school did react to the situation, however it was only after students decided to
take action that the school followed. The school’s response was delayed and the way
they addressed information was vague and confusing. The school needs to be more
proactive and transparent about issues such as sexual assault and other dangers to our
community. The strides they made such as probation and a change in IFC and
Panhellenic rules did help alleviate the situation, but it was more a quick fix to one
problem rather than tackling the severity of the increasing problem on campus.","I believe that Title IX is a good starting point for UCSB, but is not adequate enough
moving forward. The basis behind Title IX is positive and sets a good standard for
UCSB’s expectation of their students, however it lacks guidance and security. I
believe the system should be more navigable to students. Students who have been
survivors of sexual assault shoud be able to access the Title IX system easier and have
a guideline of what they can expect when using it. I believe Title IX leaves a lot of
open ended questions to students trying to access it and for survivors who need
support and guidance, this can be very scary. Sexual assault is unfortuately a very
prominent issue on college campuses and therefore the UC’s should take a greater

step in securing more protocols for students.","As I am not a member of these groups, I do not want to speak for or on behalf of the
communities or individuals. However from the perspective as a UCSB student outside of
the communities, I believe UCSB does a good job to set up resources for the Black,
Latinx, LGBTQ+ communities. Where the school lacks to represent these groups is
letting their voice and needs be heard. As a freshman coming into the school two years
ago, I never really heard of opportunities and groups at UCSB for students of these
communities. It was not until I joined AS that I realized what important work these
communities do. I believe that all students should be aware of the impact these
communities have on the school. As a Senator I will work with all groups on campus in
order to get their voice heard to all people at UCSB and take their concerns directly to the
Senate.","My first concern if I were to serve in the 71st Senate would be to address academic
advising for Letters and Sciences students. My goal is to set up live chats during
working hours with staff or student staff to make advising more accessible to
students. Oftentimes students have questions or concerns that have simple solutions
that don’t require going in person and waiting in line to speak to someone. By
creating live chats I believe a lot of stress will be taken off students shoulders and it
is an easy way for students to have better accessibility to their resources.","I think the president’s project on making an AS app with all the resources available
is a great first step. As a Senator I would like to expand this to include run downs
of each Senate meeting, topics the Senate is discussing and new bills passed within
the Senate. As much of our lives are online, I think an app is a great way to tackle
information on campus. I would also like to see news letters emailed out to students
with this same information as well as encouragement to get more students to come
to public forums and voice their concerns. I believe the more students involved and
aware of the Senate, the more impact the Senate will have on campus.","My top priority in looking for the next UC President is safety and transparency. During
my time at UCSB, me and my fellow students have been impacted by devastating fires,
mudslides and now a pandemic. With each impact, I have been confused and lacked
guidance from the school and UC system as a whole. With recent events, I would hear
news about other UC’s and very vague information from UCSB. With the stress of these
events, I felt as if all I needed was to feel as if the UC system had mine and students'
safety as their top priority as well as keeping us updated with what is happening and
being discussed. I understand that the school does not want to overwhelm or confuse
students, however, I think that the lack of transparency increases stress on students. In the
next UC president I look for a president who will set guidelines students can look to in
these times, as well as transparency on protocol and discussions. When it comes to the
UC system, it is our education in the hands of staff and I believe when it comes to our
education we must be a part of the discussion and informed of circumstances.",,,,,,,
Phillip Huynh,arturo,L&S Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Phillip-Huynh-L_S-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,2nd,Political Science and History of Public Policy and Law,,,"In my time here at UCSB, I have grown to acknowledge the campus as my first home. I have
developed lifelong friends and met admirable students that significantly differ from me in leisure
interests, political beliefs, religion, and overall backgrounds. Despite these personal differences, I
care deeply about the community and cherish our diversity as I believe that is what makes UCSB
so special. I have always been interested in student government ever since High School where I
was class president for three years in a row and involved in ASB for all four years. Although my
aforementioned leadership was relatively small-scale when compared to the affairs of the
university’s student government, it has made me realize that true change starts with Associated
Students. The administration is inherently detached from the student community in regards to
what is going on in our lives and the problems that we are facing. I want to make sure that the
voices of students from every aspect of life are heard by the administration and their concerns
deliberately. I want to be an advocate for the student body by voting for initiatives and bills that
will make student lives more convenient, easy, and healthy.","My main involvement throughout my first and second year of college here at UCSB has been
being Social Chair of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. This position has allowed me to sharpen my
organization and creativity due to the practice of planning numerous events. From being the
leader of the social committee and working with other people, I’ve learned to be more diplomatic
and cooperative with others, ensuring smooth planning and execution of events. I believe that
this has prepared me to be a senator because it shows that I am already familiar with working in a
team setting to make a project successful. This would translate over to my actions as a senator

because I would compromise and collaborate with others to pass the best legislation possible.
Furthermore, being in a position of leadership and respect within my fraternity has prepared me
for being a spokesperson for the students. During my term as Social Chair, I would always gauge
the ideas for events and listen for constructive criticism on my performance. Similar to my
endeavours with Kappa Sigma, as a Senator, I realize that I would be working for a body bigger
than myself and that, I would stay true to those interests at the end of the day. In other words, as
my priority as social chair was the other members of the fraternity, my priority as a senator
would be the students.","One of the bills I would like to introduce while in office is to transition our campus into
becoming more sustainable by technologically upgrading our less renovated buildings. The
implications of this bill would prompt the construction of more Elkay Filtered hydration stations
and push-button sink faucets for older buildings like Girvetz, Phelps, North and South Halls. As
UCSB is becoming increasingly modern in its technological cultivation, we must also maintain
our standard of being environmentally conscious. Not only would this transition be a great step
towards sustainability, it would also improve the lives of the students with access to clean and
filtered water everywhere on campus.

Another bill I would like to introduce while in office is for UCSB to start funding
psychodiagnostics testing at the CAPS center to be able to assess the mental health of students
more accurately. Many students here have gone to CAPS when they need help and come back
unsatisfied with their visit, typically because their problem was not actually addressed.
Psychodiagnostics testing would allow us to identify our mental deficiencies and better
understand the motions of our communities. If we fund these analytical tests, we would be able
to break down these issues and come up with solutions or treatment.

A bill that I would also introduce is one that establishes a pop-up food bank that would work to
battle food insecurity and maintain the well-being of our students. I discuss this bill more
in-depth in question 16.","My platform revolves around well-being, academic opportunities, sustainability, vital resources,
and equality for our students. Regarding the well-being of UCSB of students, I would like to
institute a pop-up Food Bank supplied with affordable and healthy food and refreshments for
late-night studies (12 am-6 am) near the library during Finals Week; I discuss this more in-depth
in question 16. I also discuss my plans to reduce textbook costs and increase student involvement
in question 5.

Furthermore, a primary concern of mine is the lack of attention given to some majors in the
College of Letters and Science. The College of Letters and Science has over 80 disciplines and
majors, and it consists of the majority of the school’s population. With a finite number of
advisors and resources, some departments are left with minimal funding and professional
advising, while other majors that are more competitive receive extra opportunities and academic
support. I want to equalize resources and opportunities for all majors in the College of Letters
and Science by allocating more funding to the underrepresented departments. To do this, I will
gauge comments and feedback from the students in each department in the college and work to
improve their experience from there. I would do this by working with professors, department
chairs, advisors, and the administration to see how we can collectively work to set up more
professional networking gatherings and internship and tutoring outreach via emails specific to
the student’s major.","One of my priorities if I were to be elected to the Senate would be working to alleviate the
mental health struggles and pressures of students to the best of my abilities. A method that I
would pursue to do this is incentivising student involvement by working with administrators and
department chairs for the College of Letters and Science to designate one hour of a week where
there will be no classes to make time for club meetings, sport practices, community service, etc.
A common factor harming the well-being of students is that they sometimes feel as if they are
going through their struggles alone, but are unwilling to seek out counseling and other resources
to ease their well-being. Student involvement with organizations is crucial in making them feel
like they have a community and friends to confide in and vent to. However, students also feel
that they don’t have the time to become engaged with the community because of academia
filling up their weekday schedules. Therefore, I would work with administrators and department
chairs to persuade them of the importance of extracurriculars and negotiate an official weekly

“no-class period”.

Additionally, I would also work to lower the cost of textbooks for students by increasing the
amount of E-Book Course Reserves in the library and work with professors and their
departments to provide open-source textbooks for their courses. The tuition at UCSB is already
expensive enough, and the cost of textbooks per quarter can be an overwhelming financial
burden for middle and lower-income students. Especially for students who are independent of
external financial support and pay for their own rent, bills, tuition, food, etc.; worrying about
hundreds of dollars in textbooks should be the last thing on their minds. I hope to empathize with
professors and their departments in this sense, and plead for them to make the required materials
for their classes, such as textbooks, easily accessible to students of all financial backgrounds .","Before we go into summer quarter and fall quarter, I will post my email on social media so
students have a way of contacting me personally if they have something they would like to talk
to me about. Additionally, for summer and fall quarter, I plan on holding office hours once a
week via Zoom. These office hours will be similar to a town hall setup where students in the
Zoom session can ask me about different legislation Associated Students are working on, voice
to me their concerns or constructive criticism, and overall, general questions about the school. I
will repeatedly post weekly reminders about my office hours on different social media platforms
to inform my constituency of when exactly I am holding my office hours. If constituents cannot
make it to my office hours, I am usually never too far from my email and will respond to
constituent emails in a timely manner. Hearing from my constituency and receiving feedback
will be very important to me in ensuring I do the best job possible. I want to make sure that each
and every one of the students in the college of Letters & Science can contact me and feel
comfortable doing so.","Coming from a 1st generation and low-income minority background, I feel that I can be
empathetic and aware of the varying concerns that embody many students here. With my
unstable upbringings of moving from place to place and even being in the foster care system at
one point, I have personally experienced food and financial insecurity in many aspects of life.

Especially in college, we students are expected to be self-sufficient and grow independent of
parental support, which becomes increasingly difficult with the pressures of academia and
financial responsibilities. I think I am the best candidate to voice and act on these concerns as a
liaison between the student body and the administration simply because I understand these
hardships.

Additionally, I believe that my leadership skills and understanding of what it means to be a
leader for this campus is what ultimately distinguishes me from every other candidate. If elected
to the A.S. Senate, I would be surrounded by people who are very opinionated and outspoken. I
believe the most effective way to lead this type of group is to emphasize our collective identity as
Gauchos with similar goals signifying that our conflict of interests do not make us opponents but
simply allies with different preferences of policy. Being confronted with a diverse board of
opinions and personalities would inevitably lead to aggressive verbal disputes. My experiences
of being in student government all throughout high school and being in a fraternity these last two
years has taught me to think in the long-term and be diplomatic and collaborative for settings
such as the Senate. With me as the Senator for the College of Letters and Science, I can assure
efficiency and effectiveness in carrying out legislation to improve student lives with my ability to
work well with others.",(a) Left-leaning,"(a) Excellent: I believe that the 70th A.S. The Senate has done an excellent job in being inclusive to all
communities of UCSB. Their accomplishments that I admire the most are establishing two
international student senator positions on the Associated Students Senate in order to expand
inclusivity to all students, addressed sexual assault allegations by utilizing a sexual assault
task force with other student leaders on campus, and gathered funding for vending machines

to relieve food insecurity in IV. They have made great contributions to maintain safety,
improve the lives, and ease the experiences of the student body.","I currently don't feel educated enough on the issue to make a decision on how I would vote. As a
representative of the student body, I would prefer to learn more about divestment and BDS from
constituents in order to cast a vote reflecting a better understanding of the issue. In addition to
becoming better educated about the issue, I would also like to learn about how I can be
accommodative to students on both sides.","Yes, I believe that UCSB should be tuition-free. Although the federal government provides a
significant amount of financial aid for lower-income students, there is a large number of middle
class families who do not qualify for financial aid. The families who barely miss the threshold
are subsequently faced with such steep tuition costs that they are unable to pay. UCSB is a public
university and its education should be free to all of its students. We should be considerate of
those who simply seek a higher education here and not impose such heavy financial burdens on
less fortunate households.","I think that UCSB offers a plethora of helpful mental health services but more can be done.
CAPS is a great resource for addressing this issue, but many students are too intimidated or
unwilling to make the trip by themselves to the center. Along with this trend is the perception
that CAPS is the only resource for mental health when in reality, there’s others that can
provide students with emotional support, such as the Alcohol and Drug Program, the Health

and Wellness Programs, Education Opportunity Program, and more. I believe that the
students could be more informed of the services offered to them, and we need to work with
the mental health task force to educate students on how to better navigate these resources.
Additionally, I would want to build upon the accomplishments of the current AS President
and hold more Mental Health Town Halls in order to facilitate honest and open
communication between students, administration, and mental health caretakers. Mental
health is too often neglected at UCSB, and I believe this sentiment makes people
uncomfortable in reaching out for help. By holding events that prompt fluid discussion on
these issues, together we can overcome the stigma of mental health and improve the
well-being of all our students.","I believe that the University could have handled the situation better in many different ways.
First, I think the student body deserved to know the specific houses of where the confirmed
cases of sexual assault actually happened. The university was very vague in explaining what
exactly happened and where, which resulted in confusion and fear among the student body.
With increased transparency, the university could have instilled a greater sense of security
into our community during this time. Our community should be able to feel safe while
walking the streets of Isla Vista at night and not be in constant fear of being sexually
assaulted.
I also think that the University should have explained that disciplinary actions were being
taken to hold Greek life accountable for these actions. If the students were formally notified
by the university that all fraternities were put on social probation until they could implement
stronger and safer risk management protocols, then their minds would be put at more ease. It
seemed that the university only mentioned the situation and did not clearly prompt the
development of a solution which was why the university’s response to the situation failed to
address the concerns of the students.","I definitely disagree with the argument that Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual

assault on UC Campuses. Under the Obama administration, there was a sufficient amount of
rules and regulations that helped support the victims of sexual assault. However, under Betsy
Devos’ term as secretary of education, many of those rules were revoked making it harder for
victims of these cases to come out freely. I believe that the current Title IX system needs to be
more survivor centered—that is, more sympathetic and understanding of them and their
circumstances. In its current state, the system favors the accused too much and makes it difficult
for survivors to process and move on from their traumatic experience. It creates an environment
pertaining to fear of backlash and hostility from one’s community about coming forward, and
that is something that seriously needs to be reformed.","I believe UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups at UCSB.
For the most part, there are many safe spaces on campus that prohibit hate speech and
social discrimination against these groups. UCSB is a very open-minded and
welcoming campus to communities of all different backgrounds, and I believe this is
one of the hallmark characteristics of our university. The student body here really
emphasizes the importance of diversity and culture to unite the population here with
centers like the Student-Resource Building and the Multi-Cultural Center.
One of the more underrepresented groups I believe UCSB could do better to
accommodate for is the Asian-American population. Asian-Americans make up for
30% of UCSB’s population with a multitude of different organizations like KASA, KP,
TASA, etc., but there is only one room in the SRB that is exclusively for
Asian-American culture. As an Asian-American, I believe that UCSB should use more
resources to help fund and expand the operations of these organizations and groups.","If I were elected to serve in the Senate, the first bill I would plan to author would be
starting a Late-Night On-Campus Food Bank/Center. From my time here at UCSB, I have
found that many of my peers here go to sleep hungry at night, not primarily because of
financial insecurity, but mainly because there’s not a lot of options to get food from at
night—considering their options at night with the Arbor, which closes by 12am, and
Freebirds or Hana, which are off campus and relatively expensive meals for low-income

students. Especially during midterms/finals season, many of our hardworking students
stay up very late at night studying and preparing for tests. I am proposing a type of pop-up
food bank/shop completely funded by AS to be located in the library from the hours of
12am-6am during weeks 4,5,6 and 9,10,11. This establishment would sell cheap and
affordable foods and drinks for students and is designed to waive students’ food insecurity
and maintain their health by providing them with nutritional snacks; it is meant to ease
their academic experience during the quarter’s most stressful times. I would work to
author this resolution immediately and work with the current AS food bank to formulate
an efficient way to gather food and refreshments.","One of the actions that I would take is to include an entire breakdown of student fees and
expenditures on GOLD and in public places like the University Center. I want to
emphasize transparency from Associated Students so the student body can feel more in
touch with the campus. I believe that the best way to do this is to inform the community of
exactly where their student fees are going. This method would allow for the students to be
more engaged and able to constructively criticize or recommend different allocations and
purchases to AS, considering that we are the supreme policy-making body of UCSB.
I would also want to establish a sort of “Town-Hall Meetings” for the student population
to voice their concerns and opinions on issues that AS are directly charged with handling.
Student feedback is extremely important to the success of AS policies and we cannot
possibly expect to adequately serve the student population if we are unaware of their
needs and wants. This would also be a great way to keep the student body informed of
different policies and implementations.
Furthermore, I would personally want to make the students feel comfortable and able to
contact me whenever they have questions or concerns about A.S. The methods I would
use to accomplish this connection are through posting my email online and holding office
hours — both of which I described earlier in question 6.","I believe that the top priority for the next UC president should be inclusivity of
less-privileged and marginalized communities. Although the UC system already does a great
deal for minority and low-income students through financial aid and programs like EOP, they
should be more aware of the circumstances of these students prior to admission. Many UC
students who are more well-grounded and financially stable have had access to more
resources during high school like SAT prep, tutoring classes, etc. These opportunities have
allowed them to attain higher GPAs and greater SAT/ACT scores, of which have
significantly contributed to their admission chances. On the other hand, the majority of
low-income and/or 1st generation college students receive very little aid from their parents
and financial support to access these resources, which translate into lower GPAs and test
scores. The next UC president should make an effort to consider these social discriminations
when it comes to admissions and understand that different backgrounds generally produce
different results.
Another priority that the next UC president should work to improve is the status of the
different UC’s. A UC education is a rewarding and amazing opportunity no matter where it's
from. However, high school students of the current and newer generations have been taught
to believe that the educations at certain UC’s are significantly greater than the others, albeit
all UC’s have the same price of tuition. The UC president should work to improve the
reputation of the smaller UC’s like UC Merced and UC Riverside to increase the amount of
applicants of these schools whose admission rates are more generous.",,,,,,,
Marcello Cutri,katherine,L&S Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Marcello-Cutri-L_S-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,3rd,Global Studies,,,"Coming from South Florida I was extremely nervous to be moving so far away from
home and being completely immersed in a new culture. However, I grew up in such a
different environment so all the worries about that soon faded away. UCSB has given
me the opportunity to be myself and grow into the person here today because the
culture has helped me navigate through the times we are all supposed to find our
interests independently. Not only has UCSB given me an avenue to pursue what I want
to learn academically by allowing me to learn about the places where my family came
from; but it has also allowed me to build a community of people, both students and
professors, who have similar goals and mindsets as I do. For all that UCSB has given
so far and in the future has prompted me to run for senate. This community that I hold
so dear to my heart makes me want to have an impact on future students that come
here and improve on the already amazing things that are offered. Unfortunately I am
nearing the end of my time here, so I want to ensure every student has a similar
outlook of UCSB as I do. By using my voice, becoming senator would help guarantee
leaving an imprint on the community which has already imprinted me with all it has to
offer.","Being an active part of the community during my entire time at UCSB has allowed me
the opportunity to engage with a diverse range of students and professors both on
campus and in Isla Vista. Having access to such a broad group of individuals has
allowed me to understand and implement the diverse range of ideas that I have learned
from fellow peers and through our educators as well. The Global studies department
has provided me with cultural awareness and a way to implement this new found
knowledge in my daily life. Greek life also has contributed to preparing me to become
senator as well. Having a constant exchange of new people helps give perspective on
the amount of different people that make up our community and helps prepare me for
hearing the voices of all the students within the College of Letter and Science from
philosophy majors to biology majors. Also having to complete the workshops on
topics of interpersonal violence and drugs in our community has informed me on the
vast array of issues that the campus community faces. Moreover, being a staff member
on the Santa Barbara Snow Club has also allowed me the opportunity to be engaged in
the whole population in Isla Vista both going to UCSB and CC. Having to go out into
the community to find people that have shared interests for the club by tabling at the
arbor or organizing social events would easily translate to going into the community
and finding out the problems students have with the school.","My first bill I would want to pass would be to create a “Virtual complaint box” for the
students of the College of letters and Science to help foster a more open dialogue
between students and AS. Allowing students to voice their concerns for the school
who might otherwise be apprehensive to go to a member of senate will help the school
solve problems the students face in daily life. Moreover, allowing students to directly
comment on a website will allow AS to see which concerns are affecting students
more than others. Another bill I plan to create is creating more space to study on
campus during times of increased foot traffic in the library like midterms and finals
season. Many of the rooms that are used for sections and smaller classrooms remain
unused during finals and cause strain in the library to accommodate all the students
further perpetuating an already stressful time. By creating a website similar to that in
place when reserving study rooms in the library would be an effective way to create a
more positive environment. Another bill that I want to introduce is the creation of
regular town halls with the residents of Isla Vista about what is going on within the
community that is welcoming to its students. Working with local law enforcement to
talk about relevant statistics within the community regarding increase in drug use and
violence will allow for more people in the community to know very relevant
information on the place that they live. Furthermore, it would give students the ability
to ask questions that they have on the safety of the community.","My platform has three objectives laid out which is to CREATE, INFORM, and
COLLABORATE for the students of UCSB letters and sciences. I plan on
CREATING fixes to problems that currently face students on campus beginning with a resolution that requires teachers to accommodate having multiple midterms on the
same day. Creating solutions to problems like these will help reduce academic burnout some students face when studying for their classes. This burnout leads to lack of motivation for further school related things and keeps students from pursuing other things on campus like joining academic clubs and organizations that are there to make a students time here more enjoyable and enriching. I plan on INFORMING students on a multitude of levels from academic to everyday life. I want to red flag courses on GOLD that are notoriously more difficult, like certain pre major classes, that could allow for students to plan for the quarter ahead with this knowledge in mind. Along with that I plan on making a Town hall that would tell students about relevant information in the community to make us a more informed community about what is going on. Lastly I want to COLLABORATE with resources like the Coastal
Commission fund to keep students up to date on cliff erosion on their properties they
are renting and work with law enforcement in the community to help spread accurate
information. The most important people I want to collaborate with are working to
make this one of the best places to learn and grow!","I plan on working with a number of different entities given by UCSB in order to both be more informed about the on goings on the community and work with them when drafting resolutions or bills. First, I would like to collaborate with the Office of Registrar and the IT department to help establish a way to flag those courses that
require more time and dedication than a typical class at UCSB. Looking at historical data on these classes will help shed light on how students do in the class and will show which classes should be flagged. I will work with the IT department to also create both
the “Virtual complaint box” which could be featured on the Associated Students websites and the website that would allow us to reserve classroom and section rooms for midterm and finals. I also want to work with both Greeks-Go-Green and EAP to
continually strive to reduce our consumption of single use plastics on campus and make us a zero waste campus. To create the Town Hall I not only want to work with law enforcement but the Alcohol and Drug programs on campus that offer a multitude of resources to students as well as help with substance abuse in IV. Furthermore, I want to inform people on all the resources that can be found when using these programs that many students don't know it's offered.","I will provide a number of ways to allow for students to reach out and to me when they have a concern or problem with the college of Letters & Science. I will be extremely active on my social media platforms from Facebook to Instragm and work to create a very open dialogue. I will also do weekly Instagram/Facebook lives which will act as a way for students to voice concerns they have if they do not feel comfortable reaching out to me directly. I will also use this avenue to inform students on what is going on during the 71st senate since many students do not know all the great accomplishments that AS does for students. Moreover, I will be using features like Instagram polls and questions to further my outreach into the community. Furthermore, I will attach my email and my phone number to every available platform if people feel more comfortable directly contacting me and we can discuss anything there as well. I will also be holding a minimum of 3 meeting days during the week via Zoom which would allow for group meetings for students to voice their concern on matters that affect a group of people more then others.","As I have mentioned above I have grown up into a very different environment each with their own cultures and people which has given me the opportunity to learn and implement new ideas. Having parents who immigrated to the US has further enforced that people's ideas, regardless of my stance on them, are valid and should be learned in order to make accurate and informed decisions in everyday life. This would easily transfer over from my everyday life to working on the senate when encountering students that come from varying backgrounds. I'm passionate about the things that I care about and will put my all into anything I set my mind to when it comes to representing the student body. Furthermore, I provide a positive environment for all types of people to come to me for help and guidance on issues that I have personally dealt with myself and provide resources to people on issues that I have not faced myself and will be there every step of the way for support.",(c) Centrist​.,"very good. I think the 70th A.S. The Senate did a great job during their tenure representing the students. They have not only created a new Mental Health Town Hall accessible to all students who are wishing to express concerns within our community, but also helped navigate the student body during one of the strangest and wildest times of most people's life. They showed professionalism and compassion by supporting groups such as the Isla Vista Tenant Union through emergency funds throughout this difficult time.
","The topic of divestment is a much debated and intense topic on the UCSB campus because there has not been a resolution passed on the subject. I believe this is due to a lack of knowledge and complexity of the subject matter, and both I and many other students need to be educated and informed on the topic to take a proper stance on the subject.","No, I do not think UCSB should be tuition-free. UCSB is a tier one research institution with outstanding researchers, professors, and faculty. They run the students' education, research projects, groups, resources, and opportunities that are provided on campus, and tuition is reflected in supporting these. With that being said, the allocation of money should always be as effective as possible in looking out for student interest and I would strive to make help those changes.
","I believe that the services provided by UCSB on the mental health subject are adequate,​ yet could always be expanded and improved to effectively serve the student population​. While the services are great, there are a few key points that should be addressed when using resources like CAPS and should be brought to light. Due to the large student population, CAPs and other councils see a large number of students per quarter and are often backed up a week or two before an official consultation can occur. Having used this resource, the waiting period acts to dissuade students from following through with their appointments as their commitment to receiving help goes down as well. Furthermore, the requirement to first speak with someone who performs an assessment of the needs of the student in the session acts as an additional stressor when wanting to receive consistent counseling during their time here at UCSB. By increasing funding not only for certified counselors, but also increasing the number of peer counselors, will provide relief to the heavily burdened mental health facilities at UCSB and provide help to the councils themselves. Additionally, working closer with mental health professionals in the surrounding areas of Isla Vista, Goleta, and Santa Barbara might also help mitigate the number of students trying to use the resources and allow for students to get the help they need without the long wait times.
","I believe the situation could have been handled with more precision and swifter action than what the university had done. My largest critique would be the delayed response time of the
school and the ambiguity of their responses, for it caused rumors and unfounded stories of criticism that circulated due to a lack of knowledge within the community. In the future, I propose that we have an allocated committee that keeps the community informed and regularly updated in order to promote transparency and honesty throughout Isla Vista. However I will commend the collaborated efforts of UCSB, the Isla vista community, and the Inter Fraternal Council (IFC) because new rules were imposed on Greek life events like designated water stations and sober brothers to monitor the situations at parties. By doing this, they strove to make Greek Life parties safer for every person. Moreover, they created places for students to have their voice heard about the current situation within Isla Vista with the SASA town hall meetings. Thus, the committee will fill the gap of information discrepancy between the school's actions and the community's worries.","Title IX addressing sexaul assult is adequate, but like most things it can be improved upon to make it more streamlined and efficient for people in need of this resource. Survivors of sexaul assult might not be able to read into all the legal protocols that must be taken in order to submit a legitimate claim to the title IX office, ultimately deterring them from taking the proper actions. By clearly stating confidential, private, and secure resources such as UCSB Ombuds, survivors of sexual assault could receive the help they need in simplifying the resources given on the website in order to make it more cohesive and easier to read for survivors, and by making the entire proceeding private from the public it will limit ostracization of the parties and bring the claim forward.
","UCSB has a lot of organizations that were created by students to represent minority groups like the Black Student Union and resources in the Multicultural center like the LGBTQ+ center to help the minority representation find groups of people similar to
them. While I admire UCSB’s student-led initiatives to serve historically marginalized groups, I believe that UCSB admissions, like most places, can still improve upon having more minority representation. However, UCSB does offer preparation for the world outside of college by creating an environment that mirrors what minority groups face after college. By allowing students to create their own cultural communities out of the spaces and resources available, they are preparing students for the real world after their time in college where they will have to find or create new spaces and promote activism in minority groups.
","The first bill I would plan to work on if I was elected would be to allocate more money to the UCSB drug and alcohol program marketing division in order to promote all available resources, such as Gauchos For Recovery and Nicotine counseling, that could be useful to many students on campus. I would also begin working on a resolution to create a Town Hall that would focus on the increase of certain drug usage within the community, along with highlighting the rights of students when interacting with law enforcement. This would help improve the overall student moral and health at our university.
","I believe that while AS represents such a large body of students, it can be for many to come and voice their concerns about the issues going on around them. However, I want to bridge that divide by making myself accessible to all students through social media, personal one-on-one meetings with students, as well as going into the community and asking about the likes and dislikes of what's going on. Furthermore, by making myself transparent on all forms of communication, it will allow for an increase of dialogue between members of A.S. and the community around it. Moreover, by potentially working with the Daily Nexus at the end of each quarter and outlining all the achievement and hot topics of debate within A.S. would allow for students to fully comprehend the decisions that will affect them throughout their time at UCSB.
","In search for a replacement UC President a number of issues must be addressed in order to find an adequate candidate for the position. First, in light of the current state of world affairs I would want a UC president that acts on behalf of all the UC schools in a time of intense crisis to limit confusion like how finals will proceed and what one campus is doing as opposed to others. Having one cohesive voice on issues like this would limit much of the stress and hardships one faces during a time full of uncertainty and would allow for joint efforts through all campuses to help students during this time. Second, I would want to see the next UC president make a clear and direct statement on the COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) that affects all graduate students in the UC system and subsequently affects the UC’s themselves. Furthermore, limiting the increase of tuition for the incoming student should be a top priority along with placing increased emphasis on resources for jobs and graduate programs after students complete their time at one of the UC’s.",,,,,,,
Calvin Jenkins,katherine,Engineering Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Calvin-Jenkins-Engineering-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,"He, Him, His",2nd,Computer Engineering,,,"I am running to be Engineering Senator with the 71st senate because I believe that many students in the College of Engineering are not aware of AS and what they do, and that many students stand to benefit from increased AS involvement in engineering. First, mental health is a huge issue in engineering, and I think AS, which recently pushed for a new mental health task force, could offer a lot of support and help for engineers. Second, there are numerous wonderful engineering organizations on campus that help their students in many ways, including creating networking events for career advancement, hosting speakers and workshops to increase educational opportunities, and fostering increased diversity in engineering. These organizations should be receiving significant support from AS, yet I have seen that many of these clubs do not know much about AS or the ways it can serve them, and this needs to change. I think these issues also tie into each other as well, as many organizations serve to create community and connections within engineering, and are perhaps the best-positioned groups to push for greater mental health awareness and support. Through these groups, and new and continuing initiatives in AS, I think significant progress could be made in addressing mental health within a college that sometimes seems to normalize certain issues with the idea that they just come with engineering.","I think experience in numerous engineering clubs, particularly in leadership positions, has prepared me the most for being a senator. As Publicity Chair for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) branch at UCSB, I have seen how one of the largest engineering orgs on campus operates, and I have seen firsthand how these orgs work to help engineering students with both career opportunities and educational efforts to complement in-class learning. This position also lets me interact with a large number of undergraduate students in the College of Engineering, and I have been able to learn what many of their goals and needs are. Another experience that has helped prepare me is serving as the Corporate Relations Chair for Engineers Without Borders; from this role I was able to learn more about some of the ways that AS currently supports engineering orgs, and the processes for receiving funding and how it is allocated. From a more general perspective, working as the Treasurer for the Regent’s Scholars Association has helped me gain an understanding of managing a budget for a student organization, albeit a much much smaller one than the AS senate. Being involved in RSA and EWB has also allowed me to connect with many engineers in majors outside my own, where I have been able to hear about their experiences with the college and their respective struggles, along with some of the organizations they are involved in.","The bills I would like to introduce while in office will naturally be centered on my platform. First, a bill to create and expand a College of Engineering focused division of the mental health task force in order to better connect with and develop awareness events for engineering seems like a critical task to help a lot of students. Second, I think creating a committee, or at least a regular meeting, that brings together AS and the leaders of engineering organizations in order to hear their needs and what they require, while also informing them what AS can do to serve them,  is another crucial step for helping engineering students the best AS can. Finally, I think creating either an engineering-focused mental health town hall, or at least a mental health focused office-hours/increased attention, within engineering spaces would be an amazing thing to see in the next year.","My platform focuses on increasing support for organizations in engineering that already support students, while also pushing for an increase in mental health awareness and creating more resources for engineers. I have seen that clubs on campus often have the greatest connection to companies, and create the most career-advancement and educational opportunities on campus for engineers. They also seem to lack significant communication with AS, and should really be getting more support. These organizations also provide some of the best support for greater diversity in engineering, and often serve groups that are under-represented in the field. Turning to mental health, there is a significant amount of unhealthy standards that have almost been “normalized” in engineering; people go through tremendous amounts of stress and experience a lot of mental health issues, often without much support, and it’s something that must change. I believe increasing mental health resources and awareness in engineering, and the university as a whole, will really help people. This can be addressed through awareness events centered around engineers, collaboration with entities such as engineering organizations and the mental health task force on campus, and a push for more mental health support to be directed to engineers","To achieve my platforms, I first plan on working with career-focused engineering organizations on campus; they already do very well in serving engineers, and could benefit significantly from AS support. They are also excellent entities for promoting mental health awareness in engineering, as they already work closely with students and have a direct connection with them. Continuing on the subject of mental health awareness, the mental health task force in Health and Welness seems to be an excellent entity to begin the work of promoting mental health awareness within engineering. I also think that engineering organizations for specifically underserved communities (such as Society of Women Engineers), are excellent organizations to work with for the continued push for greater diversity in engineering, and deserve continued support from AS. ","I think with the number of ways to connect right now, it would be no challenge making myself available; I think having a Facebook profile for the Engineering Senator position would allow people to easily connect with any concerns, especially since it could easily be promoted to many clubs on Facebook, as well as released through an email to the ugrad engineering email list. For people without Facebook, I think having an available email and Zoom office hours would be an efficient way to handle any concerns, and create a way for constituents to contact me.","I believe that my experiences at UCSB, both within engineering and outside of it, along with my drive to create change and desire to advocate for others, makes me the best candidate. Being a computer engineering major, I have been in the same clubs, classes, and events as CS, CE, and EE majors, allowing me to understand many of the experiences, needs, and struggles of three of the five engineering majors on campus. Serving on the board of IEEE at UCSB and participating in major-related clubs has allowed me to further understand the needs of the students, and to learn how campus organizations function. Working in RSA and Engineers Without Borders has let me connect with more engineers, especially outside of CE, and also shown me even more for how AS can better support the orgs that already best serve the students on campus. Additionally, holding leadership positions in both RSA and Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity has shown me how to work well with people outside of engineering, a skill that is invaluable for best-representing the interests of engineers in the senate.",Left-leaning,very good.   ,"While I agree that alleged humans-right violations committed by Israel are something that should be addressed, and that Israel’s occupation and policies regarding Palestine deserve attention, I can not say that the BDS movement is the way to address this. The Israel-Palestine conflict is already a controversial and complicated issue, and the BDS movement seems to be no less complex, and equally as controversial.","Yes. I believe that, in an ideal situation, the pursuit of higher-education would be provided to every generation regardless of their economic means or background. While I believe this is something that can be achieved in our lifetime, our current system in the United States means that this is not possible. Based on the current structures in place, I believe that requiring tuition from students able to pay it, and distributing financial aid to those who can not, does allow the university to serve as many people as possible.","No, I do not believe that current mental health services at UCSB are totally adequate; college students currently experience some of the greatest instances of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues of any demographic. In engineering majors in particular, I have seen not only the worst effects of the mental health burden that such an intense workload places on students, but that it has also become normalized and is considered “just a part of being an engineer.” While the university does deserve credit for the work done by both CAPS and the Health and Wellness Department, the issue of mental health in universities is too large to currently be addressed by these departments alone. I believe that expanding the CAPS office would be a good first step towards better mental health services, as it can often take months to get an appointment for a therapist, far too long for something as critical as mental health. After this step, an expansion of access to mental health services within engineering, and efforts to educate and dispel current misconceptions within the college would be something I’d love to see.","Yes, the university could have handled the situation better. While it was a difficult situation for the university to address, their communication with the community in the immediate wake of these incidents was largely insufficient, leaving many students frustrated and feeling that not enough action was taken. In fairness, some of the longer term solutions were a step in the right direction, as new rules and accountability systems being implemented for fraternities was something long overdue, and the town halls that were held seemed productive in giving students a voice. However, many students are not aware that there were changes put in place within fraternities, and to some it seems that there were almost no repercussions at all. Moving forward, I hope the university could improve its communication with the UCSB community, and work to ensure that students know the steps they take when dealing with serious issues like these.","Yes, I believe the system does do many things well in terms of guaranteeing that students' voices are heard and that the university takes action. While it does have flaws and areas to be improved, proposed changes from the current presidential administration in the White House are a serious threat to Title IX as it currently stands. I think previous administrations interpretations of Title IX did much better to ensure safety and equality for all groups, including transgender people and victims of assault, and, despite certain flaws, need to remain in place. New proposals are at risk of hurting transgender people’s ability to express their identity, make it much harder for assault to be addressed by a university, and make the process of reporting assault much harder for victims. I believe these proposals are what need to be addressed first and foremost, as they have a significant possibility of hurting students in our community and elsewhere in the near future.","While I can not speak to the experiences of all underrepresented groups at UCSB, within engineering there has definitely been a large effort to push for more representation, in both UCSB and the field as a whole. This is amazing to see, but there is still much work to do, particularly in engineering, a field that has historically lacked diversity. I think many of the current scholarships, research opportunities, and events that primarily serve underrepresented groups are great steps taken by the university to serve students currently underrepresented in engineering, and, given that many of the issues that lead to lack of diversity in engineering stem from greater systemic issues, UCSB does seem to be doing a good amount to serve these students. One of the avenues I see as having the greatest potential for allowing the university to better serve students is in engineering clubs and organizations on campus, specifically ones for underrepresented students. I think the fact that these orgs are composed of and led by specifically students from underrepresented groups allows them to best serve these individuals, and should be seen as an area for growth.",I hope question 3 covers this if that’s okay.,"I agree strongly with the sentiment that AS is not known to many students, and it is something I feel is particularly true for engineering students on campus. In terms of steps to combat the lack of connection between students and AS, I think that a good first step would be to increase the interaction between on-campus orgs and AS, as I have seen that most on-campus orgs, which could often benefit by working with AS, have little knowledge about AS or what they do. This is a particularly strong option for increasing engagement because these clubs are already made up of members that are interested in being involved on campus in some capacity, and are likely to be more receptive to hearing about AS and the work they do. Next, I think that specifically spreading information about AS to engineering students about any work that they are doing that could involve or affect them would be a good step. This could either be done through mass emails to the CoE mailing list, or through weekly tabling/ flyers in engineering spaces (I think emails would be more effective). ","In the most immediate future, the Coronavirus crisis will likely still be an important and ongoing issue; this will necessarily be one of the greatest immediate priorities. Looking at more consistent and long-term priorities, creating a greater dialog and being more open to listening to the needs of both undergraduate and graduate students is something that should be prioritized. There is a significant sentiment that Janet Napolitano does not listen to students, especially with the ongoing COLA strike and firing of graduate students at UC Santa Cruz. I also think that mental health should be something the whole UC system pays more attention to than it currently does, and the proposed Title IX changes coming from the Trump administration should be something the UC’s push back against. Both of these issues are significant to the health of students, and effectively handling them will allow the next UC President to help a lot of students throughout the UC’s.",,,,,,,
Daniel Mitchell,katherine,CCS Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daniel-Mitchell-CCS-Senator-Candidate_.jpg,,,2nd,CCS Music Composition,,,"I am running for the 71st Senate to represent CCS in a meaningful way. CCS has lacked representation in Senate these past few years, and I am trying to change that, not only filling this seat, but also using this as an opportunity to encourage other CCS students to run for AS positions and join BCUs as general members. I am also running to represent artists in AS. UCSB is blessed to have one of the most artistically inclined and creative student bodies. So many students I have talked to either sing, play an instrument, or create works of visual art. Students deserve different ways to present their art to the rest of the school or seek out other artists. I have used my position on the finance and business committee to fund many activities and exhibitions organized by artists, whether it’s acapella groups, dance ensembles, or visual artists. I intend to continue this work.
","I have served as CCS senator for most of the 2019-2020 school year. As Senator, I have served on the finance and business committee, approving and negotiating funding for different student groups and BCUs. I have also served as a Liaison for IV arts and the Zero Waste committee, reflecting my preference for working on artistic and environmental justice issues. Previous to my time on the senate, I was an active member in the UCSB Campus Democrats. As part of Campus Democrats, I canvassed for multiple local politicians such as representative Salud Carbajal and Supervisor Joan Hartmann, and registered students to vote throughout Isla Vista. I am excited to continue my work as CCS senator and continue my work.","Revamp the CCS Student council​: I would write a resolution calling on CCS to reaffirm the powers of the student council, and for each CCS department head to appoint one student to the council. Every May, each CCS department will pick a student representative for the next term by having the students vote. As CCS senator it is my responsibility to chair the CCS student council, but it has been inactive over the past few years. Therefore, it is my responsibility to pass this resolution and get to work.
- IV helping hand Bill: Isla Vista is often intertwined within UCSB affairs, because a lot of students live, eat, shop, study, and party there. A lot of our work involves the IV community, and AS elected members should consider themselves as unofficial stewards of IV public safety. This is why I’m proposing a bill that will obligate every elected member of AS to spend one night each quarter volunteering with CSOs in Isla Vista. This volunteer work will consist of passing out snacks and water, helping incapacitated students, and if need be, walking students who feel unsafe home. This quarterly volunteer work will be tied to honoraria.
- Bill establishing a secretary of general members: AS is operated by unelected student workers who accomplish a lot for AS and the student body. These responsibilities range from lobbying on behalf of the students with LobbyCorps or operating campus events with the Program Board. My bill will establish an executive position that represents general members and advocates for their needs to AS leadership and school faculty. The Secretary of general members will be elected by the entire student body during the AS elections in April and will start operations in the 2021-2022 school year.
","My Platform is all about giving a voice to CCS students and boosting our involvement is campus-wide affairs. In my platform statement I state that my main goal is to see more CCS students run for the CCS seat, as well as other Senate seats (on-campus, off-campus, etc...) and executive positions. I also intend to get more CCS students involved in our BCUs, and apply their talents to their work in AS. I also state that I want to use the powers of AS to organize and carry out events that showcase the work CCS students accomplish.
","IV arts​: I am currently a Liaison to IV Arts in the AS senate. I plan on continuing my work with them organizing and carrying out different events in Isla Vista catering to
    
artists and creators.
- Public Safety Commission​: I intend on working with the Public Safety commission to
help implement and operate the IV helping hand Bill, where AS elected officials help CSOs on weekend nights. Having leadership and general members in the Public Safety commission help out would also be a great outcome.
- Environmental affairs board​: Environmental justice has always been a special concern for me, and there is a shared concern for environmental degradation and climate change among CCS students. I hope to get CCS students involved in local environmental initiatives with the help of the Environmental affairs board.
- Global Gaucho Commission​: A significant number of CCS students are international students, so I intend on working with the Global Gaucho commissio
","If Fall Quarter is online, I will adapt my accessibility to online format. I have already changed my office hours to online form, and I will communicate the changes through my Facebook page. What I have set up is a combination of phone and zoom meetings. I will still reserve 3 hours per week for office hours, but they will be remote, where constituents can call, or set up a zoom meeting ahead of time. As for meetings, AS Senate is currently conducting them through Zoom, and I will notify my constituents what bills and resolutions I introduce beforehand on my facebook page.","If Fall Quarter is online, I will adapt my accessibility to online format.

We have gotten a lot accomplished in the 70th Senate. As senators, we have used our offices to promote the interests of students, support striking grad students, fund the activities of student groups, and keep our BCUs running efficiently. I would also say that we have transitioned to online COVID-19 format quite well.","No. This decision was difficult for me, because I believe that Israel is not respecting the human rights or sovereignty of Palestinians. But I believe that the BDS movement is not the way to go, as it would economically hurt Israeli citizens. I am Jewish and I have family in Israel, so I don’t want to see them hurt. I also don’t believe that school entities should be commenting on this complicated issue. I would instead urge my fellow students to call your local representative and senator, and pressure them to support a just two-state solution that grants full sovereignty and civil rights to Palestinians
","Yes. I would like to clarify that a tuition free UCSB is an imperative ​long-term goal​. What we should focus on over the next few years is expanding pell grants and scholarships, all while increasing funding to the UC system in order to bring down tuition costs. Free Public college is a major accomplishment, so that requires an unprecedented amount of activism from students, parents, and educators on a state and national level. But I do believe that if we pressure our politicians to support a tuition free UC, we can get real results.
","We do not have adequate mental health services on campus currently. Despite the presence of services on campus, namely CAPS, students still report having mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. CAPS does good work with the limited amount of staff they have, but their main problem is wait times. I have talked to students who have had to wait months for an appointment. If you’re having nervous breakdowns, or severe depression you don’t have months to wait. My solution is expanding CAPS and adding more staff. Specifically, CAPS should recruit student volunteers who can relate to their peers in a way that others can’t. Putting one CAPS representative in each residence hall might be a worthwhile idea, as certain mental health concerns may arise from dorm living, especially with students who have social anxiety or OCD. Another idea I have is for CAPS to work in conjunction with the IV clinic, establishing mental health services in Isla Vista. Students living in IV are subject to certain mental health problems that arise from tenant issues, food insecurity, and financial conflict.","The university could have handled the situation better. Sexual assault/harassment is never an easy subject to address, but it is expremely important to preverve our public safety. The problem students had with the school response is that it seemed too little, too late, especially because the fraternity that had been committing the acts had been reported before, but to no avail. I will give the school credit for their eventual crackdown and the sexual assault town hall they held, but it would have been nice to see swift action. If (god forbid) this situation happens again, the school should suspend all activities in the accused fraternity until an official investigation has been held, and if the fraternity has been found to have allowed sexual assaults to happen under their, they need to be shut down.","Title IX is a piece of landmark legislation that has undoubtedly helped victims of
sexism and sexual violence on college campuses. Title IX is also a piece of legislation that was passed in 1972 when knowlege of sexual assault was much different than it is today. The biggest discovery we have made pertaining to sexual assault is that there is no one-size-fits all approach to addressing it. There are many variables, such as age, gender identity, possible mental illnesses, and immigration status that can have an effect on a case. sexual assault response should be handled with these variables in mind. A victim who is undocumeted, for example, should be able to report a sexual assault without fear of being deported. Or, a victim with severe PTSD following the assault should have a specific type of investigation, so they don't have to relive the experience of their assault.
","I do believe that UCSB is acceptably serving historically underrepresented groups and that tireless work ought to be recognized. That being said, there is always room for improvement. I would never presume to speak for any marginalized group, so I will speak from observation. One area the school has successfully served queer students and students of color is through AS and the coutless student organizations dedicated to providing a gathering place for people of many different identities. An area the school must improve on is the treatment of students of color by campus law enforcement. While we have a generally good relationship with campus police, there have been incidents where students of color have felt profiled by officers. I would argue that our biggest issue is with physically disabled students. Our disability infrastructure, specifically elevators, are aging and breaking down, cutting off disabled students from accessing important parts of the school. We must invest in our basic ADA equipment to serve the needs of disabled students.","My first piece of legislation would be the re-building of the CCS Student Council. One of the college-specific jobs of the CCS Senator is to chair the CCS Student Council. The only problem, however, is that the council has been inactive the past few years. My legislation will be a resolution calling on the College of Creative Studies to reaffirm the powers of the student council, and each department chair to appoint one student per department for a partial 2020-2021 term. As chair of this council, I will hold one meeting every quarter where each student representative reports on the affairs and business of their
major. During these meetings, we will write and pass legislation pertaining to the student needs of CCS. During May, I plan on organizing small-scale elections within CCS where the students from each major select a representative for the 2021-2022 term. I hope whoever follows in my footsteps as CCS senator continues this work.","AS absolutely needs to be more accessible to the average student, and I will work extensively with my other senators to make that happen. I will communicate to my constituents what legislation I have accomplished and what I am currently working on through my facebook page, and I will better inform the CCS students and other AS members on how they can reach me. Lack of accessibility is actually something that affects my constituency. CCS students are notably underrepresented in AS and I plan on making steps to boost CCS student participation more, like promoting different BCUs to the college population and recruiting students (in a nonpartisan manner) to run for all sorts of elected positions in AS.","The next president of the UC system must make the basic needs and financial matters of their students their priority, while also paying TAs and other staff members livable wages for their hard work. One of the biggest hurdles students have to overcome is financial stress: being able to afford textbooks and tuition while also finding money for rent and food. Or having to juggle a part time job with homework and class. The next president should come up with solutions to expand free basic-needs distribution to alleviate that stress. This includes expanding food banks, providing free sanitary products and toiletries, and increasing the budget for on-campus healthcare centers. TAs/graduate students are some of the most hardworking people on UC campuses, and they deserve to be recognized for their hard work. Therefore, the next president must make an effort to treat them like proper employees and pay them a living wage for their work. Every leader of a large organization has a long-term vision. I want our next president’s long-term goal to be making the UC system tuition-free. This means tirelessly working to increase funding for the UC system, and extending pell grants and scholarship opportunities. While a tuition-free UC system is definitely not something we can have right away, it is a great goal for our state, and to have
the president of the UC system support that goal would be a huge step forward in that struggle.",,,,,,,
Ahura Simon Nezhand,katherine,Transfer Senator,Campus United,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ahura-_Ahu_-Simon-Nezhad-Transfer-Senator-Candidate.jpg,,,3rd,Psychological and Brain Sciences,,,"UC Santa Barbara is amongst the most globally recognized universities, particularly because of the significant impact that our faculty and student body make on the world. Present-day gauchos will go on to keep their presence in top tier institutions and eventually become the nation’s elites and role models. I happen to believe that such a highly consequential establishment must reach its peak efficiency by offering resources and their corresponding opportunities to ALL students, despite their socioeconomic and academic status. I am deeply outraged by the thought of that transfer who couldn't save lives as a physician just because he didn't feel included in UCSB, that girl who couldn't lead our nation as a president just because she wasn't looked-after when she was preyed upon, and other geniuses who live among us and yet can’t show their true academic potential due to lack of motivation. I acknowledge that there are various factors leading to every problem that each gaucho is facing, and they each deserve solutions that consider these unique factors. Nevertheless, in order to tailor those solutions, a senator must be driven only by one factor, and that is a stirring and ungovernable passion and struggle for the community. This intractable dedication is the reason behind my senate campaign and why I personally am in this race.
","In less than a year that I've had the pleasure to be part of the UCSB community, I authored the constitution of the Iranian Jewish Club (IJC) as the founding president. The system that I envisioned in the constitution manifested itself as an organization that is empowering this marginalized community by training minority student leaders. I have also directly involved myself with the senate by attending many senate hearings as well as CU party meetings. Campus United is a highly disciplined political party that promotes ideological diversity and student leadership. My time in CU gained me a great deal of collaborative experience while encouraging the rest of the student body to get involved with student government.","My first step as your Transfer senator is to create a recovery committee that is going to address the global pandemic. The effects of this pandemic on the school and the student body manifest itself in two different aspects. One, it is creating a new status quo that is entirely transforming the way we learn, study, engage and frankly live. Two, once this is all over, I am certain that as of today, our system is not capable of recovering and it will be overwhelmed in every way. We do not have a choice but to take the proper measures that will deliver the smoothest transition possible. Today, we face hundreds of IV residents who simply can not afford to pay private landlords for properties that tenants will not be using during the pandemic. We have no objective evidence to say that this situation will end anytime soon, in which case this will affect other hundreds of students who have already signed their lease for the upcoming quarters. This example was only concerned with housing. I have similar concerns when it comes to our post-pandemic social life in IV and academic life at large. Having that said, this taskforce will bring about the complete and appropriate revival that is going to be needed after or while we are experiencing the devastating school shutdown.
Transfer experience can be very challenging, not only do we have to learn the ins and outs of the entire campus but we also have to build necessary relationships in addition to fulfilling our own career goals, all in a two-year period. The transfer community is very diverse. People come from different backgrounds and as a result we each deal with a unique set of circumstances. Therefore, I don’t expect all transfer students to accomplish all of that in a 2-year period, nor do I believe that they all do. Anyone who understands these challenges, also comprehends that a 2-year housing guarantee does not reflect UCSB’s values on equity. As the representative of the transfer community, I will lobby and utilize every kind of legislative tool to compose a bill that will provide accessible housing for transfers beyond their two years at UCSB.
By the time the majority of Incoming transfers have been admitted to UCSB, most off campus housings are full. I will create appropriate accommodation tools for transfers who want to start with an off campus location as well as transfers who want to transition from on campus housing to an off-campus location. This includes an online platform that will simplify this process.","I am providing a substantive and issue-oriented platform that is solely concentrated on student demands and needs and corresponding solutions in the form of vital resources. My platform leaves no room for polarization nor for class-blind accommodations that undermine the values we share. I will work with other senators who share the same goals to create legislation that will satisfy my constituency’s interest as well as theirs. I am also looking forward to implementing my vision into programs that already exist, through reform and expansion. As an example, as a senator, I will expand the GUIDES Transfer Summer Orientation (GTSO) program to provide vital resources and campus knowledge to first-generation and low-income transfer students in addition to the entire incoming transfer body prior to their arrival at UCSB - Efforts include collaborations with the Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) and the Education Opportunity Program (EOP). ","For the sake of my platform, it is essential to constantly involve transfer organizations. They have been engaged with transfer related issues for a long time and they can provide fundamental details as to how we will pragmatically approach each platform talking point. Both TSC as an institute that is constantly interacting with the transfer student body and TSA as an AS entity can help the efficiency of my programs. I am particularly investing in their potential for implementing the Research Initiative Program. Once this is a successful initiative, it will transform the quality of their database as well. This initiative will seek to conduct critical and empirical research on the transfer student body in order to provide scientific speculations and survey data on transfer related issues involving housing, safety, and mental health.","In addition to already being available via email and even phone, as a senator, I will also have daily office hours that will likely be held through zoom. My office will keep its social media presence updated as a way to inform my constituency with the senate meetings. Although online social media outlets such as Facebook and Instagram will be utilized to address questions and concerns in any sort, I will provide confidential online forms that will mobilize my voter base to stay connected and critical while preserving their privacy. Regardless of my daily office hours, I will hold virtual town halls addressing consequential decisions and circumstances.","I was born and raised under a religious theocracy in Iran. Although my Persian heritage and my time in Iran make up such a big portion of my identity, the experience of living in a persecuted Jewish community truly taught me to value legal representation and participation in a government that is for the people. Once I moved to the US, even though I no longer had the same second class status, I found myself in another marginalized community. This community, in particular, is the Middle Eastern community as well as the Jewish community — both of which have caused me to face discrimination. When I arrived at UCSB, I had the opportunity to fight
for this underrepresented community which is why I started IJC (Iranian Jewish Club). In addition to mobilizing minority student leaders, we successfully bridged Jewish institutions such as the Santa Barbara Hillel with the MERC (Middle Eastern Resource Center) in order to empower Jews of color as well as involving the Jewish student body with the MERC. I am willing to go out of my way to advocate for the communities that I care about by closing the gaps that divide us. From my experiences bringing together fragmented communities to my direct collaborations with on-campus organizations, I am here to make UCSB a better place for all students.
",left-leaning,"Very good. The 70th Senate presented a non partisan approach for the most part and one that I am really grateful. There is certainly so much room for improvement and change, especially when it comes to the way we utilize student fees. Otherwise, the current legislators were really cognizant in making policies that will not divide the student body based on our background or social categories but rather based on our needs. I particularly admire senators for communicating with the International Student body and responding to their needs.","No. Unfortunately, the BDS movement is not as simple as it is being addressed in this question. This is a matter of personal importance to many of our fellow students and it has to be tackled with great caution, or else, it may be used as a tool to polarize our campus like it has at other UC schools. Human rights violations must be condemned no matter where they take place and it brings me no joy to say that many US allies violate primary human rights on a daily bases. BDS is not concerned with all the other human rights violators that UCSB can potentially divest from, but the state of Israel. Although I respect the intention behind
the movement, as of today, I can not favor this resolution while Gay men are being executed in Saudi Arabia simply for attempting to be who they are.","Yes. If a legislation at the federal level does it with appropriate amounts of funding, absolutely. This is why I have publicly endorsed the College for All Act that would nationally provide around $50 billion to eliminate college tuition for all universities. Otherwise, It has to be done in a way that it won't force us into compromising our faculty and staff’s pay.","I think our faculty and staff at all UCSB mental health services do an amazing job, and I personally appreciate and support their dedication on keeping CAPS open virtually, at these stressful times when thousands of students are in self-quarantine. However, I would have only suggested more publicity initiatives such as the first Mental Health Town Hall that took place last January, but CAPS, on its own, already does not have the capacity to provide routine therapy sessions to students. I believe if we are able to create more locations for CAPS, we can both satisfy a broader array of demands and be more accessible in different locations within the entirety of the community at large.","This was not the first time this particular fraternity was accused of such a charge and, unfortunately, the mentioned fraternity's own National Executive Office was quicker at suspending their chapter’s operation than the school itself. So of course, not only do I believe that the allocated response was not proportionate, but I also think that the school can never respond in a perfect manner solely. In my opinion, school officials, law enforcement, Greek life organizations, survivors, press and the public should have been participating in the process from the beginning. I would like to work with the UCSB Safer Social Events Taskforce to work with administration directly, in order to shift the culture in Isla Vista.","I believe that Title IX has been a successful tool to investigate sexual assault allegations in the community. However, as I mentioned earlier, transparency is key to these processes. I think Title IX needs to be respondent to the whole community as soon as they facilitate an investigation so that way, we will have different qualified members of the community to be part of the solution making process. Currently, we do not have an eligible alternative system for Title IX. Hence why I believe we have to constantly communicate with them to increase their efficiency.","UCSB’s Associated Students has done a phenomenal job of being a champion for marginalized peoples. Their commitment to representing and improving the status of minority and LGBTQI students is an amazing display of bipartisanship. Nevertheless, I think the rest of the school, including the administration, needs to step up to provide more resources that will promote inclusivity off campus as well as on campus. This way, we can further advance the position of queer and color students.
","It is no secret to anyone that the transfer housing communities are mostly located on the outskirts of Isla Vista and face many different challenges such as safety hazards, shortage of availability and the lack of convenient and diverse food options, just to name a few. Hence why I am currently authoring a resolution that will include a Research Initiative Program tailored for transfer communities - This Initiative will perform empirical research on the transfer student body, in order to provide scientific speculations and accurate data on transfer related issues, involving, housing, safety and mental/physical health. AS already contains a system to address transfer related issues through TSA and they have done a great job. However, I happen to believe this research initiative will significantly support their great efforts by providing a better comprehension of the transfer student body.","This is indeed a very fair question, since in opinion, AS actually does become more out of touch after every election. Today we witness Senators contributing to their community and delivering campaign promises for the whole term, but fail to keep their ties with the student body that knows the communal needs better than anybody else. There are many grassroots groups and think tanks in our community that consists of many average gauchos with the necessary skills to identify problems and introduce adequate solutions, in the most professional manner. The student body is our most valuable resource and we can solve a variety of issues if we stay in touch. Just to cite an example for the sake of clarification, recycling has been an ongoing issue in Isla Vista and at the transfer communities, if were to communicate with internal organizations such as Greeks Go Green or the Sunrize Movement SB, through AS’s Environmental Affairs Board (EAB), we can overperform in regards to environmental matters by expanding our team to involve average community members who were qualified enough to participate in these constructive initiatives. On my end, I feel obligated to stay in contact with my constituency and the broader public through the press. On far too many occasions, policymakers have not been taken seriously or able to pragmatically carry out their vision, only due to their disconnection from their voter base. I am planning to utilize the internal press in order to keep our community informed and mobilized. Of course this vision is far from reality, unless media outlets such as Nexus and Bottom Line keep up with their populist transparency initiatives.","I can confidently state that the upcoming presidency is going to be the most crucial term UCSB has ever seen to itself. We have encountered several serious natural phenomena in the past two years and now our student body is struggling with a global pandemic and a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) strike and movement that is currently on hold. Therefore, an issue oriented presidency is essential to the vitality of our community for the next year. We need a future president that will create a recovery committee to address the detrimental effects and help support students after the devastating health hazards and the communal and school shut down. All of the necessary suspensions due to the pandemic may have distracted some attention from the COLA strikes, nevertheless, this can not be an end to a very real problem that our graduate students are facing. With that being said, I will warn and urge the next president to take more pragmatic measures, unlike President Napolitano who had not.",,,,,,,

Anusikha Halder,katherine,On Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Anusikha-Halder.jpeg,,she/her/hers,1st,English,,,"I’m running to be a senator because I believe that UC Santa Barbara has so much potential to be a space where every single student can thrive, and feel like their culture, background, and perspective is heard, represented, and appreciated. But there is so much work to be done in order to make sure that happens.  I want to be a part of making sure that A.S follows through on all of the plans and promises that have been made- and continue to be made. I know that the senate has made so much progress and taken so much initiative to enact meaningful change. A lot of strides have been made to support students of color, who are low-income, who deal with mental health issues, food insecurity, who are in the LGBQT+ community, and/or survivors of sexual assault. 

But as a person who personally lies at the intersection of some of these identities, more actionable solutions and programs need to be created. The student body is still demanding change, and the process for initiating it and following through often feels stagnant. I know I personally have the drive and ambition to push through- and I want to be part of the new push to uplift the student body, and the marginalized voices within. I have a deep love for UCSB- I have grown so much because of the opportunities, resources, and communities I’ve been able to be a part of and access. However, the overarching sense of community and connectivity leaves something to be desired. I haven’t always felt reflected or heard at the upper levels of university workings and procedures. I know other students have felt the same. I’m running to be a senator to actively change that. 
","From the moment I set foot on campus as a first year, I’ve jumped into working on understanding different perspectives, backgrounds, mediating between organizations, and empowering marginalized voices. 

I’ve been writing for UM... Magazine since fall quarter, and working with them since winter quarter. In both capacities, I’ve realized how important taking and making space is, and the transformative impact an org/position can have if their platform centers on uplifting underrepresented minorities. I think a senator’s role is similar- it’s a position that centers on lending volume to the voices of the student body, not just speaking for (or over) them. It’s a delicate balance that UM... has helped teach me. UM has also showed me the multitudes of experiences and backgrounds UCSB students have- and the deep-seated need there still exists for that to be respected, reflected,  and voiced. 

As a Real Talk Facilitator for Santa Catalina, my job is to facilitate difficult discussions on a variety of topics. In the past, I’ve chosen to talk about equity vs equality, sustainability, mental health and how bias affects our day to day lives- and perception of others. Because these issues are so deeply personal, and each person responds to them so differently, the experience has taught me how to be empathetic and grapple with different perspectives and backgrounds. It also has made me understand the power of making space- if you’re trying to serve a group, the best thing you can do is let them advocate for and speak on their own needs, and then use the power and position(s) you possess to fulfill them . 

As a New Leader Intern for Queer Commission, my job centered on community outreach and talking to different groups and communities to see how QComm could better serve them, which I feel directly parallels the role of a senator. I learned how to work with administration, mediate between groups, recognize problems plaguing communities on campus, and problem-solve effectively and quickly. And my experiences and frustrations personally as a queer woman of color and discussing them with the QTPOC community has equipped me to know the importance of the resources and power a senator has, and what I can do given the position.
","Three resolutions or bills I’d like to introduce is a resolution in support of inclusive LGBQT+ housing, a resolution in support of making fraternity leaders mandatory reporters of suspected sexual misconduct under Title IX, and a resolution in support of expanding walk in/brief assessment hours at CAPS (and increasing the staff/trainees required to undertake this). 

LGBQT+ housing is an incredibly pressing issue, especially as Lavender Living is not being properly utilized, and the living units are separated. There are QTs who these units would be vital for, and yet they are going unfilled. On the other hand, for on campus specifically, Manzanita is the only resident hall with single stall shower facilities- and there are no LGBQT+ LLCs that have programming and activities reflective of the community. 

The resolution in support of making fraternity leaders mandatory reporters of suspected sexual misconduct under Title IX directly draws from one of the demands UCSB Intersectional Feminists made. I think it’s an important resolution because it reflects the growing frustration many members of the student body feel regarding the transparency and communication of fraternities in light of the recent sexual assault cases. It is because fraternities are meant to be communities of support, guidance and leadership that it is vital fraternity leaders are made mandated reporters. This holds Greek life organizations accountable,  and is a step towards eliminating the culture of complacency and patterns of behavior rooted in the prevalence of sexual assault at UCSB. 

Increasing walk in hours/brief assessment accessibility will help further de-stigmatize seeking help for mental health by allowing more students to pursue that course of action. Furthermore, many students get discouraged by being turned away initially and never return to seek the help they truly need. Increasing the staff that is able to conduct brief assessments will allow students to get that help, as well as allow CAPS to diversify the offerings of programs and therapy sessions, and make them more reflective of groups whose mental health is most impacted. 
","My platform is centered on making resources more accessible, empowering organizations and student voices, and increasing transparency and communication between the student body and administration. I will work to achieve my goals of empowering underrepresented communities by working directly with their representative organizations to see what they need. I also plan on following through on previous A.S resolutions in support of de-stigmatizing mental health, and of rolling over swipes. I firmly believe that the best thing I can do is collaborate with those around me and connect people- UCSB is a community, and I want my impact to be that people feel part of it, and supported by it. 

If I am elected, I plan on immediately setting into motion initiatives the student body has been already pushing for, such as encouraging the creation satellite locations of CAPS to help with mental health services accessibility, and talking to CAPS about providing workshops and programs reflective of the groups most impacted by mental health in college and creating trainings for the Mental Health Peers reflective of the cultural complexities that come with those lived experiences. 

I also want to push for food security by connecting Dining Services with the A.S Food Bank, and Swipes UCSB (and possibly involve RHA) to discuss increasing (or eliminating entirely) the cap on donated swipes, and allowing students with 17 swipes or less to roll over swipes- allowing both students and Dining Services to cut down on food waste and save money. Food insecurity is such a huge stressor, that I really want to push on making the support for these ideas A.S has already shown manifest into the services promised/discussed. 

In general, I want to work alongside orgs and institutions  like RHA, CARE, the RCSGD, the MCC, DSP, and student led groups to update trainings and workshops already required and provided to be inclusive and better reflective of the lived  experiences of underrepresented groups on campus. I also want to work with these institutions to push for things like LGBQT+ inclusive, safe, stable housing, and support for making ASL lessons more accessible to students (which are currently only provided through Recreation). 

Finally, I think communication and transparency is important. I want to help bring organizations together- and make sure we’re holding others accountable. I know I personally will communicate every course of action I’m taking on if I’m elected (as projects develop). However,  I also want to increase transparency for the administration, like demanding UCSB go beyond the Clery Act and provide a daily log, a quarterly report, and explain the circumstances of cases and the results (within the bounds of confidentiality). 
","In regards to food security, I hope to work with UCSB Housing, Dining & Auxiliary Enterprises,  the A.S Food Bank, and UCSB Swipe Out Hunger.  I know the A.S. Food Bank has already been working with Campus Dining  to try to increase the cap on the number of swipes students can donate per week- but the process has been slow. About 48% of the student body (with first and second years particularly hit hard) face food insecurity. These 3 orgs/entities have had the most impact on student access to food and I hope to work with them to ensure students save money, are able to get the food they need to survive, and cut down on food waste. 

For  improving mental health services and support, I hope to work with CAPS and the Mental Health Peers to extend walk-in hours and available people to work with students, as well as creating more programs designed to address communities like LGBQT+, people of color, QTPOC, and survivors of sexual assault and harrasment, as these communities come with their own cultural complexities that are intrinsically interwined with mental health. Those complexities need to be better addressed. 

For improving programs for the college transition and updating trainings/workshops, some institutions and organaizations I hope to work with the RCSGD, CARE, Students Against Sexual Assault, and cultural orgs (UCSB Indus, Black Student Union, Nikkei Student Union as a few examples), as well as queer cultural orgs like La Familia, Undocuqueer/Undocutrans, and Black Quare. While UCSB has done a good job of updating workshops and trainings, so much of the information presented does not accurately reflect or take into consideration the experiences of students who are survivors of sexual assault, LGBQT+, undocumented, low-income, disabled, immunocompromised, POC, struggling with mental health issues- or how the ramifications of how these identities can intersect. Working with the institutions and organizations that encompass these communities will allow workshops and programs centered on educating other students on these issues to be reflective of what these students need and want, and the issues they actually face. ","If the shift to online courses continues, I plan to still follow through on all the ways I plan on making myself accessible- i.e making a public facebook page with updates and resources, holding office hours, hosting virtual AMAs, and sending out google form progress checks and check ins. The primary difference would be that my office hours would be virtual (likely conducted on Zoom, as I know that is the most common video conferencing application students have, as a result of it being the primary platform for online classes) , and that my attendance of town halls (if they continue) would also be virtual. I would also use those check ins to see how my constituents were coping with the online transition, and what they would want to see set in motion for when they return to campus after fall quarter. I would try to be as transparent as possible about the work I was doing- the plans I was making, and the things I was discussing with institutions and organizations. For example, if I met with the Food Bank and Swipe Out Hunger UCSB to discuss how to increase the cap on donated swipes, I would post an update about meeting with them for that purpose. ","My background and experience is in mediation, facilitation, and community outreach- all of which fits what the position of on campus senator requires. I also recognize the diversity of experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds UCSB students have, and would do my best to recognize and serve them. I know what it’s like to feel like your communities or identities are being overlooked or dismissed. Being a senator would allow me to talk to student groups I normally don’t have access to or contact with, and make sure their needs are met- this is something I’m passionate about, and is at the core of this position. 

As a first year, I’ve already started advocating for communities and UCSB students. While it’s been postponed due to COVID-19, I was working with the library to create a student-curated collection of LGBQT+ works that would be made more accessible to students. I was also working on conducting a Mental Health Town Hall for the LGBQT+ community. Because I helped plan and lead the delegation for the Queer Trans People of Color Conference, as well as help plan Pride (before it was cancelled) and so I’m well versed in what it takes to communicate with different groups and individuals with a variety of needs and expectations, adapt quickly as situations change, and the work it takes to ensure a program or workshop goes well. 

I’ve grown a lot as a leader and facilitator through my experiences these past two quarters. I know I have the skills, drive, and initiative necessary to follow through on the resolutions I pass, and the issues I see as most pressing on campus. These are issues that have been brought up time and time again- food insecurity, the inaccessibility of mental health services, and the need to better reflect underrepresented communities on campus. We’re at a tipping point, and I believe I can push (along with the rest of A.S Senate and the help of orgs and boards) UCSB in the right direction.  I also know that what a lot of the student body feels about senators is that they feel inaccessible, or they don’t know what senators are doing/focusing on. I recognize that disconnect and work to make sure I was transparent and communicative with UCSB students at large. I also think that’s vital to knowing what the student body feels needs to be taken care of and addressed first. 
",left-leaning,"Good. Based on Fall 2019, A.S Senate did a good job of passing resolutions regarding important student issues. Much of what was passed also focused on organization and transparency- which is vital. But the climate on campus is increasingly worrying- with food insecurity, mental health, sexual harassment and assault being some of the many pressing issues emerging as prevalent.  A.S Senate has recognized these issues- but we need actionable solutions and pass bills and resolutions that empower the student body and initiate lasting change. And we need to follow through on the resolutions that have been passed. ","Yes. There is much work to do even if a resolution is passed in favor of divesting in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. But voting in favor of divesting would be representative of a desire to invest money only in causes and companies we believe in. A.S Senate’s mission is to use undergraduate fees to empower students with cultural, academic, leadership, employment and growth opportunities. We have a responsibility to ensure student money does not trickle down into the oppression of a group of people- and voting in favor of divesting is a step towards that.  

","Yes. I think the burden of paying graduate students, professors, providing adequate classes, and resources (as well as spaces for orgs and communities to gather) should fall upon the institution itself and the state. There are public and private benefits for everyone if UCSB is tuition free- students would be able to better focus on their studies rather than having to work to make ends meet. As a result, more students may graduate on time, and take on jobs vital to their communities. Students would simply be able to access opportunities on a more equal footing with their more affluent peers. 
","While the mental health services at UCSB are a great resource for students, they are not adequate. I know so many students who have been turned away from walk-in hours simply due to lack of available people to conduct the initial brief assessment. Additionally, there simply needs to be more support for international students (i.e outreach and working with a language barrier). While many resources have been gathered, there simply needs to be more education on what negative mental health can manifest as, and how it looks different for everyone. There are also not enough people trained or reflective of the communities that disproportionately struggle with mental health (as well as stigma and access to services) more- such as  disabled students, LGBQT+ individuals and people of color (and again, those who lie at that intersection). The programs and events that do address this need are not well known- I personally was a part of the True Selves group, the LGBQT+ group therapy, and so many of my peers that I mentioned it in passing to told me that they wished they heard about it.  

I believe more programs and events should be created to reflect the different groups who are most impacted by mental health issues. I know that many of the clinical staff specialize and have interests in survivors of sexual assault, the LGBQT+, Latinx, African American, South-Asian, and Asian students and how their backgrounds impact mental health, but I believe that more people from these backgrounds should be hired. I also think that CAPS and the Mental Health Peers can work with orgs and centers on campus (like all of the resource centers in the Student Resources Building) , to create groups,  programs, events, and guides for communities that take into account and better address their background and cultures. I also think that there are already resources and events that are great but simply not taken advantage of because students do not know about them. This was an issue brought up at the Mental Health Town Hall- and I think increased advertisement and outreach (i.e reaching out to orgs on campus to tell their members about resources and events) will help a lot with this. 
","The response of the university to the reports failed not only those involved, but the student body on every level. The lack of accountability and urgency with which the university addressed concerns and reports highlighted the cultural and institutional complacency on campus that perpertuates sexual assault and harrassment. However, A.S leadership (as well as the Mental Health Town Hall) could have also addressed the situation better in regards to communication and addressing student concerns.  Regarding the university, the administration should have immediately recognized that there were multiple reports, responded to student concerns, and assured us that the cases were being handled. Confidentiality and Title IX is meant to protect reporters and survivors- not allow institutions to cover situations up or ignore them, which is what many students felt happened. 

Additionally, UCPD’s self-defense training, while greatly appreciated, failed to acknowledge trans*, masculine-identifying, non-binary and non-genderconforming individuals. UCPD is working on updating the training now, but it should not have taken these cases and student outrage to do so. The recent case of *alleged* transphobia also parallels the sexual assault cases, and emphasizes more than ever that the culture of Greek life and the attitudes toward cis-women and LGBQTIA+ people needs to be addressed properly. While I recognize the benefits of Greek life, and how much of a resource it can be for so many students, the fact remains that these recent cases reflect a pattern of behavior that needs to be combatted actively.  The fraternities involved need to be communicating with the student body as well- and the university administration needs to push for this, and facilitate that.

 Many students also felt frustrated with the lack of transparency, communication and what appeared to be little result or consequences. The Clery Act may mandate a public safety report, but there needs to be more involvement and updates from the administration. There ought to be a quarterly report (if not a daily log), an addressal of cases, a noting of multiple reports for a particular organization, and the results/consequences (names of parties arranged or removed to fall within the bounds of confidentiality)  published for students. 
","Title IX is a good start but doesn’t address the cultures and practices that perpetuate sexual assault on UC campuses- nor does it empower survivors of sexual assault in their recovery.  Additionally, it doesn’t address the intricacies of dealing with domestic/interpersonal violence, and the mental, emotional, and financial repercussions survivors face. While Title IX is often invoked and used to encourage survivors to report, the above factors (as well as others) are often diminished or dismissed, and result in uncomfortable and unsafe situations. Title IX also doesn’t make it easier to pursue legal action or work with the administration- only with labor from A.S Senate , institutions on campus, administrative labor, transparency, and accountability, as well as proper communication and addressal from involved institutions (like fraternities) will we BEGIN to properly address sexual assault on campus. Title IX in regards to mandated reporters goes only so far as to who is made to be a mandated reporter. Because of the recent sexual violence, fraternity leaders increasingly ought to be made mandated reporters of suspected sexual misconduct.  

Furthermore, within Title IX itself, Title IX compliance is not enough. Title IX investigators need to be trained by former sexual assault investigators, not just consultants who instruct on compliance with guidelines issued by the Department of Education.  Nearly every Title IX campus sexual investigation involves a consent defense that most campus sexual assault investigator are not adequately experienced or trained on to effectively investigate. Nor do Title IX investigators have the proper psychological training to support survivors during the investigation period. This lack of training often results in wasted money, time, and hardship for the parties reporting a Title IX violation, and even the university. And until investigators are properly trained, the student body at large will continue to doubt the integrity and adequacy of Title IX investigations and procedures. 
","I don’t think UCSB is effectively serving these groups. Yes, these groups may have organizations and boards and events on campus- but so much of that is accomplished through student labor. It is so often the members of these groups making sure their communities have safe spaces to organize and meet. And because of the lack of spaces, groups within these communities often feel at odds with each other- when it seems like there’s only one seat at the table, underrepresented groups often feel like they have to fight each other for it- whether that seat is represented through funding, representation, acknowledgement, etc. 

For example, there is a severe lack of LGBQT+ inclusive housing. While Rainbow House exists, Manzanita can feel too disconnected for first years to pursue, and Lavender Living in Santa Ynez is effectively being dismantled as it  is not filled by QT folks who need it ,and there is separation of the living units. The gender neutral floor in San Nicolas has gender neutral bathrooms, but many residents feel that is the extent of the LLC being gender neutral. And while there is an effort made in creating gender inclusive/neutral restrooms, the same cannot be said of shower facilities. 

Another example is that there is no American Sign Language department for deaf students, or students who want to learn to support the deaf community. Instead, ASL is offered through the Department of Recreation (where the price can be an impediment for some students). This is an important resource that should be made more accessible for students. 

I also think the OSL process for registering (or re-registering) organizations needs to be made clearer and easier. For historically underrepresented groups it can be difficult to have the funds for the registration fees- and these groups’ members are often overworked and underpaid, which makes the rigidity of training, workshops, and retreats particularly difficult.  I think the pattern of QTPOC orgs disappearing and then finding it difficult to re-organize and re-register makes this quite clear. 

Finally, I think the pandemic and resulting panic illustrated a lot of deep-seated xenophobia and racism that remains on campus. The university has set forward some programs and events to address this, and the bill to have two international senator positions is a good start, but again- it’s clear campus culture needs to be deconstructed and explored deeper going forward if we’re to adequately support groups on campus that are underrepresented, annd disproportionately dismissed.
","The first resolution I plan to author is one in support of creating sustainable, inclusive LGBQT+ housing and LLCs. While food security is the issue I want to push for most, the resolution regarding donation cap and swipes has already been passed, and so I would be working on following through on that if I was elected. The next pressing thing for me is the housing situation for the LGBQT+ community. The 2nd  Queer Town Hall brought this up as an issue many Queer/Trans students were worried about. In particular, it was brought up that San Nicolas’s gender-neutral floor didn’t feel like it matched other LLCs in regards to relevant programming and activities.

 Others brought up the lack of gender-neutral, single stall shower facilities in resident halls aside from Manzanita. Another concern was the state of Lavender Living, and how many felt it was effectively being dismantled. Senate cannot do this work alone, and there is a lot of bureaucracy and red tape concerning housing, but a resolution in support of safe, inclusive LGBQT+ housing will push for the work on this issue to begin. Furthermore, for many first and second years- the population most likely to live on campus- college is a space and environment that allows them to explore and embrace aspects of their identity they may not have before. Many choose to come out in this time- and as a result, stable, safe, and inclusive housing is an especially important resource to provide. 
","As a senator, the first step I would take is to create a public facebook page where I would list my office hours, contact information, and post resources and updates on events and how the 
Senate is doing.  

I would use my office hours to address any concerns or questions any individuals might have. I also might use my social media to conduct quarterly Reddit style AMAs for students who might not want to (or cannot) meet with me one-on-one but still have questions about the work I’m doing, Senate is doing, my values, policies, resolutions and bills, etc. I’d also like to create a resource guide illustrating what A.S Senators (and A.S Senate as a whole) can help students with, what our job actually entails, and what our mission/values are!

I would do my best to attend town halls (such as  the Mental Health, Sexual Assault, and Queer Town Halls) as these are platforms where everyone is able to voice their opinions and address one another on a relatively equal level. Going to these town halls would be important for me as they touch on issues I deeply care about, and allow me to stay in touch with the student body, how they are feeling, and what they need and want. 

Finally, because I am interested in the on-campus senator position, if elected, I would check in with residence halls and ask RAs, and the Residence and Assistant Residence Directors how their residents were faring and what they were struggling with. Living on campus presents its own unique set of challenges and obstacles, and it’s easy to feel a dissonance in being so close to the workings of campus institutions, but not understanding them. Because that can change quickly and drastically, I want to know what the residents themselves think. If permitted, I would send residents a google form asking what they would like to see and what they had questions on. 
","For the next UC President, I see the top priorities being increasing food security, fair pay for graduate students, accessibility to mental health services, transparency regarding sexual assault and the results of cases, and inclusive, safe, stable housing. These are all issues that have become especially pressing, and the student body will not tolerate these being dismissed or overlooked any longer. 

According to the 2017 Basic Needs Report, about 48% of  UCSB’s student body (with first and second years being most dramatically impacted) face food insecurity of some kind. This kind of level of food insecurity is relatively consistent across the UC system- worse, in some cases.  We cannot allow any student- let alone so many- go hungry. Food insecurity impacts a student’s health, safety, and ability to succeed academically. 

The recent strikes and withholding of grades makes it clear how vital the work of graduate students and TA’s are. The next UC president has to properly address the dismissal of grad students, as well as take steps to make sure they are properly compensated and treated fairly. Students’ academic success so often depends on the support of their TAs- and the UC system currently does not return that support for the TAs. 

College students in general are a population that is particularly at risk for mental health struggles. It’s a result of transitioning to a new environment, and taking on the obstacles and challenges that higher education brings. This can then be compounded by students’ marginalized identities. That’s why it’s important for the next UC president to prioritize making sure every student has equal access to mental health services, and that those services take into account the cultural complexities, pressures,  and stigmas historically intertwined with certain groups’  mental health. 

As sexual harassment and assault continues in the UC system, it becomes clear that the current framework is not sufficient in regards to being preventative or restorative for sexual assault cases. While Title IX is a system that is a start, the culture on campuses, and institutional complacency needs to be addressed by the next UC president before we can hope to give survivors the support they need- or prevent more cases. 

Finally, safe, inclusive and stable housing is a human right that all students should have. While there are measures in place to support students in the event of emergencies, there needs to be better, continuous options for LGBQT+ and/or low income students, for their own wellbeing and safety.

Dania De Ramon,katherine,On Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dania-DeRamon.jpg,,,1st,Pre-Communications,,,"Throughout the past six months, UCSB has truly become my home. I have fallen in love with the beautiful scenery at every turn, met some of my best friends, and had the chance to connect with so many new people and learn about their experiences. There are so many amazing things about our school--the people, campus itself, the BEACH being SO close, the uniqueness of IV culture--but I also think that there’s also a lot that we can do to make our school even better. I completely acknowledge and appreciate the numerous resources we have at our availability and the school’s dedication to diversity and inclusivity, but the university can and should be doing more for their students. Student leaders have a responsibility to look out for the needs of all students on campus and be pushing the university’s administration to do more. It’s so important to make our campus equitable for ALL students. A lot of it starts by funding resources, such as CAPS more, to make them more accessible and taking steps to ensure the basic needs of students are met, by introducing roll over meal swipes and advocating for affordable housing for example. Moreover, the university has a responsibility to look out for and uplift students who are a part of historically underrepresented groups. They need to do more to alleviate financial burdens, make mental health resources more accessible, and ensure that they truly feel like a part of the greater UCSB community. I’m running to be a senator with the 71st senate because I truly believe that we, the students who pay into this school, have the capability of influencing positive change that helps foster an equitable, inclusive, and accessible campus for ALL students.","This past year I had the honor of serving as Santa Cruz Hall Council President. My experience in this position, within hall council and RHA, has challenged me immensely, helped me grow a lot as a person, and helped strengthen my leadership skills. I learned how to effectively plan and run hall council meetings. I was able to create a chill, effective work environment for those in hall council by adjusting things as needed to ensure that those who were a part of hall council maintained interest since many of the positions were voluntary. At the larger scale within RHA, I always kept the interests of those in my residence hall in mind and I also learned about effective ways to deal with the disagreements that sometimes came up during funding requests. I believe my position as Hall Council President has prepared me to be a senator because it has helped me refine my time management skills (the position ranged from ~8-15 hours per week depending on events), taught me to always keep the best interests of my constituents in mind, and encouraged me to become more open to new ideas. I took the time to meet with those in hall council to gather feedback on what could be improved about meetings and what was going well. Most importantly, the position has taught me how to be continuously mindful of the needs of those around me. I think one of the most important qualities a leader needs to have is empathy and I always tried my best to reach out to those who were a part of hall council to check up on how they’re doing.
I was also involved with the Environmental Justice Alliance this year, serving as the Community Affairs Chair. This position helped me strengthen my community organizing skills and challenged me to always consider the spheres of influence all around me. I had the chance to be a part of organizing a climate strike in Isla Vista and a Board of Supervisors candidate forum, as well as create connections to other awesome orgs in the local area organizing to create and influence positive change in the community. I believe the experience I have gained from this position in community organizing has helped prepare to be a senator.","The first resolution I would like to introduce while in office is a resolution in support of placing compost bins in the residence halls. I won’t go into too much detail here because I go over the idea rather thoroughly in a later question, but this resolution would be positional so if it
 
were to pass I hope to work with AS Recycling to implement the idea. This idea is meant to help UCSB take a step towards its zero waste goal.
In order to increase transparency and accessibility to A.S., I would like to introduce a directional bill that creates a quarterly Senate newsletter informing the student body of ongoing projects and bills/resolutions that have been passed. This bill would require updates from every senator on a quarterly basis. I hope to collaborate with A.S. Creative Media Unit to see how we could make it happen if the bill were to pass.
Another resolution I would like to introduce while in office is one in support of establishing a 24-hour response center on campus in order to promote safety. ​There has been a rise in crimes on or near UCSB reported in recent years​. I think ensuring the safety of students is absolutely imperative, but it’s also imperative that they have a space where they feel comfortable and safe enough to receive immediate aid. Establishing a 24-hour response center on campus would create this space for students, as well as promote faster response times on behalf of the university.
I would also like to introduce a resolution in support of creating a peer mentor program dedicated to helping first-year students navigate their freshman year experience. I think it might even be a good idea to make it a bill instead that creates a BCU that’s dedicated entirely to running this program; that would be dependent on the amount of student interest though. If I were to introduce it as a resolution in support of the idea and it were to pass, I would hope to collaborate with other senators and RHA to create a plan on how to establish the program.
","Much of my platform is based on working towards change that will make UCSB more equitable and inclusive for ALL students on campus.
The platform idea I’m most passionate about working on is implementing a system that
allows transferable and roll over meal swipes to combat food insecurity. This past quarter, the Senate ​voted to pass a positional resolution in support of rolling over meal swipes​. The Senate can’t choose to make the switch, so it’s imperative to continue urging and working with the Housing department to ensure that the change is implemented. Approximately ​48% of
 
undergraduates at UCSB face food insecurity​--that’s an unacceptably large number. The priority of student leaders on campus should be to ensure that the basic needs of all students are met. By implementing a system of roll over meal swipes, we are not only fighting food insecurity, but also helping alleviate burdens placed on students and helping them succeed personally and academically. Furthermore, roll over meal swipes would also ensure that the $1000+ students pay for meal plans every quarter doesn’t go to waste and that they get their money’s worth--especially considering meal plans are paid for at the beginning of the quarter.
Another part of my platform is to advocate to make the residence halls more affordable for students. It’s difficult to ignore just how expensive it is to live on campus; the cheapest option for students is a triple with a 10-meal meal plan at ~$15000 for the year. For many students, that rate can be difficult to pay and perhaps forces them to have to take out large amounts of loans to be able to pay it off. Similar to the issue of combating food insecurity, more affordable housing will alleviate financial burdens for students and contribute to their overall well-being.
As I mentioned previously, I based my platform off ideas I believe have the potential to make UCSB a campus that is more equitable and accessible for all students. Some other ideas in my platform are increasing accessibility to CAPS by advocating for more psychologists/peer mentors to reduce wait times, expanding resources for first-generation students, and establishing a peer mentor program that helps first-year students navigate their first year on campus. I plan to work on all these things by authoring bills/resolutions in support, but also by taking direct action and working with the departments/resources in question to help make these things happen.
","In terms of implementing roll over and transferable meal swipes, I hope to work with RHA and the Food Security & Basic Needs Taskforce. RHA is the governing body of the residence halls and I believe that in order to implement this change, it’s crucial to collaborate with them. An idea I had was to work with RHA to create an anonymous survey for residents to share how a roll over meal swipe system would be beneficial to them and then present it to the Housing department and campus dining. Sort of on the same note, I want to mention how important I believe it is to collaborate with RHA to implement a lot of these ideas because they are such a large part of residential life on campus and they’re a great resource to tap into in order to get these things done. Moreover, working with the Food Security & Basic Needs Taskforce would be a good way of getting more concrete information on how food insecurity impacts students, as well as sharing food resources to students in the residence halls.
Furthermore, I hope to work with EOP to expand resources, such as grants and workshops, for first generation scholars. I think it’d be great to work with them in hopes of seeing a larger presence of EOP within the residence halls to ensure students know about resources available to them.
I would hope to work with other senators and possibly the Office of Student Affairs to establish a peer mentor program that pairs upper class students with first-years.
Lastly, I didn’t mention this in the previous question because I go into detail in a later question, but another large part of my platform is placing compost bins into the residence halls. I hope to work with AS Recycling to consider all the logistics of this and make it happen.
","If the shift to online courses continues through summer and fall quarter, I will make myself available to my constituents through virtual means. I would hold virtual office hours on Zoom and advertise those office hours, as well as my email, on my social media so that I could be reached through those platforms. To increase accessibility to my constituents, I would advertise that information both at the beginning of the quarter and around halfway through the quarter. Moreover, I would keep all my social media on a public setting to make myself accessible to a larger portion of my constituents. I am more than willing to set up Zoom/FaceTime/phone calls with a student if they have a concern they would like to talk about. Fulfilling the needs and concerns of my constituents would be my number one priority as a Senator, so I am ready to dedicate as much time as needed to ensuring that happens in an adequate manner. I believe that prioritizing the needs of my constituents is important, but even
more so as we all go through these uncertain and scary times together. I recognize that the circumstances created by the ongoing pandemic can create a number of barriers associated with students’ abilities to fulfill their basic needs and perform to their best in academic terms. Because of this, I believe that it is absolutely crucial to make myself as available as possible within my capacities through virtual platforms to listen to the needs of my constituents, be a resource for them, and help in any way that I can.","I am the daughter of a hard-working, immigrant, Mexican woman who has taught me the importance of resilience through adversity. I come from a mostly working-class, Latinx community that is overburdened with staggering air pollution levels. I am the first in my family to attend college. All of these things, and many more, have shaped me into the person I am today. I’ve grown a lot as a person these past couple of years. I’ve learned about the countless environmental and social injustices that occur in my community on a daily basis. I've had my fair share of anger at the systems of influence that have created these injustices. I’ve learned about the importance of using my voice, and more importantly, my privileges to do my part in fighting for justice for those who have been historically marginalized. I’ve also learned about the importance of compassion and looking out for the well-being of those around me.
Coming to UCSB, I hoped to get involved with organizations that would help me further grow as a person and fight injustices. Through my involvement with hall council and the Environmental Justice Alliance, I learned so much about the UCSB community and got to meet so many amazing people, but I also realized that there were many areas in which the university was failing its students, especially those who come from underrepresented groups. I want to help change that and I am ready to work as hard as I can to make UCSB a campus that works for ALL students.
I am an incredibly determined and dedicated person, especially when it comes to the things and people I care about. I believe that these qualities, my background, my experiences, and my willingness to work my butt off to influence positive change is what makes the best candidate for this position.",left-leaning,"Very Good. Senate has done a very good job of addressing the needs of
students. The resolution they passed supporting the development of a Basic Needs Resource
Center is great--it would help students who may struggle to obtain basic necessities and alleviate
financial burdens. I didn’t put “excellent” because I believe more concrete steps to address
students’ needs could’ve been taken. For example, the resolution that supported reducing the
stigma around mental health issues is great, but I feel Senators could have taken concrete action
by collaborating with RHA to do work within the residence halls to address this issue.","Yes.  ​Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as the rest of humanity. Our actions at UCSB have a lot of influence and I fully believe our student leaders should use their privilege and position to support equal rights for everyone.
","Yes. I firmly believe that higher education needs to be accessible to ALLstudents. Making UCSB tuition-free would make it so historically underrepresented students,especially low-income and first-generation students, are able to attend college, as well asalleviate financial burdens for current and future students. Not having to worry about tuitionwould help students better focus on their academics and have a higher chance of graduating on time.","I believe they are relatively adequate and I think UCSB does a good job of making these services known to students, but there is definitely room for improvement to better accommodate students. I have heard so many people echo concerns about the inaccessibility of C.A.P.S. due to long wait times. To say it bluntly, C.A.P.S. is underfunded and understaffed. According to an article​ in the ​Daily Nexus,​ “there is approximately one C.A.P.S. psychologist for every 967 students​.” C.A.P.S needs more funding, more physical space, and more attention in order to improve mental health services and make them more accessible to students. Personally, I have found myself wanting to go to C.A.P.S. several times, but my class schedule and other time commitments have made it difficult for me to find time to actually go in for an initial assessment. I am sure that this is an issue for many other students who have to juggle both work and academics. Again, it goes back to increasing the amount of funding and attention C.A.P.S receives. In the same article referenced above, it is mentioned that only about 4.5% of student fees (~$82 / student / year) go to C.A.P.S., whereas over 11% of our student fees go to the Rec Cen (~$211 / student / year). I think our student fees need to be readjusted so that C.A.P.S receives more funding and the general student body has more adequate access to C.A.P.S.","I do think that the university could have handled the situation a lot better. When the university originally sent the October 17th timely warning, they did not mention the fraternities involved. The email said there were “two incidents of the use of incapacitating agents (“date rape drugs”) at a fraternity event in Isla Vista.” Many students were concerned over this, myself included. The university should have disclosed the names of the fraternities involved for sake of students’ sense of safety. Naming the fraternities also would have created more accountability. Moreover, some of the university’s safety tips were of victim-blaming nature. One particular tip said: “Alcohol is frequently used to facilitate sexual violence by reducing a person’s ability to respond effectively, impairing memory, and increasing feelings of self-doubt or blame. When drinking, consider your surroundings, be aware of personal limits, and look after friends who appear to be intoxicated.” I understand the university’s intention with this tip, and the others, was to help people stay safe, but I don’t agree with the way it seems to place blame on the victim. In order to more effectively handle sexual assault cases, the university must shift away from a victim-blaming/rape culture and into one that centers survivors.
","As it stands right now, I do not believe that Title IX is a completely adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Our criminal justice system has so many inherent flaws and makes it difficult for survivors to get any sort of justice, especially when ​only one in 20 reported rapes result in a prison sentence​. It is imperative that the UC system offers an adequate system that will give survivors options in how they want to deal with their situation. I believe that the UC’s Title IX policy needs to do more to ensure that survivors feel safe and comfortable enough to report cases to the Title IX office. According to an article in ​The Daily Californian (UC Berkeley’s school newspaper), some of the changes made in 2019 to the UC’s sexual harrasment and sexual violence policy included a ​30-day extension on the deadline to initiate the formal investigation process​. I think that the UC has a responsibility to its students, especially to survivors, to have faster response times when complaints are filed. Lastly, in order to make Title IX a more adeqaute system to address sexual assault, the Title IX offices need to receive more funding, as ​some Title IX officials have called for​ at a UC Regent meeting this past January.","I think UCSB does make an effort to effectively serve historically underrepresented groups; that’s one of the major reasons I chose to attend UCSB. It’s great to have safe spaces like the SRB dedicated for these historically underrepresented groups. However, I honestly believe that UCSB could be doing much more to actually effectively serve these groups. A lot of it goes back to the fact that UCSB needs to lower its tuition fees, or rather be tuition-free, in order to more effectively serve historically underrepresented groups because they are the ones who are most disproportionately impacted by these high fees. Many students who are a part of these groups don’t have the financial means of being able to pay off tuition without having to take out loans or without having to work a job, or even multiple jobs, to be able to just ​attend​ the school. Furthermore, and I know it’s something I already went over in question #5, but UCSB really does need to fund C.A.P.S more in order to better effectively serve these underrepresented groups. For many, it is the first time they even have these types of services available to them and not to mention that many of these students rely on UCSB for healthcare. Having to juggle so many responsibilities may make it difficult to even find time to get and receive these services. I think instead of saying how much they value diversity and inclusivity, UCSB needs to take more action to create ​equity​ for these historically underrepresented groups in order to help them succeed in their academics, ensure that their mental health is being taken care of, and that they are able to graduate on time. Lowering tuition fees would be a great first step in the right direction towards that.","If I am elected to serve on the Senate, the first resolution I plan to author is a resolution in support of implementing compost bins in the residence halls. I believe that this would be a step towards helping UCSB achieve its goal of becoming zero waste. Last quarter I took “The Climate Crisis” with Ken Hiltner and one of the biggest takeaways from that class was that approximately 40% of food produced goes to waste. Moreover, according to ​“Project
Drawdown,”​ “nearly half of the solid waste produced globally is organic or biodegradable.” All of that ends up in landfills and emits methane, which is 34x more potent than Carbon Dioxide and stays in our atmosphere for a much longer time. From 2020-2050, composting has the potential to ​sequester/reduce​ 2.14-3.13 ​gigatons​ of CO2 equivalent. Living in the residence halls this past year, one of the things I noticed is how much food is thrown away and I noticed that in just my floor’s lounge. When we take into account every other floor in Santa Cruz, and every floor in all the other residence halls, I would imagine that there is a lot of food waste being generated. I am in no way blaming students for this, rather I think it would be a great idea for them to have the ​option t​ o compost by having compost bins easily accessible to them. If the resolution were to be passed in the Senate, I would hope to collaborate with A.S. recycling and RHA to work out a way to implement the idea. My vision is to have compost bins accessible at every residence hall’s main lobby. There are a lot of factors to be considered, like who will be in charge of maintaining the bins? How often will someone go and collect them? How can we ensure that residents are aware that the bins are there? These are all things I hope to address when working with RHA and A.S. recycling.
One of my biggest mottos is: “think globally, act locally.” I think that by taking steps to make composting more widely available at UCSB, we are doing our part in helping reduce food waste, reducing GHG emissions, and combating the ongoing climate crisis.","I would work to involve the student body more and keep them informed about what the Senate is doing by maintaining public social media pages and posting important updates on those platforms as they happen. Moreover, I think it would be a great idea to author a directional bill that requires quarterly senate reports about what projects the Senate is working on and what bills and resolutions have been passed. If plausible and passed in the Senate, the bill would require updates from each senator and these reports would be sent out through a university announcement to students’ emails as a newsletter. I would hope to collaborate with the AS
Creative Media Unit, as well as other senators, to figure out how the layout of it would look. Perhaps only a small percentage of students may open the newsletter and take time to look through it, but I think this would help increase transparency and accountability of what the Senate does throughout the year. Also, it could encourage more students to get involved because by seeing what sorts of bills/resolutions have passed, they may think of something that they would like to be created and passed. I feel like this could be a good way of encouraging more involvement of the general student body and making A.S. more accessible to students.
","The top priority for the next UC President needs to be focusing on ensuring that the needs of ALL students are adequately met--this would include giving our graduate students across the UC system a COLA. Graduate students are the reason the UC system functions and they should not have the added pressures of having to spend more than half their paychecks on rent. Moreover, I believe the next UC President must prioritize lowering tuition costs in order to better address the needs of their students and to increase accessibility to higher education. Rising tuition prices have created more financial burdens for students. Approximately 40% of our fellow gauchos face food insecurity and high rent prices in Isla Vista place a large financial burden on many students. These financial burdens can make it difficult for students to focus on school and can create mental health issues which in turn can negatively impact students’ academic performance. Lowering tuition costs will make higher education more accessible for so many people, especially first-generation students, students of color, and students who are a part of the LGBTQ+ community, and alleviate financial burdens which will help them focus more on their academics and increase retention rate.",,,,,,,
Ryan Stofer,sofia,On Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_4571.jpg,,He / Him / His,1st,Mathematics,,,"I am running a senator with the 71st senate because I really do want to see change made across our campus. I have always been the type of person who is proactive and will take the first step in hopes of serving my community and helping others along the way. I have always enjoyed holding leadership positions throughout high school and when I came to UCSB, I wanted to expand my leadership skills even farther. Additionally, I wanted to find a role that helps communities or individuals that do not have a voice in issues and are not represented in certain organizations. As such, after learning more information about what an A.S. senator does and how they work to improve campus life, I have been excited and passionate to run to be one of the next senators for the 2020-2021 school year. In addition, I am running with the Isla Vista Party because my ideals coincide more with them. That being said, I am also excited to work with Campus United if I get the position in the upcoming term, since all of them are nice individuals and bipartisanship is important to creating tangible change for our campus. I am running to be a senator because I want to utilize my leadership skills to help the whole of campus and to represent marginalized voices in our community.","Throughout this past year, I was a member of the Residential Housing Association (RHA), which runs programs and holds events for ALL of our on campus residents. In addition, I have had the opportunity to speak with fellow Resident Directors, Assistant Resident Directors, and many Residential Assistants which helped me understand their different roles in serving the different needs of the residents. Furthermore, RHA holds weekly coordinating board meetings where we vote on flyering, support, and funding requests that pertain to any on-campus related event. As such, I have been informed of all the different funding organizations available across campus, where most are in fact AS entities. Too, not only was a member of RHA, I held a co-president position for my hall council. As co-president, I held weekly meetings for our hall council members and facilitated discussion about smaller funding requests that pertained to our building. Overall, my experience of being in RHA has not only given me connections to other on-campus organizations and experience in handling funding requests / voter representation, I have also immensely improved my leadership skills. I hope to use all of my knowledge from this past year and apply it to next year’s 71st senate.","If I was elected to serve on the Senate, one resolution I would plan to introduce is a resolution for the UC system to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. UCSB is the only UC school that has yet to pass such a resolution related to the current BDS movement occurring in today’s world. I believe that it is wrong that the UC system is able to act as a complicit third party to support corporations that profit off of Israel’s illegal occupation. Another bill I plan to introduce would be a bill to issue virtual office hours for all senators. Of course, this bill is quite tentative since we currently do not know if the current COVID-19 pandemic will make us continue our education through online learning for fall quarter of 2020. However, if that case does arise, I want to ensure that student concerns are still addressed through the creation of these virtual office hours, which can be held on Zoom or any other video conferencing platform. Finally, the last resolution I would author is a resolution against current discrimination against Asian groups during the past few months. It is a fact that many Asian communities have inadvertently been affected by the recent pandemic due to cases of verbal assault or other forms of discrimination. As such, I wish to author a resolution that condemns such discrimination as we as a community should be accepting of one another and in fact we have students from all across the world that attend UCSB who all wish to pursue their educational goals and should not be held back by any sort of racial discrimination.","My platform is mainly focused on five different topics, which I call, “D.R.E.A.M.”. The first is to distribute testing materials by adding machines in Far Side and some near Santa Catalina and to also include a program that distributes free testing materials for those in need. Next, I plan on working with Dining Services to make roll-over swipes an option for all students. In addition, this implementation will not raise the prices of our other current meal plan options. I also want to expand the services of CLAS through a creation of one-on-one service and increasing funding support so more students can get assistance through the program. Furthermore, I want to create more accessibility to mental health services since although CAPS is a great resource, the availability ranges throughout the year due to high demand. As such, I want to have office hours available for all on-campus residents. Finally, I would like to establish a one-on-one mentorship program that can be available for all on-campus students. Of course, the cost of this program also will not raise tuition or housing prices for any student. These are all of my main goals I have for my personal platform this next year.","As mentioned in the previous question, I have many organizations/entities that I want to reach out to in order to reach my goals for my platform. First off, I would like to contact UCSB University and Community Housing Services to see if and how I can allow the establishment of these vending machines for testing materials to be placed in the different residence halls. Next, I plan on reaching out to Dining Services to work out the logistics of implementing the option of roll-over swipes as a meal option for students. Also, I plan on working with CLAS to see what possible improvements can be made, whether if it is through financial support or through more sessions so that they can cater to more students. In addition, I want to work very closely with CAPS to see how they have tackled the high demand of requests for appointments and see what I can do to assist them. Finally, I want to reach out to the EOP, since they have already established the EOP Peer Mentorship program, and try to implement a similar one for any on-campus residents that are first-gen students. Even if not all goals are seen to fruition by the end of my term, I definitely want to tackle each issue and start change for the students on campus.","If the shift to online courses continues through summer and fall quarter, I will not hesitate to create virtual outlets to allow students to address their concerns pertaining to campus life. Of course, the easiest way to accomplish this goal would be to publicize my email to all so they have an immediate method to reach me. However, I also plan on hosting office hours through Zoom weekly so the discussion can be more one-on-one. In fact, if it truly does play a role in next year’s fall quarter, I plan on authoring a bill that mandates all senators to host virtual office hours as well. In addition, I will work with other on-campus senators to host a public forum that is available to all on-campus residents through a video conferencing app. This public forum would be to help address student concerns, particularly about campus involvement as we continue through online learning. Too, I will also share different resources or announcements from organizations through my social media accounts as I want to ensure people are informed of what is happening around campus. Either way, I want to enhance my online presence in order to help my constituents if they are in need of resources or want their voices to be heard in discussions.","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position as I am motivated to address student body concerns that are related to our campus. I hold student opinion on issues seriously and I am proactive in finding possible solutions, whether it be through outreach or compromise. I truly do want to see UCSB improve over time, and I am passionate about holding a senator role in order to accomplish these goals. In addition, I have had hands-on experience related to housing and have enhanced my leadership skills that are aligned with UCSB values. I do know what programs are available to assist student needs and I have connections with some organizations, such that I can work with them to improve the campus through my “D.R.E.A.M.” plan. Finally, I am willing to work with others in collaboration to achieve these goals. Of course, I am not only referencing the different organizations I am planning on reaching out to, but rather the future 71st senate as well. I love working with others and I am sure other senators in the 71st senate would be glad to help me out to achieve these goals and in return, I will also help them to attain their goals as well. In the end, we are all working together with the main goal of making the campus better, so it is best that we help each other during these challenging times.",Left-leaning,"Excellent; I believe that the 70th A.S. Senate has done great work in creating bills updating legal code while also passing resolutions that are in favor of the student body. In addition, the current A.S. Senate’s weekly meetings have been very beneficial for addressing student concerns during the public forum, especially about discussing the current COLA strikes. ",Yes; I am in full support of the BDS movement and I believe that it is wrong that the UC system is allowed to act as a “complicit third party” to support corporations that allow Israel’s occupation to violate the lives of others.,"Yes; I whole-heartedly believe that UCSB should be tuition-free for all students. Of course, this issue is not one that can be resolved at the school level, but can be advocated by students across campus to fight for a tuition-free campus.","Although there are mental health services available at UCSB, I believe that the current state of mental health services are inadequate and are in need of change as soon as possible. I think that the biggest issue surrounding mental health services is that there are not enough personnel/therapists to assist students as it is in high demand. Furthermore, the stigma surrounding mental health in itself is an issue that must be addressed. As such, the best solution to this issue would be to allow more funding to CAPS so that they are able to assist more students on campus. In addition, other student organizations, both in and out of campus, should host events regarding mental health such that the stigma of mental health is resolved. Of course, the fight for mental health is one that takes time and although the mental health services at UCSB may not be able to fully an individual, there are definitely strides that can be made to make them more efficient and helpful to all.","I whole-heartedly believe that UCSB could have definitely handled the reports of sexual assault better during this past year. Although announcements and e-mails were sent out to students weeks after the original incidents occurred, the response time was delayed and required more immediate action as students felt that their thoughts were not being heard by campus administration. I believe that better communication could have been established after the first reports were made. Although I understand the university can not act on reports without substantial evidence, a simple acknowledgement of the issue at hand could ease tensions between the university and student body. Thus, it is essential that UCSB can learn from this past incident to make sure that, if events similar to this one in the near future arise, the university can create a faster response to ease worrying students. It would be unacceptable if their actions have not improved since the fall quarter of 2019.","I believe that Title IX is an “okay” system to address sexual assault on UC campuses, but still requires improvement. For UCSB at least, the Title IX Office ensures that each case is reviewed when given sufficient evidence and makes potential charges accordingly. That being said, I think that the enforcement of Title IX is one that can be refined for the UC campuses. Although the Title IX Office does work closely with the Office of Student Conduct and the Dean of Students Office when dealing with sexual assault cases, the process of going through such cases take a large amount of time and can be frustrating when the survivor’s story is not being identified as the truth. As such, even though the ideals of Title IX is one I fully support, the actual enforcement of Title IX can be changed to better support the survivor and as well as can be more effective with being more communicative when sexual assault reports are made on UC campuses.","I believe that UCSB is making valiant efforts to serve underrepresented groups, but can also further themselves to assist marginalized communities in the future as well. That being said, I am personally glad that there are services available for communities that can be found at the Multicultural Center and the Student Resources Building. However, although organizations are set up for these diverse communities across campus, advancements can still be made in creating safe spaces for these individuals. One of the biggest priorities UCSB should be focusing on is to ensure that these communities have a way to communicate their concerns or opinions on campus matters. What I mean by this is that the university should consistently make sure that minority voices are able to be heard in all conversations related to campus life. Having minority opinions in these types of conversations can aid these groups to be able to have a more equitable student life while being a student at UCSB.","If I was elected to serve on the Senate, the first resolution I would plan to author is a resolution for the UC system to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. To be frank, it is still surprising to me that UCSB is the only UC campus left that has yet to create any stance on this issue related to the BDS movement. As I said earlier, I believe that it is morally wrong that the UC system is able to act as a complicit third party to support corporations that profit off of Israel’s illegal occupation. Furthermore, the resolution would also indirectly support the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties. In addition, seeing that this exact resolution has been passed in all other UC campuses, it should be very tangible to pass in our own Senate by next year’s term.","I think that A.S. has the ability of connecting themselves to the whole student body simply by hosting events that are tailored to the public. Of course, there are already public forums available to all every week during each A.S. Senate meeting, but there could be more events created for the general student body. For example, having public forums or Q&A sessions open to students every month/quarter allows the student body to ask questions they have about what the Senate is up to with current bills or resolutions. Furthermore, having info sessions about A.S. for all on-campus residents can be highly beneficial in having students become more proactive in their community and could also influence them to be a part of A.S. in the future as well. Overall, I think the best solution to this underlying issue is to just present awareness of A.S. and explain the functionality and how A.S. is able to help the general student body.","One of the qualities that I would see as a top priority for choosing the next UC President is being able to listen and address both under-graduate and graduate student concerns. Time and time again, issues blow out of proportion as lead administration refuses to address student concerns whether it be a delayed response or simply none given. As such, a UC President who truly listens to student concerns can be highly beneficial in resolving conflict before any arises. Furthermore, the next UC President should be one who also focuses on the needs of students from low-income households. As tuition prices continue to rise, students from low-income households are forced to rely solely on FAFSA, Cal grants, scholarships, and any other financial aid support available. That being said, the next UC President should ensure that students relying on financial aid should be guaranteed that they will be able to finish their education without having to worry about financial aid being stripped away from them.",,,,,,,
Katrina Sacluti,sofia,On Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katrina-Sacluti.jpeg,,she/her/hers,1st,Political Science,,,"I am running to be an on-campus senator with the 71st senate because I want the senate to be made of students with bright ideas, enthusiasm, and overall want the best for UCSB and I firmly believe that I can contribute as a representative of these ideals. Part of our tuition goes towards Associated Students and my work will guarantee that those funds are going towards beneficial resources to help all students. I’m a student too, I don’t want the money that I spend to go to waste, to be used in vain. It’s not cheap to attend here! Students should not only be proud of the work that Associated Students does, but everyone should reap the benefits of them as well. There’s so many ideas that I have that I know can happen and aid all demographics on campus now and in the future from providing free access to feminine hygiene products for all students in bathrooms and determined areas in equal or greater quantity than the supply of free condoms to changing the swipe system to allow students to use their meals on other students, friends, or family as they wish to do without interference with rollover swipes. By being a senator, I don’t just have to advocate for my ideas, I can take action to make them be a reality.","I was a Pearman Fellow for the EVPSA office and worked specifically under the Legislative Director, becoming involved with issues within our campus and beyond, up to a state level. This is reassurance that I am not a stranger to the works behind A.S. and have experience aiding work already within Associated Students. I am also greatly involved in Kapatirang Pilipino, specifically KP’s political committee and Pilipino Cultural Night. Within KP’s political committee, we hold events to educate members of issues or movements related to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. I know what it takes to start from the beginning of a project, or in this case an event, and how to work on its logistical aspects until it’s built up. Though PCN had to be cancelled because of COVID-19, I still had the opportunity to experience being involved as a cast member and costumes committee member. Again, this underscores my ability to work on multiple things and collaborate. Moreover, I am in the Legal Education Association for Diversity (LEAD) because not only do I want to act on the behalf of my student population’s best interest, but I aspire to be a human rights lawyer and defend the defenseless after my undergraduate education. This seamlessly translates to the reason why I’m running in the first place: I want to be a senator to serve those like me who deserve to be served by the institution. Lastly, though this was not on campus or in Isla Vista, I find it important to highlight my experience the summer before I started attending UCSB in APAPA (Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs) -- an organization aimed to empower Asian and Pacific Islander Americans through education, leadership and active participation in civic and public affairs. Through it, I interned in my local Deputy District Attorney’s office because of it and gained a lot of experience in what it takes to work in an environment similar to the senate.","I feel very passionate about all the plans included on my platform and would love to introduce all of them as resolutions or bills while in office. One of them is providing free access to feminine hygiene products for all students in bathrooms and determined areas in equal or greater quantity than the supply of free condoms. I am all for supporting protection and safe sex, but as a woman, I can tell you that our periods are not as optional. I say this not to demean the supply of condoms, but to emphasize that pads and tampons should be as readily available, if not more available. A period can happen at any time while on campus and these items in bathrooms would be very supportive and reassuring for women. Second, I’d love to change the swipe system to allow students to use their meals on other students, friends, or family as they wish to do without interference with rollover swipes. We are the ones paying for these swipes and we have every right to use them as we please. To have additional swipes that could be used by guests yet be forced to pay $12 for each individual due to policy is greedy of the institution and not morally wrong. Lastly, I’d like to build our pre-law and pre-med advising to be stronger with exam practices, workshops, and personalized plans. Since we do not have a pre-nursing or pre-law major, I want to compensate through the strength of our professional advising.","My platform is for the students. I would know as a student. My platform is not plans for you, it’s plans for us. I’m a student and I want everything on my platform to go through. All my ideas are meant to support students and I believe that will consequently gain the support of students. Because the rest of the senate is made up of students, I know that a lot of them share my ideas or are supportive of them and as a result, for every idea will be a team behind me. At the end of the day, I’ll never be working for just myself or ever alone because I’ll have the support of Associated Students and the student body behind me who are all advocating for this. I also know student organizations that work towards certain items on my platform, such as free feminine hygiene products, and we could work together to make such ideas happen. I’ll make sure to give my attention to every item and will focus with one item at a time if deemed necessary, but again, because of the great support, I know that collaboration and support will have my items get established sooner than later.","There is a variety of specific organizations or entities I can work with in order to achieve my platform and I touched upon this in the previous question. For example, for free feminine hygiene products, I know there is a PERIOD Chapter at UCSB. It’s an organization whose goal is to provide free menstrual hygiene products in public bathrooms around campus and to increase awareness about period poverty and stigma. This is very similar to what I have in mind! We could definitely work together to make this happen and go into further detail, such as advocating for these feminine products to be sustainable and eco-friendly. We could even go further and promote the use of sustainable products like the menstrual cup. Throughout my platform, there is always an organization or group in discussion. I cannot change the swipe system without some extent of communication with UCSB Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary Enterprises in the same way I cannot build the pre-law and pre-med advising without talking to the pre-professional advising department. For all of these ideas that have the factor of money, I would talk to the financial committee to work out a budget without the need to raise tuition. All in all, I plan to maintain correspondence with a range of entities to achieve what is best for our school.","To make myself available to my fellow students during my term if the shift to online courses continues through summer and fall quarter, I will have a public Facebook page specifically for this position, meaning an account separate from my personal one. On this page, I will publish my office hours. My office hours will be held over zoom. However, I would like to make it clear that my office hours are not the only times I can be reached. For example, my email will be available at all times. I check my email quite frequently, so you shouldn’t expect a long delay in response. If those two prior methods seem impersonal to you, I will also remain public in all my social media platforms to be accessible. I am okay with this flexible form of correspondence, a simple conversation in direct messages, but again I will be readily available in the two other ways as well and I’ll make that known. The link to my zoom for holding office hours will be available on all my accounts -- my professional Facebook and my personal social media platforms, as well as my email. Any way you know how to reach me and I’ll be there. I hold myself accountable to be active in all the ways that I just listed and you should not expect any less.","I am the best candidate for this position because I have the experience and capabilities to be professional and efficient in this specific work environment, the beneficial and meaningful ideas within my platform, and the passion and motivation to push each individual item on my platform through. All of these factors are important. I am credible and trustworthy. Though I am a first year and had my last on-campus quarter moved to remote learning, I am still able to identify areas of needed attention and help at our school. I believe that the items on my platform are things that you want, that we want. If you do not want the things on my platform to come to life, then you don’t have to vote for me. But I am confident that we all want to see a better UCSB -- a UCSB that feeds other students, friends, and family with the swipes we paid for and choose to use on them; a UCSB that looks out for those with periods and provides free menstrual products for them; a UCSB that wants the best for their students looking into professional professions and resources related to this pathway; a UCSB that expands CLAS and the accessibility of class resources with all students in mind; a UCSB that has nothing to hide when it comes to the transparency of Associated Students. You can contribute to making UCSB better for you, I, our fellow gauchos, and the students to come, as long as you believe in me and my ideas and vote.",Left-leaning,"Very good; I think the 70th A.S. Senate definitely had the student body in mind through their work and accomplishments (e.g. a resolution on rollover meal swipes), but there is always room for improvement and in this case, there is still plenty of work needed to be done to address all student needs.","Yes; I vote in favor of a resolution to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. By being the only ASUC that has not formally passed a resolution, we are consequently supporting these companies that profit from human rights violations in Israel.","No; UCSB should not be tuition free YET until being tuition free is universally adopted across the nation. I say this because as a public school, we are supported financially by the government and realistically UCSB cannot succeed as a tuition free university on its own without federal jurisdiction. All public universities need to be free through federal mandates.","The mental health services at UCSB are good, but surely there is more the university could do and provide. For example, with CAPS, your first three sessions are free and subsequent sessions are $15 co-pay -- only if you have UC SHIP or private health insurance. Things get difficult if you have the latter and it does not cover future sessions. CAPS is not as accessible as it is advertised to be, only truly available if one has enough funds. This unjustly puts those of less financial stability or without insurance at a disadvantage than those with money and with insurance, putting down an entire group of students. Additionally, after your first three, you are typically recommended to a community clinician. CAPS is made for short term therapy and that is not convenient for most students. I would like to work towards abolishing the co-pay if you have UC SHIP, considering UCSB’s value of mental health should translate to encompassing covering therapy with their health insurance. Moreover, it is an important investment to gradually have therapists available for long term counseling, especially when several students expect CAPS to always be there for them. Another change I would like to make within the scope of mental health services is to have a safe space for victims of sexual harassment and assault.","During Fall Quarter 2019, there were indeed multiple reports of sexual assault occurring on fraternity property and the critiques towards the university for its slow response to the reports and failure to address student concerns are absolutely just. The university could have handled the situation better in multiple ways. Date rape drugs were used at least twice at a UCSB fraternity event and they protected the fraternity’s image over the safety of the student body by purposefully leaving out which fraternity it was. This was a poor response from the school, especially considering the first reporting was on October 17th and a second one happened on October 27th. I was embarrassed by my choice of school within my first quarter, for being enrolled in the same institution as these predators and for my school of choice’s delay in proper action. This could have been prevented if Sigma Pi was called out since the beginning in order to alert students to be cautious or to stay away entirely. Instead of the fraternity being named and held accountable, us students were sent “safety tips” and later were offered self defense courses. While these initially seem helpful, it came across as victim blaming when there should be something done to the threat to the UCSB community. Sigma Pi got away with only a five day suspension. There needs to be more severe repercussions and stern background checking for Greek life, especially when matters have to do with sexual assault.","Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the university's programs and activities. Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, and retaliation are forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX. By word of mouth, this sounds like an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. It has the right values and ideas in mind; it has good intentions. Title IX requires schools to have an established procedure for handle complaints of sexual harassment. It grants schools the capability to issue no-contract directives to prevent accused students from approaching or interacting with you. Likewise, Title IX prohibits schools from certain actions like retaliating against someone for filing a report; schools are mandated to keep students and their reports safe from other or more harassment. The most important aspect to acknowledge is if these ideals are being acted upon -- unfortunately I would have to answer no, that UCs fall short still and UCSB is an example. How UCSB handled the sexual assaults within Sigma Pi demonstrates that these institutions may have an established procedure when it comes to sexual harassment, but it’s either insufficient or they do not follow through.","UCSB effectively serves historically underrepresented groups, but only through the work in Associated Students and student organizations. The institution itself holds back members of the black, latinx, LGBTQ+ community, and others and it is only the students themselves that serve historically underrepresented groups. I’ve experienced this firsthand through Pilipino Cultural Night (PCN). I was heavily involved in PCN as a cast member and costumes committee member. PCN is a show to display Filipino culture for students, staff, faculty, and our surrounding communities. It’s entirely student-run and a way to showcase of Filipino culture. According to the main coordinators, PCN has recently experienced problems, conflicting with UCSB over the use of empty spaces after school hours for PCN related events and practices. As a student representative, I feel passionate about supporting these clubs and standing up for them when faced with an adversary. These student organizations build communities that are safe havens for many students of shared backgrounds, cultures, interests, and so forth. For ethnic clubs, the lack of support from UCSB to permit use of empty spaces exemplifies an area I would combat alongside them. Perhaps, for UCSB to become more committed to serving minorities and discriminated groups, this is the first area they should look at. Afterwards, faculty could become more involved and provide support. UCSB needs to prioritize making and giving spaces to underrepresented communities. Though the showcase has been a success for years without faculty directly involved, their support does not have to be limited to attending the event. How they decide to contribute is uniquely up to them.","The first resolution that I would aim to author is for meal swipes. Changing the swipe system to allow students to use their meals on other students, friends, or family is very important to me because we are the ones paying for our swipes and it is our right to use them as we please. It is greedy for the institution to forbid it and knowing this year’s AS Senate passed a resolution in support of rollover meal swipes, I can see my goal being attainable as well. I would want these two resolutions to work together, not clash, by having meal swipes roll over without a cap until the end of the school year. Any of these swipes would be available for the student to use for themselves or for their guest(s). A close second would be for the expansion of free feminine hygiene products in bathrooms or other designated areas. I noticed there are some in the women’s center, SRB bathroom, and the A.S. food bank. There could be so much more improvement beyond that! I aspire to play a part in establishing the free access to feminine hygiene products for all students in bathrooms and determined areas in equal or greater quantity than the supply of free condoms which are notably present in several bathrooms on campus. If condoms can be provided in large amounts with no cost, so can pads and tampons.","Students feel A.S. is typically inaccessible to them and that is something I noted in my platform. Part of our student fees is for Associated Students and I find it so important for the student body to know exactly where their money is going towards and having that money ultimately go back to them through a range of resources. I want to increase the transparency of work of Associated Students starting with budget visibility, seeing exactly how much money is received and where it’s disbursed. Similarly, it shouldn’t be difficult for students to find what work has been done. Instead of requiring students to search on their own -- if they ever find the motivation to -- students should be receiving a monthly email that provides updates on the Senate from proposed resolutions, amendments, etc. Minutes can be attached if they wish to read about a meeting more thoroughly. These emails would also act as a reminder that students are capable and welcome to speak during a Senate meeting, keeping them informed and potentially attracting their involvement. Moreover, in general towards students seeing A.S. as inaccessible, I feel as though the Pearman Fellowship Program and positions within offices are not promoted well enough. Both are great opportunities to work directly in Associated Students and I would happily be part of the team to build their advertisement. If they choose to grow in involvement, A.S. would no longer feel so distant from them because they would realize they could directly be a part of it.","UC President Janet Napolitano is stepping down from her position in August and her replacement should recognize what I and many others consider to be the top priorities for the next UC President: tuition affordability, carbon neutrality, food insecurity, and reforming the UC’s approach towards preventing and responding to sexual harassment and assault. UC President Napolitano wanted to enroll historic numbers of California undergraduates and while this is appreciated, I would like the housing crisis of several UCs to be readjusted, the hunger of college students to be reduced, and the overall experience of every UC student to be enhanced. I hope a balance can be worked in which UCs can be more affordable through lowering costs or providing substantial financial aid all while maintaining quality and growth of its student resources and facilities. Moreover, considering how large the university system is and what an impact it could make, I hope that being economically conscious becomes a priority in our ten campuses, five medical centers, three affiliated national laboratories, and the statewide agriculture and natural resources program. Lastly, the UCs do have a history of students mixed in with sexual misconduct and disappointing responses to such events -- reformation is necessary here.",,,,,,,
Alexandra Perez,sofia,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alexandra-Perez.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,2nd,Political Science and History of Public Policy and Law double major,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 71st senate because I want to be a better resource to those around me and help implement new ideas to better support students. I have heard the complaints of my fellow friends and peers about how they feel that the university is not doing enough to support our students, and I agree. I am running to be a senator because I have big ideas and the ambition and drive to do it. When I arrived at UCSB, I was excited but also nervous because it was a whole new world. It was challenging adjusting to the quarter system and also being away from home. A lot of students seek help from the university and while the university does provide a lot of resources, I noticed how the resources fell short when it came to helping all of the student body. I am running for senator because I want to help meet the needs of students and provide more resources so everyone who attends UCSB can succeed and feels like they belong on this campus. I am running because I want to advocate on behalf of students and create real change for this university.","I have been involved in several ways on campus. One way is by being a member of RHA and hall council. Through this, I was able to create programs and events for the Santa Catalina community and allowed me to practice my communication and leadership skills. Another way was by serving as the Outreach and Recruitment Chair for A.S. Committee on Committees. This has prepared me by developing my professional skills and collaborating with other A.S. entities to focus on outreach for people to join A.S. and help make the system meet student needs. I have also been involved on campus by being an RA. Being an RA has taught me many skills such as time management, leadership skills, community development, and much more. It has helped me become a more all-around person and has allowed me to become a better resource to not only residents but to every one of my peers. I have also been involved in the political climate on campus in ways such as protesting in solidarity with the COLA strike. These involvements have prepared me to be a senator because they have allowed me to learn the needs of my fellow peers and the ways in which our university can better support our student body.","One bill I would like to introduce while I am in office is a bill to provide free menstrual products in places on campus such as resident hall bathrooms, lecture hall bathrooms, and non-binary bathrooms, and in places around Isla Vista. I know the 69th senate passed a bill to create a committee to explore how we can provide menstrual products and I want to build on the bill by collaborating with other organizations and entities to put it into action. This is important because menstrual products can be expensive and can be a resource for students that need menstrual products. This bill would put menstrual products in lecture hall bathrooms and in gender-neutral bathrooms around campus to guarantee that any student who needs a product will be able to attain one. Another bill I would introduce is a bill to establish a quarterly A.S. senate town hall to promote transparency between elected senators and their constituents in order to hold senators accountable and collect feedback and concerns from their peers. This would help make A.S. seem more accessible and as a resource for students to use when they want their voices to be heard. A resolution I would like to introduce is a resolution to condemn the human rights violations in the form of femicides happening in Mexico. Hate crimes against women in Mexico continue to occur each day and our UCSB A.S. Senate has a commitment to fight against human rights violations.","My platform is geared to help not only my constituency of Off-Campus residents but all students at this university. I have six main ideas on my platform that focus on improving resources for students. My first is to extend the walk in-hours/availability of CAPS. I believe this is important because the health and wellbeing of students should be a top priority for the university and I believe we can do more to help students in a timely manner. I also want to collaborate with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and the EVPLA to work on how we can extend busses and provide more frequent busses to Isla Vista because a lot of students can not afford bikes and the bus is their main form of transportation. Many students rely on the 27 bus to take them to campus and because they run so infrequently and are smaller busses, a lot of students are not even able to get on a bus or have to wait long amounts of time to catch a bus. Another item on my platform is providing free menstrual products in lecture hall bathrooms and in places around Isla Vista such as the Pardall center, IV and Embarcadero Hall, and the Isla Vista Community Center. The next thing on my platform is combating food insecurity by providing more meal vouchers to residents of Isla Vista and working with Housing, Dining, and Auxiliary enterprises to work on allowing students to bring take-home storage containers to help combat food insecurity and food waste. I also want to implement a Mental Health, Sexual and Gender Diversity, and Cultural Diversity, training for incoming first-years and university employees in order to help promote a more inclusive environment for all students. Finally, I want to establish a quarterly AS-wide Town Hall as a forum for open discussion with the student body. Mandatory attendance of all senators and executives would be required in order to hold the accountability of elected officials. I would also like to extend the invitation to boards, committees, and units (BCU) chairs to encourage them to share what they are working on and what we are doing to collaborate together. I know A.S. has a connotation as being inaccessible to the student body so I want to encourage transparency and space for feedback from students in order to better serve them.","I hope to work with multiple organizations and entities to help achieve my platform. I believe we have strong organizations that already do a lot for students and should be recognized and collaborated with in order to provide more beneficial services to all students. I hope to work with the Period Chapter at UCSB, The Women’s Center (WGSE), Commission on Student Well-being(COSWB), and the Residential Hall Association (RHA) to collaborate on ways to get menstrual products in campus lecture hall bathrooms and in non-binary bathrooms around both campus and in Isla Vista. I also hope to work with the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) to help combat food waste in dining commons by working with Housing, Dining, and Auxillary enterprises to allow students to bring their own food storage containers to help combat food waste and food insecurity. I also hope to work with CAPS, Student Commission on Racial Equality (SCORE), Queer Commission, the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), and the Resource Center Sexual & Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to help create a curriculum for first-year students and UC employees to better support the student diversity reflected on this campus and to inform and provide a sense of inclusion for all incoming students current students.","If the shift to online courses continues through summer and fall quarter, I would host Zoom office hours each week to make myself available to my constituents. My constituents would also have my email to contact me at any time. I strongly believe that during this time, we as a student body should support each other and be a resource to one another in the best way that we can, whenever we can. I would also encourage my fellow senators to collaborate on a group Zoom call once a month that would be open for the student body to join. They would be able to voice their concerns and ideas to us. We would also relay information to our constituents on what we will be working on to continue to support and provide resources for students. I would love to introduce myself in Zoom lectures as a way to reach out to different students. Some constituents that would be difficult to reach are the students who do not have equal access to technology or internet access and I want to advocate on their behalf as well and be able to address their concerns. I strongly believe the university must do something to help students who do not have equal access to the internet or to technology that would give them resources to allow them to be successful at this university.","I believe I am the best candidate because I am ambitious, hardworking, and am well qualified for the position. When I was younger, my dad told me a quote that continues to motivate me today; “you’re not smart, you’re hardworking.” I work hard and do everything to the best of my ability. I am committed to the student body because I am committed to making a difference and helping all students succeed and attain the resources they deserve. As a daughter of immigrants and as a Latinx woman of color, I have been disadvantaged many times in my life, but I chose to overcome those struggles and work hard to be where I am today. My parents worked hard to allow me to be where I am today and I want to be the change I wish to see in the world, and it starts here at this university. I care very much about our campus community and believe that caring about the UCSB community is very important when it comes to leadership roles. This is reflected in my job as an RA and knowing important resources and ways to better serve our community. I have had multiple leadership experiences and am excited about helping students. In my daily life, I practice activism by advocating for students and working hard to do my best for others. I am a devout public servant and this is what I enjoy doing. I know I can help make this university a more inclusive and resourceful place for all.",Left-leaning,"Good; I think the 70th A.S. Senate did a good job in addressing the needs of the student body because they passed several resolutions such as one to reissue UCSB as a sanctuary campus and also a resolution to defeat the stigma on mental health and better support undergraduates. However, I do think a lot more student-issued bills could have been passed such as actual solutions to problems like a way to help with the stigma on mental health. As a senator, I will follow my campus-based resolutions up with bills that promote action surrounding the issue.","Yes; I would vote in favor to divest in alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement because I strongly believe that any company that profits from the violation of human rights should be condoned. The violations that Israel has perpetuated and allowed against Palestinians are not acceptable and A.S. should join other undergraduate ASUC’s to align with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. The UC system should rescind it’s funding and place it towards initiatives that address student needs like Basic Needs. ","Yes; I believe that UCSB should be tuition-free because everyone should have the opportunity to get a higher education regardless of their socioeconomic standing. The fact of the matter is, that in these times, a college degree is very valuable for the workforce. No one should be prevented from an education and the high cost of tuition is hard on certain people. UCSB should be helping its students succeed and free tuition would be the first step to better helping us students. The UC was always meant to be tuition-free and must return to that model. ","I do not believe that mental health services at UCSB are adequate. As a student that has sought help from CAPS, I can personally say that I had a bad experience. You can walk in for a brief assessment at CAPS which is good, however, you can only come in during a small window, and if you are not one of the first ones there, they won’t have any more space available. I had to go to CAPS three times before I could finally be briefly assessed. They also do not have enough therapists staffed. I know multiple students who have had to wait weeks, and even months to be seen. This is not acceptable because mental health is very important and if someone needs to be seen ASAP, it is important to see them. Furthermore, the clinical staff is lacking in people of color. I was unable to get a therapist I felt comfortable with because I hoped to have someone who was Chicanx to better understand me and my culture, but that did not end up happening. I also know they only have one psychologist for international students, one of our biggest UCSB populations. It is not acceptable that the diversity of the CAPS clinical staff does not reflect the diversity of the student body it is supposed to serve. There is already a stigma around mental health, and part of breaking that stigma is seeing people like you, that have problems like you, and especially people like you to help you. CAPS needs to hire a more diverse clinical staff and make more availability to students. That is why on my platform I have the plan to help increase the walk-in hours for CAPS in order to fit more students. It is unacceptable that so many students have to wait a long time and feel turned away because our university is not providing enough resources.","I definitely believe that the university could have handled the situation better. It took a long time for the university to address this issue and while things were still being addressed, the fraternity in question was still allowed to continue to participate in Greek life events. While I do not believe the entire fraternity should be penalized for certain member’s actions, I do believe the fraternities should have been held responsible and should have held the member/s accused accountable as soon as possible. The university sent us out an email on October 28th stating that the day before the incident occurred and not much was done until the next following weeks. The IFC (Interfraternity Council) determined the consequence for themselves, the fraternities, to place a moratorium on all social events. There was no direct action from the university and the students were left out of the loop and confused and worried about the situation. The failure to communicate clearly from the university left many students frustrated. The only thing that I know of that is being done is a “Task Force for Safer Social Events” which is trying to bring change, however, the moratorium was lifted and socials occurred once again.","I do not believe Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Title IX is complicated and confusing and with the soon to be added rules from Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, it puts the survivor in an uncomfortable position should they choose to go through with the claim by placing them in cross-examination with the perpetrator. As an RA, I was trained in Title IX briefly, and I can say it is in fact confusing. The system is flawed and can often be very discouraging to survivors because it can be confusing and long. The new added laws will also redefine harassment and make it more narrow scoped, which also turns away survivors. This system is not adequate in addressing sexual assault on UC campuses and needs to be more survivor-oriented. It disadvantages survivors who have a lack of resources whether it is financially or emotionally.","I do not believe UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups. Over the years, UCSB has made steps towards becoming more inclusive towards these communities, however, I believe the university can do better. One thing that I instantly noticed at UCSB was the lack of diversity in the faculty. I know that, for example, the department I am in does not have many professors of color. The diversity of the professors and instructors who are teaching us does not reflect the diversity of the student population. This includes sexual and gender diversity. For example, UCSB has an out list for faculty members who identify with the LGBTQ+ community and there are very few faculty who are on the list, once again not reflecting the student body. I believe that diversifying faculty is essential in order to better serve these underrepresented communities because then they would get some representation. This is just one way the university could dedicate itself to truly serving its entire student population.","If elected to serve on the Senate, the first resolution I would pass is a resolution to work with CAPS and Student Health to extend their walk-in hours/availability for students. I have heard the frustrations of many of my peers and have felt them firsthand. It is hard for a student to be seen at Student Health because it takes a while to make an appointment. Also for walk-ins, you have to often wait a while to be seen. For CAPS, it is unfair that the walk-in hours are so narrow and that if you can not go right when the walk-in hours start you can not be seen. This is important because the health and the well-being of students is important and should be a priority for the institution. It is hard enough for some people to seek help and then when they go seek it, there is no availability. I will work with fellow senators to make sure we do something to address this problem because it is not acceptable.","My job as a senator would be to not only advocate on behalf of the student body but to also be transparent with them and listen to what my constituents have to say. In my platform, I talked about how I wanted to have a quarterly AS-wide Town Hall as a forum for open discussion with the student body. This would require the mandatory attendance of all senators and executives in order to hold the accountability of elected officials. During this town hall, we would allow for students to voice their concerns or ask any questions regarding what we as senators would be doing together for students. We would advertise this town hall to inform students about this. I also think it would be a good idea to create social media platforms such as an A.S. Senate Twitter or Instagram in order to tweet bills passed and allow for UCSB community members to DM us for concerns in order to come off as less intimidating and to show that we really value the opinions of our constituents.","The priorities of the next UC President should be dedicated to the benefits of the students and not the institution. We saw how Janet handled the protest of UCSC’s TA’s who were striking for COLA(cost of living adjustment). She condoned the firing of the TA’s and made no progressive strides towards granting COLA or even engaging in a negotiation. With the COVID-19 crisis occurring currently, our striking here at UCSB got cut short as we were told that campus was closed and classes were moved to remote instruction. The new UC President should work to give COLA to the graduate teaching assistants who work hard to help the professors and us, the undergraduates, while also being students themselves. Another top priority for the next UC President is to stop the construction of the telescope on the mountain Mauna Kea as it is disrupting and violating the sacred culture of the people on the island. Finally, the next UC President must work towards making UCs more accessible to any student that wants to study at a UC. They can do this by making the UCs tuition-free or at least lessening the cost. The University of California system prides itself on being the center for research and education, but would not be able to achieve all that it has without its students and workers. The UC system receives much of its funding from donors and should be able to at least lessen the cost while maintaining the services and jobs that it provides. The UC President is supposed to serve the students and the next UC President should be devoted to the students.",,,,,,,

As a low income queer latinx first generation working student, I believe a lot of my needs have been dissmissed due to underrepresntation of my identities on the senate. For me, becoming senator next year means that I will be able to represent and showcase support to the many underrepresented communities off campus and on campus. Many of these communities and identities have not been given the necessary resources and safe spaces that are needed to succeed in a top tier university like UCSB.
I am running to be a senator because I am done waiting on a response on the issues that I face day to day. I am done waiting on the school to solve the constant events of sexual assault and hate crimes occuring off campus. I am done waiting for the voices of my constituents to be heard. Because I am tired of waiting, I have decided to run to be senator so that my peers and I no longer have to wait. Becoming senator, I would have the ability to not only speak and be heard, but to take action on these issues. I am running to be next year's senator because I want to make a difference in the college experience for the current and future UCSB students.","Within my two years of being at UCSB, I have achieved to become Marketing/External
Chair for the Queer and Trans Latinx Organization, La Familia de Colores and a member of Theta Nu Kappa Multicultural and Academic Fraternity Inc. These are two organizations who are very distinct from one another, yet I have gained the same knowledge of becoming a leader from both. They have taught me not only to be a leader who leads, but one who knows how to communicate, listen, and work with others.
La Familia de Colores is an organization that creates an open and safe space for latinx queer and trans identities on campus. Although this organization had been part of UCSB for almost a decade, the organization stopped functioning for almost two years. This year, I, along with the rest of the board and none board members, have worked on reopening this organization
that served as a home for many. Throughout this year, we have worked on creating weekly meetings, events, and workshops that help create the needed safe space for our shared identities.
As marketing/external of the organization, I have also worked on bringing as many individuals who identify with these identities into our safe space. I truly work on reaching out to queer and trans latinx identities looking for a Familia where they can be accepted, loved, and protected. In less than a year, La Familia de Colores went from having fifteen to thirty members coming to our weekly meetings. Additionally, not only do we interact in person, but we connect with over one hundred individuals throughout our social media platforms. With less than two quarters in the works, La Familia has become a small club to an official registered OSL organization.
With the hard work and dedication I have given to these organizations and the knowledge and experience I have gained from them, I am prepared for the challenges it takes to be a senator. I am ready to face the many difficulties that come from being a senator. I might not have the answer to every issue right away, but I have the ability to take the necessary measures to find one.

","A main issue that is constantly addressed by UCSB students is the financial burden of being a college student. While in office, I will introduce a resolution that allows for immediate and uncomplicated emergency grants for students facing financial difficulties. Although my number one objective is for an adjustment in the living and tuition cost of the university, yet, this is an issue that takes time to tackle. Thus, my immediate solution is to provide these efficient emergency grants that do not require an excessive amount of proof and can be given to a greater number of students.
Secondly, I will introduce a resolution or bill that holds perpetrators of sexual assault and hate crimes accountable for their actions. In the past, specifically this year, the school has taken a passive approach towards these constant horrific events. We have allowed for these attacks to become easily done because there is no serious punishment given to the perpetrators and their actions. As senator my priority is the safety of students and to stand with survivors. This new bill or resolution will make a change in the community we live in, it will no longer take a passive approach to these attacks.
Lastly, I will introduce a resolution that allows for students to obtain five meal vouchers per week. As of right now, off-campus students are only granted three meal vouchers a quarter, which becomes very limited for the eleven weeks of the quarter. Day to day many UCSB students face food insecurity, yet at the end of the day the dining commons are throwing entire bins of food away. This resolution will help reduce food insecurities within students.","My objective is to adjust the living situation and cost students face while living in Isla Vista. I want to be able to tackle the price of housing in Isla Vista because we pay too much for the poor housing conditions we are exposed to. In order to efficiently make a change in making affordable housing in Isla Vista I will work alongside Isla Vista Tenants Union, External Vice President for Local Affairs, and Santa Barbara County. Working along with these entities will allow me to have further information on how to tackle the high cost of living in Isla Vista. Adjusting the living situation of students is also about providing resources for them. Running as an off-campus senator, I am looking forward to creating a change within the living situation we are pushed to be in. My goal is to work with other organizations and entities in order to bring this change for my fellow UCSB students. As I mentioned before I would like to introduce a resolution that reduces food insecurities for off campus students. This resolution would provide students with five meal vouchers a week with no additional cost on their BARC account.","As mentioned previously, my goal is to specifically work and collaborate with Isla VistaTenant Union, the External Vice President for Local Affairs, and with county supervisor, Joan Hartman. In order to make this change in our housing situation, these are three great entities that will allow me to find the solution for this issue.The Isla Vista Tenants Union is an organization that has been constantly advocating and fighting for tenant rights. By working alongside them it will allow me to achieve my platform as I believe these adjustments are a mutual goal for both of us. Working with me will be beneficial as they would be able to provide me with the resources and knowledge needed to make these adjustments possible.
","COVID-19 has and continues to significantly affect the living situation of many. In hopes
for this to end, I believe I need to be prepared to take the necessary measures if this situation continues on to summer and fall quarter. If summer and fall quarter become online, I would be available to my constituents through social media, email, and by creating two to three weekly zoom office hours or by appointment.
For me, I am a person who prefers one-on-one physical conversations, however these drastic measures drive us out of our comfort zone in order to do what has to be done. I understand that online availability is not as efficient, however I will be as flexible as possible in order to accomodate my constituents with any help needed. As senator, I will do the required work to make myself the most available to my constituents.","By being part of different organizations and getting to know several individuals throughout my two years here, I have obtained the necessary information that grants me the opportunity to know what my constituents need for a better college experience. I am aware of the resources and protection that Queer and Trans individuals need. I am aware of the struggles that WOC, POC, First-generation, and Low-income students face everyday on this campus. I am aware there needs to be a stop on the passive approach that the school takes on sexual assault and hate crime. I am the best candidate because I have the required work ethic, dedication, and leadership to get the job done. I am the best candidate because I am not afraid to fight for what is needed for my constituents and I. I am the best candidate because I have the passion and commitment that other candidates do not have.",Left-leaning,"Very good; In comparison from last year , there have been several improvements from A.S. Senate. Their work on supporting sexual survivors and working to make UCSB a sanctuary campus are a few of the student’s needs that A.S. Senate has addressed. The progress they have done throughout the year has been undoubtedly very good. However, in every space there is always room for improvement. Going into next year, I believe there should be more collaborative work done between A.S. Senate and the general student body in order to address more of the student’s needs.","Yes; Definitely, there has to be a resolution in divesting from those companies. We are a student body who emphasize diversity and inclusion, it would be hypocritical of us to continue
supporting these companies that profit from the violation of human rights. Instead, the UC should take the money invested and put it towards resources for students.","Yes; Higher education, in general, should have no price. The high tuition of higher education discriminates and puts low-income students in a disadvantage. Implementing a tuition-free university will set forth a progressive and diverse system in our campus. The California Higher Education Master Plan always meant for the UC to be tuition free and we should return to that.","As a student who struggles with mental health, I believe that UCSB has a lot of improvement to do within its mental health services. Yes, we have CAPS, CARE, and Health and Wellness, however the support becomes minimal compared to the thousands of students who struggle with mental health on this campus. The inadequacy of these centers becomes apparent when observing the lack of availability to assist students in a timely manner. There has to be an increase in specialists working in these departments in order to have efficient personnel to aid UCSB students. The university has an issue of doing the bare minimum in addressing and acknowledging the mental health issues of its students. The expensive fees we pay should be used towards the improvements of these centers. Our mental health and our well-being should be the number one priority of the university.","The university handled the situation very poorly, the lack of importance they gave to this unfortunate and horrible act was clearly seen. Not only did they fail to keep their students safe, but they failed in recognizing the survivors by not addressing the issue sooner. It is a situation that showcases the inadequate work ethic and the inability of the university to handle circumstances like the one that happend last Fall Quarter. Obviously, this should come as a learning experience for the university. Their priority should not fall on keeping the identity of an abuser hidden, their priority should be on acknowledging survivors and keeping their students safe from any harm.","It becomes obvious that Title IX is an inadequate system to address sexual assault. From previous circumstances, like last fall quarter, Title IX continues to showcase a failed system that poorly acknowledges the constant sexual attacks happening in our universities. Not only does it fail to recognize survivors, but it fails to hold perpetrators accountable for their violent crimes. In light of recent events, I believe there should be a system in place that makes the process of addressing the event much quicker. These are situations that should be handled with top priority.","I believe that the school has not effectively served all underrepresented communities, although I cannot speak for the communities I am not part of. However, being a member of the LGBTQ+ and Latinx community, I see very minimal support coming from UCSB towards these underrepresented groups. Although there are some resources and centers established for these groups, such as the RCSGD, El Centro, and the Multicultural Center, there are still improvements to be done within these spaces. At a disadvantage for being underrepresented on campus, the resources given do not become as efficient as the university believes. There should be an implementation of bigger spaces, more staff members for these centers, and a larger platform for these communities to be heard. There should be a shift in the way the school acknowledges the struggles of their underrepresented communities.","As senator, I plan to address and advocate for an adjustment in the living and tuition cost of the university. It is an action that will take time to process, as it is an issue that needs to be discussed and worked upon before any changes can be made.However, before those adjustments are made or implemented, a bill or resolution that I will work upon is in creating a faster and more efficient system in obtaining emergency grants. Not only will there be a better system, but there would be more opportunities for students to get these grants. These grants will be given without the need of an eviction letter or detailed documentation.These grants will serve to help students with food and housing insecurities.","I, as an average student, have not been able to easily access the works of A.S. throughout the year. It is a situation that many students on campus share as well. It most definitely is an issue that needs to be resolved and improved.
In order to keep the student body connected and informed with the new works, I believe that an app could be implemented. This app could have similar features as google drive, with different folders that contain updated information from the different departments of A.S. The app could also have a main page that has important dates posted constantly with having the option of getting notified. This app would serve as an entire drive that showcases updates with events, new bills, and resolutions.
Having one on one interactions with individuals becomes difficult to do and reaching through social media is not efficient. However, this app could become the main platform for UCSB and A.S. to reach students in a bigger group. The app can be promoted within the dorms and Isla Vista housing for students to be aware of it. Nevertheless, this app will help improve student interaction with the Senate and its works.","As an advocate for social justice, my priorities stand in creating inclusion and fighting for people’s rights. Janet Napolitano has entirely done the opposite of being supportive towards students demands. For the next UC President, we need an individual who actually works with students on resolving issues such as COLA for graduate students. We need a UC President that understands the disadvantages and struggles that several students face day to day. Someone that not only understands these struggles, but someone who will do the required changes to implement equity within every campus.",,,,,,,
Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan,sofia,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Esmeralda-Carolina-Quintero-Cubillan-2.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,3rd,"Political Science and Sociology 
",,,"I am running for senate’s off-campus senator position because my experiences and disappointment with UCSB’s response to issues pertaining to students in Isla Vista and the larger community were left at a cliff-hanger. Some of the issues IV faces are still present today, things regarding policing versus self-regulating as it pertains to former situations with IFC and other campus organizations, to our campus administration focusing its attention around survivors, and not centering survivors. These issues, and more, are just a glimpse into the fragmented community and relationship UCSB, Senate, and other entities continue to balance, but do not clearly address. Associated Students is the most powerful student-led and student-run organizations on-campus. We have seen organizations thrive the most on this campus when it is reflective of the diverse backgrounds its general body comprises of, not when it is overrepresented of students that do not reflect the many different backgrounds. I am running for senate out of my concern for myself, the safety of our communities, and for the empowerment and delivery of our student body and its needs. 
","My involvement with the on-campus and Isla Vista community has been centered around the creation and maintenance of safe spaces. Currently, I serve as the Co-Chair of La Familia de Colores the only queer/trans* Latinx organization on campus, and the largest queer and trans people of color orientated organization. Concurrently, I also serve as the External Chair of M.U.J.E.R., an organization dedicated to the equitable access of education and justice for marginalized genders, women, and womyn aligned folk. I have repeatedly demonstrated my capacity and dedication to the UCSB community through organizational work. Requiring time management and partnership with different entities on campus or in the community.

Lastly, my most recent involvement was emerging as the founding mother and President of Zeta Sigma Nu UCSB’s only QTPOC Co-ed sorority, as well as being the co-founder of the Zoraida Reyes Fund and QTPOC Emergency fund. My experience in community building and development, organizational management, and interpersonal communication are all skills necessary to capitalize on the collective power and potential of Associated Students to do more good. I am a firm believer in bringing those who are not currently in the community to invite them to the table to help build a longer table with more seats. And I hope to transform A.S. Senate into something similar, bringing young aspiring leaders into positions of leadership to better our community as a whole.
","If elected, the first three resolutions I would introduce would center student’s cost of living in Isla Vista, working with IVTU addressing rent control, and food security. TThe first resolution I want to introduce is around rent control as I strongly support rent CONTROL in Isla Vista and would utilize my senator position to further that work. Students cannot continue to struggle to make ends meet with outrageous rent prices, and by collaborating with the external Vice-President of Local Affairs and the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors, I believe is essential in mitigating conversations inclusive of student needs and experiences. Secondly, a resolution denouncing the food waste of the dining commons should be passed with the stipulation that Associated Students Food Bank should be in partnership to redistribute food prepared by the dining commons in order to prevent additional food waste while tackling food insecurity. Thirdly, a resolution in support of marginalized students on the basis of identity to showcase that Associated Students is greater than a separated body, but an institution dedicated towards the promotion of student success regardless of background. 
","In my platform, I specify five main objectives such as accountability and accessibility of Associated Students Senators. I really want to introduce a student representative role specifically from A.S. to the Financial Crisis Response Team, so that the Senate and A.S. at large are in communications with students’ needs.  I aim to do this through the introduction of mandatory tabling for senators in common campus spaces and expanded office hours to make senators truly accessible to their constituents. Secondly, reform of the Associated Students Emergency Loans to increase from a maximum of 600$ to 1,000$, and to emphasize, by NOT increasing student fees. Mainly through a partnership with the existing committee and the Office of Student Life, Internal Vice-President, and my fellow senators. Thirdly, empowering marginalized communities and connecting them to the senate through the development of additional student leadership councils such as Queer Leadership Council and Black Leadership Council. Senators with specific cultural backgrounds working in tandem with their respective student councils to ensure their voices and needs are being met by the Senate. Fourthly, in cooperation with the Isla Vista Tennant’s Union and the External Vice-President of Local Affairs to push for the passage of rent control in Isla Vista mainly through using our power and leverage as students to benefit our staff and the teaching assistants that work tirelessly to uphold our standard of education, to the families of Isla Vista and Goleta that are suffering from gentrification brought on by students being crammed into Isla Vista. Finally, tackling the issue of food and housing insecurity through facilitating discussions and teamwork between UCSB affiliated vendors (i.e. The Arbor) and the Santa Barbara Housing Cooperative to hold vendor units accountable for food waste, and to assist in the prioritization of housing insecure students. 
","I hope to work with different entities on campus such as the Executives board of Associated Students to achieve greater success in the tackling of food and housing insecurity. Specifically, with the Internal Vice-President and the External Vice-President of Local Affairs. Furthermore, partnership with the Office of Student Life is imperative if we seek to empower marginalized communities whether it be through direct support or institutionally with collaboration with EOP and the Cultural Resource Centers.
","As I mentioned expanding in-person tabling, I want to adopt this same mentality in digital tabling. This would look like “class raps” to professors, or reaching out to departments, to make myself readily available to not only my constituents but to all students. Through this, I plan on making not only my personal social media but utilize UCSB and AS social media platforms to make my contact information accessible.

Mama my DMs are open. 
","I believe I am the best candidate for Off-Campus Senator as I have shown dedication and passion for my community on-campus and in Isla Vista. Whether it be through my community work through my campus affiliated organizations, or developing partnerships with different groups on campus. I believe in the potential of our student body, and my experiences in surveying and addressing student needs can best situate me to continue uplifting and supporting students at the biggest table on campus -- Senate. ",Leftist ,"Good; While I think AS Senate has passed some good resolutions and taken action to protect students on campus such as reissuing our commitment to being a sanctuary campus. However, there could be more done to take into consideration the ongoing issues in Isla Vista such as transphobia, homophobia, and xenophobia. 
","Yes; I believe it is essential to divest our student feeds from the human rights violations taking place in Israel and Palestine. It is incomprehensible that the school would allow for our funds to be utilized in a way that directly correlates to the harm of others, while continuously failing to ensure students are being taken care of here on campus. 

","Yes; Education should not be reliant on one’s income as it ignores generations of income inequality, the legacy of racism and slavery, and current efforts to weed out marginalized communities attempting upward mobility. Often students become concerned with the quality of their education when discussing tuition-free higher education, however, UCSB as a billion-dollar institution is capable of undertaking this.
","The current state of CAPS is no longer capable of maintaining the overwhelming need of the student body. So yes, I believe that the services are adequate, we have competent psychologists and supportive staff, yet it is not adequate in addressing the student demand. While this is not at the fault of the facility, we should be reviewing how we as student leaders can work with administration, UCSA, UCOP and other entities to configure how the university can best support CAPS therapists and psychologists. Regardless, CAPS must do more to bring in more mental health care professionals who inhabit Black, brown, queer, and trans* identities, but all students as this year have proven its rough start. Furthermore, the amount of staff in proportion to students in need of CAPS is unfair and negligent. CAPS budget must be increased and as should there staff with the expectation they must hire a more representative staff. 
","What’s most important to acknowledge this situation, was the lack of communication and connection between administration, UCPD, and the general UCSB community (and its twitter-sphere). By this, I believe that there was much space in between the university’s opportunity to respond to the situation, and when students took matters into their own hands to protect one another and the larger IV community. The administration’s approach towards acts of violence was utterly reprehensible. Not only failing to inform vulnerable populations of the ongoing issues associated with the fraternities. However, it would be incorrect to hold only administration accountable as there were failures on multiple fronts such as Associated Students and the Mental Health town hall that followed. It seemed as though it was more reactionary than responsive to the student's criticism and concern. For example, one topic that was brought up was the UCPD’s self-defense training, but what failed to address was how the program excluding trans* and gender non-conforming, and masculine-identified folks. There needs to be an improvement in procedures when multiple allegations are brought forward to specific organizations, and more specifically not allowing said/accused organizations harbor their allegations to decide how one remediates and/or polices their organization. In the case of the Inter-Fraternity Council being the entity to decide on how to approach these issues in the future is both nonsense and irresponsible of the university. It would be wrong to say that the measures that were taken forth were not taken in good faith, however, we have to hold ourselves, and each other accountable on an equitable and reasonable playing field; and that is, it was not adequate, nor reasonable, nor equitable -- to the survivors, the community, and the student body at large. While we as a community and forum cannot continue to simply call out fraternities and other organizations for their toxic and violent behaviors, we need to imagine the possibility of restorative justice while protecting and empowering survivors of violence.",Title IX offers students the opportunity to come forward and report their trauma but often lacks the proper procedures afterward to ensure that students are receiving the necessary care. Far too often Title IX leaves survivors in the dark without thoughtful attempts at transparency. Title IX needs to be revised in a way that allows for ,"No. We have repeatedly witnessed failures to serve these populations. Beyond looking at statistics of campus community groups and backgrounds, I want to highlight the number of ADMITTED and CURRENT UCSB Indigenous students, less than 1%. To put that in context, there are less than 10 (TEN) indigenous-identifying students on a campus of 25,000+ students. This is just a glimpse into the numbers, but how about campus climate and how UCSB is serving to address and uplift those concerns. Whether it be in the face of transphobic language by established organizations or hate crimes being perpetrated against our communities was poorly handled. As the university qualifies as a Hispanic Serving Institute and Asian American Pacific Islander Serving Institute, we receive a grant that is intended to be used in order to uplift these communities. Yet there is not much transparency in terms of where the funds are allocated. The same is true for Undocumented Students, who are forced to utilize the Monarch lounge are relegated to a portable. Lastly, Muslim students and the prayer space they have been asking and organizing around for the last couple+ years. The RCSGD has been fighting for expansion for multiple years, the Office of Black Student Development was only conceived after years of work. The Indigenous community on campus also deserves more recognition beyond the Chumash Garden and Tree of Peace. Pointedly, our communities deserve better. When we bring in the most marginalized in the community and uplift their success the institution will benefit as a whole. Whether it be the school’s official rankings or in terms of student satisfaction, “effective representation” goes beyond just having high numbers of diversity and inclusion, but material and social resources to help carry those numbers to completion and support retention.","The first resolution I would like to author would be in support of rent control in Isla Vista or denouncing food waste in the dining commons. The cost of housing compounded by student wages, and accessibility. The amount of food waste coming from the dining commons Is both not in line with our values as a campus. A 2015 study conducted by UC Global Food Initiative stated that 42% of students reported being food insecure, with students of color, queer students, and first-generation students being most affected. As students continue to struggle to pay predatory rent prices they must choose between sustenance or shelter. This is unacceptable and as a representative union for students, we must pass resolutions in support of the 23,000+ (US Census 2010) students, staff, faculty, and community members in the Isla Vista/Goleta area.","Associated Students could do a few things to be more accessible students such as expanding the expectation office hours to include tabling. Furthermore, there should be effective checks to see how senators have followed through on their platforms as proposed by Senator Segura-Esquivel, the Senate Tracker that the Nexus has created to hold them accountable. We need to institutionalize that within A.S. and make it commonly accessible to student organizations and campus entities. Also, the Associated Student senate should be expanded to include more senators from all the appropriate populations. Meaning additional on-campus, off-campus, transfer and collegiate senators would be added. A more representative senate would provide for better outreach of targeted populations and bring awareness to the student body of the actual working of the senate and subcommittees. ","There are a number of issues facing the UC system as a whole. Rising tuition cost, housing shortages, contract negotiations, and so on. Students need to utilize their leverage to urge for the replacement of Napolitano to be pro-student and pro-labor in a way that is not just in name. The firing of UCSC graduate students during the Cost of Living Adjustment movement is an attitude we can tolerate to continue. Neither do we benefit from a UC President that will not support staff and their proper pay. Our education quality is directly correlated to the important work done by the cooks, custodians, and facilities workers every UC campus relies on. And acknowledging our use of Black and brown labor to maintain our campuses is crucial considering the ignorance towards their situations. The University of California is the largest employer in the state of California and thus sets precedent for how to treat employees. Especially in the time of a Pandemic and placing strict requirements for student workers, staff, and faculty to access their rightful sick pay is telling of the institution’s predatory relationship with the very folks that maintain it.

Eileen Tran,sofia,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eileen-Tran-2.jpg,,She/Her/Hers,3rd,Biology,,,My name is Eileen Tran and I am currently a Biology major at UCSB. I am running to be a senator to get more involved with school life and to be a voice and resource for others when they don’t know where to turn to but want to be heard. I think many students on campus have questions or need help but don’t know where to go or where to get this help. I plan on making myself as available as possible and being in the Senate will give me more access to make the changes I believe will benefit all of the gaucho community. I have many ideas that I am excited to share to improve campus life and life in Isla Vista.,"On campus I am involved with the Biomentor program at UCSB. This entails helping a group of sophomore Biology majors at UCSB with their MCDB classes. In the program they stressed to us the importance of not only being a tutor but being a mentor to help students in all aspects of their life. In addition, I am part of the UCSB Red Cross Club as part of the event planning committee to help organize fundraisers, blood drives, and volunteering events where all the money made goes back to the Red Cross Foundation. These experiences have taught me how to plan and execute an event as well as how to listen to general concerns and come up with the best way to help.","One of the platforms I am most passionate about is rent control in Isla Vista. After living in Isla Vista for 2 years, I’ve noticed from year to year rent prices are increasing making it hard for students to afford living close to campus. I hope to work with the Isla Vista Tenants Union to try to limit rent prices from increasing over 20% year to year to hopefully reduce any financial stress students are experiencing. In addition, I hope to create an off campus location for the food bank in Isla Vista to make it easier for students to access free food during the weekend since the on campus food bank is only open during weekdays. Also, I would like to expand the amount of meal tickets given out each quarter since much of the food in the dining halls end up going to waste. Lastly, I hope to expand study spaces to Isla Vista with Wifi access to make it easier for off campus students to have a quiet study space without having to go all the way to the library, especially since biking home late at night could make many students feel unsafe in their environment.","My platform entails doing everything I can to improve student life at UCSB. This entails creating a location for a food bank in IV to combat food insecurity for Isla Vista residents as well as allow for increased distribution of meal tickets, working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and EVPLA to establish a rent cap so rent can only be increased up to 20%, increasing affordable parking spaces on campus for those who have to drive to school, expanding Wifi and study spaces to IV and integrating other major insurance companies into student health. I also plan on getting imput from students to see their opinion on what resolutions they want me to work on.","I hope to work with the Isla Vista Tenants union to come up with a rent cap so leasing companies can’t increase rent prices over 20% year to year. In addition, I hope to make this organization more know to students living in Isla Vista so they know where to turn to when many landlords take a majority of the security deposit at the end of the year or when landlords refuse to fix essential items in the space.",I will make a personal Senate facebook and instagram page with my school email listed so that students can access me at any time through social media through direct/personal messages as well as holding online office hours.,"I am a very driven and hard working person so I believe being in the Senate will give me the ability to make changes I want to see on campus. I plan on prioritizing my time to listen to students' concerns to come up with the best resolution to solve their problems. I believe I can add diversity to the 71st Senate since all senators have a different group they can reach thus, having a large diversity is important to represent UCSB as a whole.",Left-leaning,"Good; I believe that the 70th AS senate has done a very good job at addressing student needs. Resolutions such as the resolution to defeat stigma around mental health, the bill to develop a basic needs resource center and the bill for book grants are all examples of how the AS senate has been working to improve student life. 
",I am not fully informed on the whole situation so I prefer not to answer until I am fully educated.,"Yes; I do believe UCSB should be tuition free so that students have access to high education as initially intended in the California Higher Education Master Plan. While student fees have served as the base for the resources our students need, I believe grants and scholarships should be expanded to support low income students”","I do not believe mental health services at UCSB are adequate. While we do have the CAPS program, most times appointments are filled up until a month later so students aren’t able to get immediate help if they need it. I think UCSB should expand the CAPS program by hiring more psychiatrists, therapists, and mental health peer advisors so more appointments are available to students. Also, the school should do their best to advertise other mental health programs on campus that most students don’t know about such as social workers, crisis hotline, and Student Mental Health Coordination Services so students have another place to go instead of just CAPS.",I believe the university could have handled the situation better. As a female student at UCSB I felt as though I was thoroughly informed of what was happening. In cases of sexual assault I think that the school should have responded faster to students’ needs and concerns as well as send out emails to the whole student body informing them of the current situation without releasing any private details about the parties involved. In addition I believe the school should make a greater effort to put together more support groups for sexual assault survivors so they have a place to to open up about their experience if they choose to do so.,"Title IX prohibits sexual discrimination at federally funded educational programs. As seen from this following year, there has been multiple sexual assault cases where the school has not been responding in an adaquate manner. In addition, Title IX only address sexual assault cases after it has occured, thus I believe the school can make a greater effort to put together support groups for sexual assult survivors to make it easier for them to cope after their experiences.",I believe UCSB has done its best to serve historically underrepresented groups however there is always more that could be done. When representing these groups it’s important to hear directly from them what changes they want to see on campus. I hope to attend some of their meetings to hear the opinions of all groups on campus so I can have a better idea of how to represent the community as a whole.,"As a senator I would like to work on a rent control bill/resolution to keep rent prices low in Isla Vista. Every year major leasing companies are monopolizing houses in Isla Vista, thus companies are able to increase rent prices every year causing a financial burden on students. Many students aren’t fortunate enough to get financial help from their parents, thus with high tuition rates and student fees this causes extra stress on students on top of their academic work. I plan on working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union to pass a bill preventing leasing companies from increasing total rent over 20% from year to year.","As a senator I would create an Instagram and Facebook page to inform students about what Associated Students are doing for the school. In addition, the page will have all senators office hours as well as their contact information such as their school email and possibly phone numbers. I plan to post a lot through my personal social media to let people know I am available at all times to listen to what they have to say.","Top priorities for the next UC president should be focused on how to deal with the ongoing coronavirus situation and how to transition students back from remote instruction to in person instruction and how to help students who are having any financial troubles due to the economic recession as a consequence of the pandemic outbreak. In addition, I believe the COLA movement needs to be addressed because the strike was interrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.",,,,,,,
Emanuel Roman,holly,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Manny-Roman.jpeg,,He/Him/His,3rd ,Sociology & Feminist Studies,,,"I decided to run as an Off-Campus senator because I believe in the power of
change and that such change occurs within the students. As someone who is apart
of multiple marginalized and misrepresented communities, I felt it was imperative
to further the change occurring.
○ As a third-year, I have witnessed many subtle and blatant injustices on and
off-campus, with minimal action on behalf of the administration and of those who
represent us. I was compelled to demand that things improve, not for the sake of
this university, but because student lives depend on it. About half of the students
at UCSB are food insecure. What is UCSB doing about this? When it comes to
the lives of Trans* and Queer people of color, what are the campus and its
administration doing to protect and support their livelihood? I believe
accountability and action are what is going to create such change.","During my time here at UCSB, I joined multiple orgs on campus that allowed me to feel
comfortable and accepted on campus. In my second year, I served on A.S. Queer
Commission as Outreach Coordinator, and am currently serving as the Vice (Pride)
Co-Chair. As Pride Co-Chair, it is my duty to demonstrate the fact that LGBTQ+ folk
exist on this campus and the fabulousness of it. I also am the Educational Coordinator of
A.S. S.C.O.R.E. (Student Committee on Racial Equity). My position entails holding
workshops and other informative programs that display and uphold ethnoracial issues on
campus, how we can improve the livelihoods of these racial groups, while also showing
student-accomplishments over the years.","Three resolutions I would like to introduce while in office would be
● A resolution that battles food insecurity at UCSB. Seeing that about half of UCSB
students are food insecure, this is something that UCSB needs to deal with on a
greater scale.

● A resolution that promotes deeper involvement of international students. Since
international students make up a big portion of the student population, they also
need proper representation and visibility; whether that is increasing funding,
grants, promoting clubs and organizations; and supporting them academically,
too.
● Encouraging a once-a-year grant (per student) that they are allowed to utilize in
case their bike or skateboard is stolen. This grant would allow (up to a certain
amount) the student to purchase a new bike, without adding any more financial
stress onto them.
","○ INSTALLING ​emergency- lights stations around IV. It can provide temporary relief for those who need it.
○ WORK ​with the office of the President and the Transportation & Parking Services (TPS) to configure cost-efficient solutions of on-campus parking for students.
○ EXPAND​ the Metro Services by working with Santa Barbara MTD to allow those off-campus more ​efficient​ and ​quicker access​ onto campus, without worrying whether the buses are too full. By reinstating a bus exclusively for those from San Catalina/Sierra Madre/San Joaquin, it will allow them to utilize those buses while giving room for those in IV to use the 24X, 15X, 11 and 27.
○ REINFORCE ​a Resource Center that provides brave spaces for survivors of sexual harassment and sexual violence (SHSV).
○ UNITE​ with the RCSGD, EOP, Food Bank, and the Financial Crisis team to create easier and more tangible access to provide more meal-tickets for those in need.
○ INTEGRATE​ with the Isla Vista Housing Crisis Coalition with the Isla Vista Tenant Union to help lower the overall costs of rent in Isla Vista and hold these property managers accountable.
○ COLLABORATE​ with A.S. Bike Shop to provide a once-a-year grant (ex: Stolen Bike Grant) that will allow a person to choose a bike of their choice from what is available.
"," I plan on collaborating with the Office of the President; EVPLA; TPS; Santa Barbara MTD, the RCSGD; EOP; Food Bank; Financial Crisis Team; Women,
Gender, and Sexual Equity Center; IVHCC; IVTU; CAPS; CARE; AS Bike Shop,
and more.
○ These organizations and entities are vital resources on campus, but ones that need
expansion and more funding/visibility. By working together, we can fulfill the duties in which they were created.","As someone who is online pretty often, I will definitely make myself available. I will be holding office hours throughout the week via Zoom, but also available often via Email. If my constituents are unable to do so, I am also available through social media.","I am someone who is completely and whole-heartedly passionate about what I believe in. I do my best to achieve every goal, and even when I am unable to do my best, I pick myself up and keep going. I genuinely want to make a difference and create change on and off-campus, and I am willing to put the effort to learn and do so.",Left-leaning,"Good;The 70th A.S. Senate has done good work, but not enough. There needed to be more advocacy on behalf of those who’s platforms resulted in their election. I believe Senators, just like anyone else, need to be held accountable and make sure they’re doing their job at the best they can to their abilities.
","Yes;Since I am in support of liberation for all people, I would support divestment legislation. The topic of divestment is a highly complex one and we all need to educate ourselves on the topic before making a definitive answer. However, let it be clear: I am absolutely against any and all forms of anti-semitism, as well. We all need to acknowledge the struggles the Jewish community faces and support them, too."," Yes; I believe this institution and the entire UC system, have the means and funds to be tuition-free.","I believe that UCSB has a foundation, however, I do not believe mental health services are adequate enough. This is not to say that CAPs/CARE is not doing a good job, but with the number of students at UCSB, there simply are not enough resources. If a student is seeking therapy, counseling, or just to speak to a professional, there is typically a 2-3 week wait. This is ridiculous. I get it, there simply are not enough professionals available to assist everyone. But if time-and-time again, mental health has proven to be a dire situation, this university should look into expanding and funding these resources accordingly.","● I absolutely believe that this university could have handled all situations better. The justifications are that the administration simply was unaware of the assaults since it mainly goes through UCPD. However, even in light of the situations, there seemed to be minimal action from the university.
● Reports of sexual assault and other forms of assault occur often and almost every year. How is the university, and the Inter-fraternity council (IFC) handling these situations accordingly? It goes beyond the individual, but into the systems that continue to allow and perpetuate these situations.","Title IX has great intentions and was created to support those who were discriminated against during the times of its creation. Title IX also covers a myriad of cases. However, when it comes to sexual assault, there is an extensive and tedious process that occurs. Many of the times, this dissuades the survivors from coming forward, for it not only puts them in uncomfortable positions, but it also overlooks the capacity of the survivor. Many survivors are unable to come forward right away, and so they most likely did not receive a sexual assault forensic exam. This can delay the process.
● That is only one example. I believe that Title IX needs to improve its system in addressing sexual assault, first by centering and listening to survivors.","I believe that UCSB is moving in the right direction in relation to serving historically underrepresented groups. As a queer, Latinx, first-generation student, there have been spaces that I involved myself that allowed me to feel comfortable and accepted. However, while these spaces might be available, there seems to be a misdirection of equity. Funding for these social spaces and organizations lack when compared to the predominant organizations and groups.
● There needs to be much more funding, visibility, and representation when it comes to these marginalized groups on campus. It goes beyond diversity, but actually including
these groups into these conversations, and making sure they are given the platform to do so, and are actually listened to.","One of the bills I want to pass, in collaboration with other senators and administration, is providing proper physical campus space for those in need. The facility for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD); The Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Center; CARE; CAPS; etc. By expanding these centers, it will allow for growth, healing, prosperity and for students to prevail.","For one, improving the website. It can be very inaccessible, and minutes for every A.S. entities are not always updated weekly or quarterly. Two, collaborating with student organizations. The student involvement is extremely high, and by merging with student organizations off and on-campus, it will demonstrate that although we are senators, we are also students.","Top priorities for the next UC president would, ideally, be someone who centers students and workers first (both undergraduates and graduate students). With COLA going on at this very moment, and the shameful actions on behalf of President Napolitano and UCSC Admin, it is clear that the lives of students are not being prioritized, but rather deemed as commodity and profit.
● The next UC President should encourage and promote an increase of the amount of grants/scholarships for incoming students, but also for ongoing students. They should prioritize UC workers, especially those whose jobs are undermined and overlooked (e.g. the AFSCME 3299 union).",,,,,,,
Andy Arciaga,holly,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Andy-Arciaga.jpg,,​she/her/they/them,3rd, Psychology & Brain Science (with a minor in Applied Psychology),,,"I am running as your next Off-Campus Senator because I believe I am able to make meaningful, tangible changes. I consider myself to be very fortunate, like most of you, to be here at UCSB where I feel like I belong for the first time. As a transfer student, it was very daunting for me to move into a brand new and unknown world, but I have been warmingly welcomed by communities here that do not exist in the small town where I came from. The students and friends that I interact with inspire me to take on the challenges and victories that come with being a senator. AS Senate leads in changes that we want to see and has the power to make decisions that impact us. I am passionate in making our school a community that welcomes all identities, creates safe spaces and resources for all, and fosters both academic and personal excellence. I am motivated to advocate for and serve students at all levels. I want to be a part of the change that makes our school greater than it already is, and I won’t wait for someone else to do it. I am here, and I am ready and willing to take on the job.","I’m a member of Kapatirang Pilipino’s (KP) Political Committee. My involvement with the committee, and the club in its entirety, has taught me the importance of understanding the effects of intersecting identities on finances and access to resources. Intersecting identities are never independent of each other. It creates multiple sources of disadvantages. As of 2020, UCSB is the fourth most diverse UC college, but I still feel like there aren’t enough resources that recognize the unique experiences of our diverse student body, especially on identities that overlap. We can’t expect students to excel academically and personally when substantial resources that help and support them are not accessible or don’t exist at all. I am also a student staff at the Pardall Center, where I interact and engage with students of UCSB and community members of Isla Vista. Despite our brief interactions, I understand the struggles of both populations, especially students who have issues with their landlords. This unique experience makes me especially equipped to hold the position as an Off-Campus Senator because I understand their struggles and can effectively advocate for them and their needs. Through Kapatirang Pilipino and as a student staff at Pardall Center, I have been exposed to various issues students face on a daily basis. This shaped my platform of what
    
I think UCSB students need and deserve, and I believe I am that person that can help
them achieve this and more.","The first bill I plan to introduce is regarding mental health services. I believe CAPS can be a greater resource if we expanded what they can offer. By working with other entities, like AS Public & Mental Health Commission and Commission on Student Well-Being, I hope we can increase the number of clinicians available and bring CAPS in Isla Vista. I would also want clinicians who specialize specifically in dealing with issues of underrepresented groups, like the LGTBQ+ and Black community, and clinicians who are specific to first years and transfer students. I also would like to introduce a bill that makes course materials affordable, collaborating with AS Book Bank to make this happen. Textbooks, course readers, and test materials are essential in our learning process. They are required by most, if not all, courses offered at UCSB. Students already face difficulty in paying for other expenses, like housing and food. They shouldn’t have to be burdened by the additional cost of course materials. Switching to open educational resources, like the textbooks some of us are using this Spring quarter, is just one step towards that bill. Lastly, I plan to introduce a bill and work with the EVPLA office to help solve the housing issues in Isla Vista. Working at the Pardall Center, I have seen students come in time and time again for the same issues. Students, and no one in general, should have to experience landlords abusing their power. We need to hold them accountable for their wrongdoings and lack of attentiveness to their tenants’ needs like overcharging their tenants and the lack of attention to the molding issue.","I am a big advocate for resources! I know a few people, including myself, have had a hard time being accommodated at CAPS. Students believe that the wait line is too long and most times appointments are not scheduled until weeks later. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and we should make this equally accessible for everyone. These are a few reasons as to why one of the first bills I plan to author revolves around mental health services on campus, focusing on CAPS. I also plan on working with the Food Bank to move into Isla Vista and creating and/or increasing resources for marginalized identities and transfer students. Examples of the latter would be food and financial literacy, CLAS specific for transfer students, clinicians who specialize in issues and culture of marginalized identities, and more assistive technology for disabled students. I also want to help students in Isla Vista by working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union to resolve housing issues, such as communication and the power dynamic between landlord and tenants. I will make myself available to anyone as much as I physically and mentally can. I want to be transparent in the things that I do and the plans
that I have. Working closely with organizations, entities, and students will ensure that
students from all levels are represented and heard. No one gets left behind.","One of my platforms that I am most passionate about is resource accessibility. I want to bring CAPS and AS Food Bank in Isla Vista to make both resources equally accessible for students who are living off-campus. With that platform in mind, I hope to work with AS Public & Mental Health Commission, Commission on Student Well-Being, Zero Waste, and most importantly CAPS and AS Food Bank. I believe these specific entities are crucial in our ability in bringing on-campus resources in Isla Vista. I also want to increase resources for marginalized identities. For instance, implementing transfer students-specific CLAS, pushing for gender neutral bathrooms, and increasing assistive technology for disabled students. For these, I hope to work with Transfer Student Alliance, Commission on Disabled Equality, and Queer and Womxn’s Commissions, to name a few. I hope to work with them to support them on their on-going and planned projects and to help them in getting the resources they need. Lastly, I hope to work with other senators, both on- and off-campus, and Presidential candidate Daniel Segura. While we may differ in goals and ideals, we are here to advocate for and serve the entire student body, not just the select few we identify with. I hope we get to collaboratively work together and support each other in making a community that puts students first.","It all comes down to the specific rules enforced during summer and fall quarter. I will be living in Isla Vista for the next school year, so I would prefer, and want, to have in-person meetings. However, if shelter-in-place is still in effect, there are many resources online that I can use to make myself available. As old as I sound, emails are the first thing I check in the morning, so I would not have any problems missing any. For a more collaborative approach, we can substitute in-person meetings with online meetings through Zoom or Google Hangouts. While Zoom isn’t often reliable, with the possibility of crashing and Zoom bombing incidents, I am looking for a platform that’s highly secured and can easily be accessed. However, if messages or issues are time sensitive, I can be reached through text messaging apps like GroupMe or Flock. I am not an advocate for Slack, due to its investors whose beliefs I do not align with, and would prefer other forms of messaging communication. There are other resources that I’m not used to, but I’m great at adapting to new situations. Also, I am not only available to my constituents but to students as well. I want to be another source for all especially for students who might not know where to specifically go.","Because of my job at the Pardall Center, I am able to interact with various aspects of student life. This gives me an understanding of what students are satisfied and upset with and what students really need, which will allow me to effectively serve you as your next Off-Campus Senator. Before the opportunity of running even presented itself, I have been thinking of ideas and solutions that I believe would benefit many, if not all, of UCSB, which I hope to share with you and act on in the upcoming school year. This shows that I have been determined in serving the student body and making meaningful, tangible changes since day one. Also, as a queer, Asian woman who’s a transfer student, I have personally seen where the university fails and needs improvement, like many other marginalized students have. We are all equally deserving to have a seat at the table, and I know I am someone who is not afraid to speak up and fight for this belief. I am dedicated to ensuring that all identities are heard and represented and that the institution that you pay for effectively works for you.",Other: Progressive,"Good; A.S. Senate was able to work efficiently, which is reflected in Fall Quarter’s Bills and Resolutions. I’m satisfied with the bills passed. Though I wish some resolutions, specifically regarding destigmatizing mental health, were followed by bills.","Yes; I would vote for a resolution inline with BDS. We can’t continue to support companies that still have ties to Israel. Doing so makes us complicit in their crimes against Palestine. Instead of investing in international companies, the UC could put that money towards resources students need like mental health services, zero emission transportations, and open educational resources.","Yes;Higher education should be a right for everyone, not just the privileged few. In-state UCSB students pay about $15,000 for tuition and are still expected to pay for housing, food, and other essential school supplies. The California Higher Education Master Plan intended the University of California to be tuition-free and our state needs to reinvest in our students. Financial help does exist for those that meet the requirement, but sometimes that with loans and scholarships, there still isn’t enough money to cover other expenses. Students are then faced with other issues like food insecurity and homelessness. Instead, the money should go to support and improve the resources that we have on campus.","No, the mental health services on campus are not adequate. CAPS needs to be a lot more accessible. There’s a total of 8 CAPS locations, which are open for 38 hours a week. The availability isn’t sufficient considering the number of students that attend our school. First, they should be open past 4:30PM, especially on Wednesdays and Thursdays when they’re open at a later time. With extended hours, we should be hiring more clinicians as well. Second, certain clinicians should be assigned to first years, transfer students and non-traditional students. We should also add locations, or move existing locations, in areas with a heavy population of students like them. Adjusting to a new environment can be difficult, even for a transfer student like me. Having mental health support will help students in transitioning and support their academic success as well. Third, we should add another location in Isla Vista, besides the pre-existing one in Gaucho Support Center, since it’s where most students live and/or frequent. Pardall Center could be one of the spaces where clinicians can come in a few times a week to hold appointment-only sessions. These measures ensure that students who live in Isla Vista have the same access to CAPS as students who live on campus. Outside of CAPS, we should have a free subscription to Headspace, a guided meditation app, and an A.S. position, a senator or a seat on the Executive Board, that deals specifically with students’ mental health and well-being. Let’s cultivate a community that destigmatizes mental health and supports each other because mental health is just as important as physical health.","The university failed to properly deal with the situation. First of all, the university didn’t send out a Timely Warning until two weeks after the incident. From my
understanding, Timely Warnings are sent out as soon as information about an incident is received. Why did it take two weeks for the university to learn and address the incidents? Why did it take two weeks for the fraternity to report the use of date-rape drugs by one of their members? It shows that the systems in place, both in Greek life and in our university, are not efficient and need reformation. Additionally, the Timely Warning email contained victim-blaming rhetoric. Students were given “safety tips,” which further puts the responsibility of the situation on the survivor rather than the perpetrator. Doing so discourages the survivors from reporting and encourages acceptance of both victim-blaming and actions of the perpetrator. Furthermore, a temporary hold on social events and a task force that monitors safe practice were the only steps taken after the incidents. These are inadequate consequences. There should have been an increase in resources and open dialogue that’s readily available, not things students need to seek out for. There should have been concrete actions against the fraternities that ensured incidents like these are not acceptable and shouldn’t happen again.","Looking at events in our school in the past year, I don’t believe that Title IX is an adequate system in addressing sexual assault on UC campuses. The way our university dealt with the reports in Fall Quarter received a lot of outcry and demands from students. The incidents were not immediately reported. There was little to no transparency in the dialogues between the university and organizations involved. The process that followed the reports was slow, and all we got was a task force that monitors safe practice in social events. Also, I know students across UCs that have reported their experiences and were still forced to be in the same space as their assailants. These show that Title IX is failing in supporting and protecting its students, especially the survivors. UC has to add supplemental resources and laws to Title IX. UC has to create a better system that cultivates a safe space, especially for survivors, and a faster and rigid process that supports them. UC needs more transparency with situations like these. Sexual assault has no space in our community. It is not tolerable and should not only be punishable with a slap on the wrist. We deserve actions from UC that supports this and supports us.","No, but I believe UCSB has the ability to do better. There are spaces and resources, such as MCC, EOP, and RCSGD, that support underrepresented groups. However, I believe they don’t have the same opportunities and access to other resources, compared to other groups, outside these spaces. In UCSB’s 2019-2020 campus profile, 65% of admitted undergraduate students, excluding International students, are of non-White identities. Resources like mentioned above can’t accommodate the entire
population. I can’t speak on behalf of the communities of Black, Latinx and other ethnic identities, but I can speak on issues surrounding the Pan Asian and LGBTQ+ community. The Pan Asian community makes up 27% of the UCSB student population. Considering that number, there’s a lack of resources tailored specifically to us and the diverse, and sometimes intersecting, groups within the Asian community. For instance, the Department of Asian American Studies is one of the smallest departments on campus despite the large space we hold. There’s a limited number of faculty, with only eight core faculty members, and courses offered for both undergraduate and graduate students. Furthermore, the belief in model minority is detrimental to our identities and minimizes our mental health. We need clinicians in CAPS that specialize in Asian American issues. We need representation, in general, in UCSB’s paid staff that specialize in our issues and sociocultural contexts.​ ​There are many student-led organizations that are specific to the LGQBT+ community outside of RCSGD and QComm. However, we still feel like we aren’t welcomed in spaces in UCSB and Isla Vista. An example is an incident that occured in Fall Quarter 2019 where a UCSB student assaulted and used homophobic slurs on another student. The assailant was arrested, but he was later released on a misdemeanor and a few hundred-dollar bail. This is an unacceptable response to his actions. It shows that UCSB doesn’t care for and protect the LGBTQ+ community and that beliefs and actions like these are tolerable in our community.","If elected, the first bill I plan to author is expanding resources CAPS has to offer. I’m a big advocate for resource accessibility, and I believe CAPS has the potential to be better. We need to allocate a position in A.S. that deals specifically with CAPS and other resources for students’ mental health and well-being. This would be one of a series of mental health-centered bills I will author. I also want to push for a free subscription to Headspace, a guided meditation app. There are many advantages to meditation, such as reduced stress and improved energy and brain function. Meditating can be daunting and difficult at first, but I’ve found Headspace easy to follow and a maintainable habit. I also want to increase the hours of operation, clinicians available, and locations of CAPS. We need an additional location in Isla Vista to ensure that students both on- and off-campus have the same access to CAPS. Additionally, I will be advocating and fighting for clinicians who specialize in underrepresented groups, such as LGBTQ+, Asian, Black, and Latinx communities. I will also include assigning clinicians to first years and transfer and non-traditional students.","One of the most important ways we can include and inform the student body is through the Internet! I mean, we are in the Digital Age. Some classes run as late, sometimes even later, than 6:30PM. Students might have just gotten out of class or work and want immediate relief by going home. Most organizations hold their meetings this late in the day as well. Students already have the option to watch the Senate meetings online. We just need to promote it better. We can do this by sending weekly text or email reminders, setting up flyers in areas with the most foot traffic, creating a Digiknow, and posting on AS’s social media. Additionally, we should hold bimonthly reverse town hall meetings. This will give students the space to give feedback on the current state and decisions of the Senate and voice what they would like to see on our campus. I would also push for summarized agendas and meetings, supplemental to the current system they have in place, and a monthly recap that is on their website and is sent out to students. We also need to emphasize outreach, especially on first years and transfer students. As a transfer student, I haven’t seen enough information and involvement of the Senate in our community. Outreach will increase said populations’ awareness on who and what A.S. is and potentially lead to future A.S. leaders. Examples of outreach that we can do is targeting low turnout populations, increasing connections between the Senate and organizations, and increasing social media presence and activity. Students need to know that they are heard, represented, and served by people that have their best interest, which will encourage them in working with AS.","The next UC President’s top priorities should include climate change and students’ best interest. Zero Waste is one of current UC President Janet Napolitano’s policies. Her office projected that, by 2020, all UC locations will have their land fill diverted by 90%. It’s commendable that a large institution like UC is taking an initiative in creating changes in institutional levels. However, under Napolitano, individual UCs had the final say in implementing the policy. Leaving this power to UCs, rather than implementing it to all, leaves discrepancy in the effectiveness of the policy. Furthermore, zero waste isn’t only fighting climate change but food insecurity as well, which many college students face. We need a president that has concrete ideas in achieving zero waste and can implement these ideas. We also need a president that will always do right by students. This year’s monumental COLA movement is a prime example. Cost of living dramatically increases every year, making it harder for many, students included, in making ends meet. Under UC, graduate students are being exploited. They are not getting paid enough for the amount of labor they do. Instead of complying to the demands and supporting them, Napolitano fired most UCSC graduate students. Students shouldn’t have to put in situations where they’re forced to make drastic compromises on basic
necessities. Students shouldn’t have to be burdened by rent. We need a president that supports and serves us rather than punishes us.",,,,,,,
Connie Huerta,holly,Off Campus Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Connie-Huerta.jpg,,she/her/hers,3rd,Sociology and Black Studies Double Major with a minor in Spanish,,,"I am running to be a senator with the 71st senate because as a third year student, I have seen the sort of steps student activists have taken to create change on this campus. Although UCSB is always moving forward, that does not mean we as a campus are perfect. In fact, I can acknowledge there are still​ ​many areas that could use improvement. As a student who identifies with many marginalized and underrepresented communities on this campus, I have had the opportunity to get a sense of what groups could use more help and support, especially as our student body is constantly expanding and diversifying, causing campus demographics to change with that. The fact that I come from a low socioeconomic background, an immigrant household, am a first-generation college student, am a Promise Scholar, grew up with poorly funded public education, have felt the second-hand effects of ICE and the prison system, am a queer woman, all contribute to my individual experience and the sort of adversities my peers and I face, which consequently gives me a unique perspective. As a result, I try my best to be considerate of all communities and the way in which society views certain people, which inherently has repercussions on their experience that might contribute to even more layers of hardships as a marginalized student. Because of this, I hope to amplify the voices of these very communities that are constantly overlooked and neglected in order to ensure they have the resources necessary to succeed.","Throughout my time at UCSB, I think my involvement with various organizations
contribute to how prepared I feel to be an AS senator. I started off my involvement by attending conferences such as the Students of Color Conference my first year (as well as this year) and then the Empowering Women of Color Conference my second year. For my second year, this then led to my involvement with SIRRC as a mentor at local high schools, as well as having the opportunity to be Co-Outreach Coordinator with SCORE. For this school year, I was elected to be one of the Co-Chairs for SCORE, and finally had the opportunity to join Underground Scholars at UCSB, an organization I was eager to become more involved with after first hearing about their chapter at UC Berkeley present at the Students of Color Conference. Moreover, I also worked as research assistant with professor Mireille Miller-Young in the Feminist Studies Department Spring 2019, and a high school mentor for an English Learning Development class with School Kids Investigating Language in Life and Society (SKILLS) this past Winter quarter.
   
A specific project I started on during the winter with my position as Co-Chair was a Clothing Drive for students and the greater Isla Vista area by having an area with clean clothes at which people could donate clothes and accessories, or where people could feel free to take as many garments they wish, with complimentary refreshments. Apart from this, we would also donate leftover food we had to students or some of the houseless community in I.V. I would like to expand on this in efforts to work with both our student body and the greater IV community. Through all of this, I have continued to push myself outside my comfort zone, at which I was able to gain experience seeing what leadership looks like both on campus and off campus, all while learning more about the sort of ways in which people give back to their communities. As a result, I see the importance of community work, which is why I believe I have the right intentions in running for senate in efforts to take the knowledge I have gained on the way systemic issues affect different communities because the university as a whole has to show who they really care for by accommodating to every community’s needs appropriately. As senator, I would advocate for the communities that are historically disadvantaged due to the repercussions of the actions of those in power. It is time we listen to the voices of the communities that have been ignored despite being the ones to speak up the longest.","As senator, one of the first bills/resolutions I would like to implement and be a part of is the minimization of police presence on campus, as I do not find it to be an essential part of our education. Having police on campus only perpetuates the systemic disadvantages and discrimination society already places upon the same communities. If we truly care for our students, the prioritization of our education should not be presented through cops patrolling our university, but instead should be shown by providing resources for those who have housing issues, those who are food insecure, those who are worried about how they will afford their books and readers, etcetera. There are better ways to support the quality of our education than by insisting on having police present. Some other resolutions and bills I would like to introduce while in office include would be for topics such as, addressing the Human Rights violations occurring on the land of Palestine, as well as divestment from companies profiting off these violations. It is a shame that it has not been done yet and it is extremely disappointing that we are the only UC that has not decided to divest. Furthermore, I think it is important to address Chancellor Yang’s role in the construction of sacred land at Mauna Kea in Hawai’i. Hawai’i has endured enough by being taken over by the United States, and does not need anymore harm being upon their people, culture, or land. I would also like to pass a project that would allow students much more flexibility with meal swipes. Some changes include things such as allowing people to swipe for meals at non-dining hall locations such as the UCen or arbor, having meal swipes roll over, the ability to swipe students in, and being able to donate swipes whenever people decide to do so, instead of by a certain deadline every week.","My platform is to help provide basic student and community needs to those that could use
the support the most. This is because I understand the repercussions many experience due to the actions of those in power in this country. I do not think many people understand the various communities that are heavily affected by certain laws, policies, and ideologies the government implements. As a result, this leaves marginalized communities having to put in more work than others in efforts to survive through a world that was not made for them and does not have their best interest in mind. Although the system will not change overnight, that does not mean we should let it discourage us from seeking better resources or demanding our presence and hard work be acknowledged. We can begin on this campus by learning from the past and current mistakes of this country. In efforts to do this, I plan to work with and collaborate with organizations that also believe in change for this campus. Student activist groups at UCSB have shown exemplary leadership and dedication to making this place a better education environment and I admire them for that, therefore they should be receiving the utmost support as they are a representation of our student body. Some of these include movements such as the AFSCME UC Worker Strike, Undergrads 4 COLA, “A Rapist in your Path/ Un violador en tu camino” demonstration by MUJER, Sexual Assault Demonstration by Intersectional Feminist Club, and the work BSU put in to have more demands met from the orginal list of demands after the North Hall takeover in 1968. Furthermore, in order to be able to amplify the voices of the most underrepresented communities on this campus and what their exact needs are, I also plan to reach an even greater student body by actively listening to the needs of students at events such as town hall meetings. I want to consider everyone’s voices with their best interest in mind in order to figure out what steps should be taken to find solutions, rather than just state the issues without any sort of intention to mobilize change.","In order to achieve my platform and provide the support that is needed or
underrepresented communities on campus, I hope to work with student activist and community service oriented organizations that I would be able to work with to improve the environment on and off campus. Some of these organizations include but are not limited to: UCSB Student Activist Network, IV Tenants Union, Underground Scholars, Santa Barbara (USSB), Intersectional Feminist Club, La Familia de Colores, Mixed Student Union, and/or SCORE to work toward providing basic student needs. I know many of these organizations are already doing a lot of great work in order to provide in ways the system does not, which is why I feel like organizations like these should be more centered in discussions we have about our campus. In
order to better provide support for communities off campus, I would like to work with organizations such as: Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Mauna Kea Protectors at UCSB, La Escuelita, or Street Health Outreach. However, despite naming these specific organizations, I am open to more groups, as well as anyone and everyone who would like to work and collaborate in order to create a better overall UCSB campus. Every student led organization on this campus matters and I think it is essential to work closely with these groups that constantly work toward representing the student body, particularly those whose voices and concerns are often not prioritized.","Because of the current situation we are in with this global pandemic, everyone has had to
transition and get used to other means of work and communication. Although it would be ideal not to have to worry about aspects of life other than staying healthy, finding employment, paying rent, finding the means to get cleaning supplies, food, taking care of family, etcetera, school can become much more overwhelming than it already is. However, if this were to extend through summer courses and fall quarter, I would have to shift the form at which I plan to accomodate for the needs of students on campus by making myself as available I can to allow peers to contact me if they had any questions or concerns that should be addressed, as well as make myself a resource for my constituents to the best of my ability. I would use social media to advertise possible resources available, as well as making myself available through personal cell, video call, text, etcetera, through personal appointments or according to my office hours depending on my schedule. This way, students do not have to worry about contacting me solely via email, which can get a bit overwhelming and intimidating at times.","Because of the current situation we are in with this global pandemic, everyone has had to

However, there still has not been anything to address: how to incorporate more services for students, the housing crisis, the Chancellor funding construction on sacred land in Hawai’i, or efforts to accommodate for survivors of hate crimes within campus or surrounding campus.","Yes;Yes, I would be in favor of a resolution to divest from companies that profit from human rights violations in the current occupation of Palestine. It is disappointing to see that we are the only ASUC that has not taken these steps despite our education and knowledge of the country’s history. We have the ability to learn about what actually is occurring, yet it does not make sense to me as to why we have not addressed this already.","Yes;UCSB should be tuition-free in order to make higher education more accessible to all people. There is no reason as to why this opportunity should be for the economically privileged because learning is a right, and depriving certain groups from being able to learn is an abuse of power that comes with capital. There should be no restrictions, and education should not be treated as something profitable, but something all people deserve to have access to in order to grow individually to expand their own horizons.”","I do not believe mental health services at UCSB are adequate despite the changes
implemented throughout the years. There are not enough therapists working at CAPS, let alone sufficient representation of our student body. As a result, this affects individual relationships with the students and therapists. Another discrepancy I notice is how the high popularity of CAPS has resulted in a limited amount of visits students are allowed to make, leaving them with the options of only receiving minimal help, or continuing struggling as a student. Mental health conditions students might be experiencing will not be fixed with just a few meetings. If there are going to be such limitations, then the education system as a whole must stop the normalization of overworking its students and draining them mentally. Although some might come into higher education with pre-existing struggles, many people develop conditions that simultaneously hinders their ability to succeed in such a prestigious school. If they refuse to stop overworking college students, then there needs to be more of an effort to make sure there is an expansion of workers so there are enough therapists for all students ​with s​ ufficient representation. If a
 
marginalized student feels like they cannot relate to, or trust the current demographic of therapists that are accessible, it is resulting in the deprivation of resources for them, while increasing the ones for students who most likely already had sufficient access to helpful resources.","I do believe the university could have handled the situation better. This is because of the amount of time it took for them to send out a response, but also because of the lack of information in these emails. Not very much was said about the situation, which should be addressed because how else can we make sure we avoid this to occur again? Incidents like these do not just happen once and then go away, especially if they are aware they can get away with it. In addition, instead of making the fraternity holistically face consequences, there was a workshop for self-defense that was held for those who would be considered more ‘prone’ to this sort of assault. It made it seem like those that should take precautions ​should​ be those that are most scared of something happening to them, which is the complete opposite of what should be done. There is no reason for them to be the ones to have to take precautions out of fear because nobody seems to want to hold the assaulters accountable, which results in no sort of change. Instead, the same people who are experiencing all of this neglect and hardship, are basically being blamed for the actions of others.","I think Title IX has the right intention in wanting to address sexual assault on campuses
because of the way it attempts to protect people from discrimination on the basis of sex. However, the execution might be questionable. Most of the time, it seems as though the university tries to hide the situation by silencing the survivors and protecting the assaulters, resulting in a lack of transparency between the students. Depriving the student body of the information that is occurring within their peers and community is not exactly the right approach as this is something that we must discuss and is imperative we discuss. In addition, enforcing the fact that a police report must be placed is excessive, as that is not what all survivors want and it is not what they all need. The university also does not really make it clear what their steps are to hold these students accountable other than possibly telling the individuals to just avoid each other. Much of the time has zero effect on the assaulters, giving them the leeway to possibly
cause harm to others as well. Instead, since situations like this vary from case to case basis, they should be treated as such as well. There is no ​one w​ ay to address this issue since not everyone wants the same outcome. This meaning that some might not want to relive the experience, some might have reasons as to why they might not want to file a report because of the possible repercussions of going to the police could entail, etcetera. Not all survivors can be treated like they are the same person because they all have their own individual experiences, therefore I believe Title IX could definitely use some improvements, but we also need the universities to take the problem much more seriously.","I think UCSB has taken steps to better serve underrepresented groups on campus, but
many issues are still present. This is because the demands made by marginalized communities are more often than not perceived as, “asking for too much.” The changes that ​have ​occurred on our campus are thanks to the efforts and labor of community organizers and activists on campus. There could definitely be more support for these students, as marginalized communities have historically had so many resources deprived of them. A specific example of this can be with the demands that were made by students who organized the North Hall takeover in 1968 who had a list of demands for the university. Only a select few demands on the list were met, including the establishment of the Black Studies program, but it is unfortunate that Black students on campus are still fighting for more of these demands to be met. Although they have created amazing change and improvement, this is not something to praise the university for, but something the students ​should be praised for, as they are the ones in the forefront putting in all the work by demanding the university does more for students that are alienated, ostracized, and marginalized by society and this campus. The university could also use more implementation to better support students who are undocumented, indigenous, queer, genderqueer, etcetera.","If elected to serve on Senate for the 2020-2021 school year, the first bill I would plan to
author is one that addresses the police presence on campus. This is an issue I am very adamant about since I grew up in an area in which there was a heavy police presence in both middle schools and high schools. As a result, I have seen the harm police can cause both on campus and to the mental health of students, which inherently affects the value of education these students are receiving. As much as students already pay to attend this university, we must provide the safest environment possible and focus on funding student needs rather than police to patrol the
 
school. For a good amount of the student body, police do not mean safety but instead incite fear. Why would students want to attend a university that has police that reminds them that society perceives them as a threat which may inherently make them feel unwanted? Why must these students be forced to relive the traumatizing experiences our communities have endured and continue to experience? If safety is truly a concern, then we can replace the heavy police presence by having more CSO mediators, especially since these would be students working, not a group of people who have a history of misconduct against marginalized communities and experiencing little to no consequences for the harm they cause.","In order to involve the student body and keep them informed about what is going on with
their student government and bills/resolutions passed, the senate can become better accessible by utilizing social media platforms. This is because we know many students and organizations are using these platforms to post updates. In this way, we can use technology, something many students are heavily influenced by and use it to our advantage to make it another means of communication. This way, we can advertise what issues we are focused on which would simultaneously give students a better idea as to what else they would like to see from us for the improvement of our campus. In addition, we could send updates to our Boards Committees and Units, as well as the Office of Student Life organizations, as these are spaces that represent our study body and the various communities that make this campus amazing. As a result, by essentially keeping our student leaders well informed, they can also spread the message within their communities as well, to make sure we reach as much of our student body as possible.","Some of the top priorities for the next UC President is someone who, first of all, rehires
all the graduate students who have been dismissed and also meet the demands of the COLA movement, not just at UCSC, but ​all​ UC campuses. Secondly, we must prioritize an individual whose focus is on the quality of our education and not someone who sees the UC system solely as a business. The president of the UC should not earn their position because of the amount of money they have, but by looking at their intentions with their position, and how they will focus on constantly improving UC campuses. Another prioritization for someone who will be in charge of the UC system should be someone who cares for all communities and the basic needs of students (both undergraduate and graduate students). By doing so, they will make sure the
 
individual UCs would have adequate funding for certain things, such as more affordable education, and provide more resources for underrepresented UC student body needs in order for them to be able to thrive and succeed as a student. If student well being and retention is not something the following UC President cares about, then their priorities are not suitable to be the next leader and should instead seek a job elsewhere.

I want to be someone who isproactively working towards making sure communities that have historically been ignored thefirst to be listened to. I want to show that the UCSB body is very tired of patiently waiting.Becoming a senator will allow me to have that platform that is more accessible to studentscomplaints, ideas, or even just doubts! Working along with other individuals who only want tomake UCSB a better place for all is also another highlight of becoming a senator. Getting intouch with organizations as well as different communities to pass resolutions in solidarity canalso impact a lot of people. I am very passionate about social justice issues and that includeslocal UCSB social justice issues that may have been ignored in the past! I want to face thosechallenges and bring it to light.","I have been involved across many different communities on campus. I served as a volunteer atthe women's center in the Student Resource Building that has educated me on the differentcontraception methods as well as the resources around campus that are offered. As a senator, Iwant to put work towards resources that are offered on campus! I want to make them better andmore accessible than they are right now! For example, the Wellness Vending Machine isoff-campus. I want to try to see if we can get one on campus in order to increase accessibility.Making sure people know that different resources exist within UCSB is what I want to helppublicize. I am also the founder and the president of Intersectional Feminists which is anorganization on campus that educates, stands in solidarity, as well as produces visibility tomarginalized groups. The work that Intersectional Feminists has been doing includes workingwith the UCSB community to understand their concerns to create different types ofdemonstrations, petition, social media education, or solidarity stand. This has taught me how towork with students and produce some type of response in return. Through both being a volunteerand the President of Intersectional Feminists, I have become a leader who stands on a platform inorder to elevate others voices, not my own. As Bernie Sanders says, “Not me, Us.”"," A bill to fund a wellness vending machine on campus
 A resolution condemning hateful transphobic, racist, homophobic, abeilist acts on campus
 A bill to introduce Calfresh use at The corner store, coral tree cafe, the store at buchanon.","One of the things on my platform is to increase the places on campus that accept Calfresh/EBT
SNAP. As of right now, the arbor is the only place that accepts this pay and on some days, the
machine does not work! I really want to get the platform to see steps the UCSB community can
take to increase accessibility to food on campus! This means introducing CalFresh use at Coral
Tree Cafe, the corner store, and other entities on campus! Another platform is providing
resources and support to students who have been impacted by the system or have been
previously incarcerated. Passing a solidarity resolution or continuing to implement a program
that works with USSB (Underground Scholars at SB) that writes letters to incarcerated
individuals to link the school to prison pipelines! We want to show that education can be done
and that there are resources for these incarcerated people to come to after they get out! Using my
platform, I want to work with USSB to see how we can continue to support these students.","I hope to get the opportunity to work with organizations such as CARE to increase solidarity tostudents who experience sexual violence along with Intersectional Feminists! I also want to workwith USSB as well to see how UCSB can better support people who have been impacted by thesystem/have been incarcerated. I want to work with organizations such as Black Quare andRCSGD to increase visibility to marginalized communities and direct resources to them such asfunding.","I would open up different social media platforms, give away a number that they can text withimmediate concerns, as well as begin zoom office hours. I plan to hold zoom office hours to hearstudents out as much as I can. This also includes setting up zoom meetings if that time does notwork out. I also plan to uplift different resources for financial and food insecurities during thistime. This means sharing on different social media platforms!","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I have always been passionate
 about being outspoken and making change in local communities around me and I want to be able
 to continue to do that by becoming a senator at UCSB!",Left-leaning,"Very Good;A.S Senate passed resolutions in support of survivors as well as a resolution in order todestigmatize mental health. These two resolutions are extremely important in our campus culturethis year because of hateful acts that have been happening. The Senate passing these resolutionsreally sends the message of solidarity and I really stand with that.","Ye​s;UC Santa Barbara is one of the last to divest from companies that profit off of human rightsviolations. I believe as a community, we need to do the right thing and divest from companiesthat take part in war crimes such as Raytheon as well. UCSB, should take stance with other UCschools and show that we will not support companies that profit off of death and apartheid. It isour right as humans as well as students in higher education to divest from any company thatprofits off human rights violations."," YesTuition is increasing expeditiously and should be free. When tuition rises, it decreasesaccessibility to marginalized students such as formerly incarcerated students, undocumentedstudents, and students who are low-income and first generation. Thus, also decreasingenrichment in diversity and inclusiveness that these UC’s claim. Higher education is a right andeveryone should have access no matter their financial background. In 2013, studentscontributed 3 Billion dollars versus the state which only pays 2.38 billion. More money into oureducation rather than prison complexes! Tuition was free for many years and can be again.Free higher education is greater for the collective public good..","The mental health services at UCSB can be improved in so many different ways. Diversity withinmental health services needs to be emphasized in future hirings. Diversity is so important withmental health educators and therapists, to better serve the marginalized students on ourcampus. Putting more money into these services can alleviate the limitations that our currentmental health services face. This includes both wait times and communication. Mental health isa real issue that UCSB students have and go through, so looking into CAPS turning into morethan a one time stop is really what administration should look into. We need more actual helpfrom these students rather than a one time stop and then looking away. Students have mentalhealth issues that are invisible and that are diminishing their academic performances. Havingmental health town halls such as last quarter every quarter can be so vital to improvement andworking with the Public Mental Health Commission org here on campus.","In response with fear, strength, and determination, others and I co-led the demonstration
against sexual assault that ended with student-wide solidarity for survivors. School-wide
solidarity was amazing, because we were out there in the arbor talking to these students and
listening to their immediate concerns. We passed out blue ribbons knowing people can see this
solidarity anywhere on campus if they did not feel comfortable showing to the arbor. The efforts
that happened this day showed that students are always the front liners to address situations
that happen around campus to other students.
Emails were sent after this demonstration in an act of trying to mend what was already done.
Currently, there is strong miscommunications happening between the student body and
administration within these topics. Language about sexual violence and survivor solidarity is
extremely important. Administration responded with countless emails and students had many
concerns because of those emails. The situation escalated as well as the lack of public
response by these fraternities that should have acted in response to survivors. Violence within
UCSB is still continuous, even if it is silent. There are still a lot of improvements that should and
will be done within our community. As an off-campus senator, the liaison between administration
and student body concerns will hopefully become a priority. Administration should be able to
listen to these students' concerns and address them in better ways than sending emails that
may be miscommunicated. That is also a two-way street, so we shall see what can be done!","Although I see why Title IX can be beneficial to campuses and can ensure more equality, thereare still a lot of improvements that can be made within the title ix offices to ensure more safetyaway with mandated reporters. Some students allegedly do not even know who are mandatedreporters on our campus at this point. Taking away the consent of survivors who endureviolence and to immediately tell Title IX of the report is so degrading to a survivor. Taking awaythe act of control of who is told and who is not puts the survivor after the predator of thesituation. Another critique that lots of students bring up, is the issue that Title IX offices are sucha gruesome process that ends up not listening to what the survivors actually need in thesituation. Some cases do not even follow through. Power dynamics are not questioned and areignored. This can be seen in sexual assault cases against professors that end up not beingterminated, rather shown an sexual assault prevention training.for our students' well-being. One critique that I have of Title IX is the act of taking one's consent","Not at the moment. In looking at diversity within the student population, faculty and staff, and
even mental health staff within CAPS and CARE, UCSB has efficiently disregarded diversity
and inclusivity. Other than diversity, demands within BSU organizations have been made to
UCSB with no avail. For decades now, there have been certain demands that ensure students'
success within UCSB that has been ignored, belittled, and looked past. Professors also seem
to have leniency within their academic curriculum which means that the readings that are being
assigned are not from diverse groups which also underrepresents the students diversity as well.
Students within these underrepresented groups are put last and rejected to even take up space
within campus physically and mentally. The very alarming fact is that we still have a european
requirement in all of our academic careers. That should be the first decolonization act that must
be taken at UCSB.","A bill introducing the use of CalFresh on campus vendor locations such as the Corner Store,
Coral Tree Cafe, etc. I believe it is important to use CalFresh in order to increase the usage
anywhere on campus rather than only in the Arbor! Students who rely on Calfresh should be
able to purchase food at other vendors on campus.","Being involved in the student body means interacting with students that you normally wouldn’tcross paths with. This means proactively trying to meet new people, learn about theirexperiences, and listen to their voices. Not only to listen to their voices, but to take action withinour community. This can be done within social media platforms, that I plan to keep public suchas facebook pages. This means keeping an open forum open to all and anonymous complaintsor improvement advice. Another way that I plan to keep my senator position open to all, isattend different organization meetings. It is the best way to connect in our community to meetdifferent people as well as learn the different passions that our UCSB community has. As asenator, I only want to alleviate those voices that are often ignored​","The biggest priorities that I have for the next UC President is one that believes inintersectionality! One that recognizes that we are occupying Chumash lands. One that believesin indigenous rights. One that believes in higher wages for grad students and wants to enactCOLA. One that knows that mandated reporting is not the safest way for survivors. One thatunderstands the need for diversity and inclusiveness in our higher education. One that believesthat any racist, transphobic, ableist, homophobic, elistist acts will have immediateconsequences and is not tolerable. One that wants to decrease tuition and make it free. Onethat does NOT WANT TO TAKE PART IN THE TMT ON MAUNA KEA! One that believes inlabor rights within the UC industry. One that acknowledges all the mistakes made within our UCsystem. One that believes in destigmatizing mental health in higher education for allpopulations. One that puts students over profit.",,,,,,,
Rosey Lavery,sanya,L&S Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roseylavery.jpeg,,"She, her, hers",3rd,Communication,,,"I am currently running to be a senator with the 71st senate at UCSB because I have seen the dedication and passion that goes into these positions, and I want to bring the same qualities to this organization. I was lucky to be educated and involved with political movements from a young age thanks to my Dad. His job has required him to be very involved in local politics, and that led to my sister and I tagging along. Our involvement ranged anywhere from attending city hall meetings in San Francisco to being campaign volunteers for individuals such as current California Governor Gavin Newsom. It was because of this experience back home that I was excited to become involved in our own campus politics. 
Being a current Junior at our school, I have had the time and experience to become very familiar and immersed within both our campus and Isla Vista communities. UCSB has given me the chance to appreciate the great opportunities given here, but also experience aspects and services that need to be improved or implemented. As a senator, I want to be an advocate for the change and concerns students of all class standings, backgrounds, and identities want brought to the attention of the Senate. ","I have been involved with both my sorority and the Isla Vista Party during my time here at UCSB. My sophomore year, I learned about our school’s senate when a few of my friends chose to run for positions. After they told me about their platforms and all the teamwork that goes into campaigning, I knew that I wanted to be involved in some way. 
I volunteered to help them campaign in the time leading up to and during elections. From handing out fliers at the Arbor to reposting information on social media, I was there to support my friends and their goals through the entire process. Since their election, I have seen first hand all the hard work they put into their positions on and off the clock. After talking to my peers about their workload and ability to balance school work and senate, I am confident that I will thrive in this position. 
I know that I will be able to handle the workload and duties that come with being a senator because my previous experience has prepared me for it. Over the past year, I served as my sorority’s Recruitment and Marketing Vice President which taught me how to be a leader amongst my peers. My duties included multiple weekly and monthly meetings with advisors, chapter members, and the rest of our executive board. Our positions gave us the platform to make much needed change within our own organization, and I made sure to make as many changes as I could during my term. I want to bring that same mindset with me to the 71st Senate if elected. ","Considering the recent changes to our curriculum, there is going to be a lot of necessary work done by the 71st senate. If elected, my first resolution would be to ensure that all of the UCSB employees who were laid off or displaced by the Corona Virus have their jobs waiting for them once our campus reopens. The unemployment rate in our country has skyrocketed to numbers beyond that of the Great Depression in just a matter of weeks. The only way for the University to make a contribution to lowering these numbers would be to rehire their employees. From janitorial staff to campus restaurant staff, much of the non-essential employees during the lockdown have nowhere to work, but as soon as we return to what will be the new normal, there should be nothing stopping these organizations from rehiring the same individuals if they chose to return. 
My second resolution would be to stop the University from drastically increasing student fees to help finance COVID-19 related expenses and advocate for an increase in financial aid resources. The probability that the University could become financially displaced by the current pandemic is high, but the likelihood of students being financially displaced is much higher. As we continue into the future, it is our job to support the members of our community. Therefore it is the duty of the school to ensure that students affected by COVID-10 have access to financial aid resources to help them continue their education. 
My third resolution would be to finance a grant program specifically for situations such as the one COVID-19 has put us in. In order to take future precautions to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19 or any other contagions within our community, we should be providing the tools to do so and ensuring that we are prepared to fix the damage done. ","My platform has its foundation in my vision of expanding campus resources to better suit the current needs of our UCSB community. I would like to take steps to do this by collaborating with CLAS to expand one-on-one tutoring to Davidson Library and the University Center. Establishing workshops offered multiple times a year through each department in the College of Letters and Science to teach students specialized skills in their career fields is another vision that I am passionate about. Additionally, I want to implement a healthy habits movement with the help of CAPS during finals week each quarter. 
In order to keep this momentum consistent, I plan on constantly making small attainable goals that will help set the stage to achieve my long term goals. Making all of these visions a reality is going to take a lot of time and effort, but it is time and effort that I am willing to give. These aspects of my platform are just a few of the many resources on campus that are not reaching their fullest potential to meet the needs of the students on our campus. Students are struggling to teach themselves course materials, worried they don’t have what it takes to succeed in a career post graduation, and developing unhealthy study habits just to get through it all. Our university needs to hear these issues and do something to fix them, and I want to be one of the many people who will tell them that. 
","As mentioned above, I want to work with organizations such as CLAS, CAPS, and departments within the College of Letters and Science. Additionally, I want to also work with Associated Students to raise student awareness of the many resources they offer including the Food Bank and Book Bank. Each aspect of my platform requires me to meet and collaborate with leaders within each of these campus organizations. I thoroughly enjoy working on projects I am passionate about, and having the opportunity to meet with individuals who can aid me during the process is help that I am willing to take. ","During this stressful time, I know that every student has questions about how they will continue their education as we adapt to our continuously changing curriculum. From inconsistent communication between professors and students, varying lecture formats, waitlisting and crashing courses, our education is all over the place right now. If elected, my hope is to create some sort of consistency for students amidst all of this mess. 
I want to make myself available to students starting in the summer so that come Fall, senators will already have a list of needs from members of our community that we can start resolving. Whether it be over Zoom or through email, I want to have conversations with students about how we can meet individual needs and unique situations from home. By doing this, my hope is that I will be able to bring these concerns to department heads within the College of Letters and Science and work towards implementing solutions come Fall Quarter. ","I am the best candidate for the College of Letters and Science Senator because I have both the skills and the mindset needed to be successful in this position. My whole life I have been taught to be a hard worker, a problem solver, and a go-getter. These qualities have become a part of who I am, and I have utilized them to do good in any way I can. 
Whether it be playing on my lacrosse team in high school, participating in clubs, taking on a leadership position, or volunteering with local non-profits, I have always been involved in my community in various ways. Being involved in many organizations has taught me how to network, speak up for, and collaborate with members of my community. I know for a fact that these skills make me fit for the responsibilities that come with being a College of Letters and Science Senator, and I plan on utilizing them if elected to this position.",Left-leaning ,"Very good; The 2019-2020 school year has presented the 70th A.S. Senate with a variety of challenges and I believe they lived up to their duties as best as they could. The passing of resolutions to defeat the stigma surrounding mental health, to make UCSB a sanctuary campus, and to support the impeachment of Donald Trump are just a few of the resolutions passed that I stand with.  ",I am not fully educated enough on the situation taking place in Israel & Palestine to make an adequate vote on this matter at the time. The fact that this is such a serious decision requires one to be aware of the positives and the negatives of choosing to divest or not to. I plan to look further into the matter to do just that.,"Yes; While it would be much less of a financial burden on students for UCSB to be a tuition-free institution, our tuition is what funds many of the events thrown on campus and pays the salaries of our staff. Until the day comes that UCSB is tuition free, students must continue to pay tuition in order for the university to continue functioning the way it does, In order to support the students who at this time cannot afford our tuition, we must ensure that we raise awareness and continue to provide the financial aid and support that our university provides.","While I do believe there are adequate resources for mental health services, what is lacking is the access to these services. Students who are in need of urgent mental health services often find themselves unable to see a professional until 2-4 weeks later. We must first address the problem by hiring more staff at CAPS in order to open more appointment times for students. In addition, CAPS should begin hosting workshops on mental health education so that students are more aware of the signs that they might need professional help.  ","In a situation such as this, it’s the University’s responsibility to ensure all accusations are heard and investigated with all seriousness. As a woman at UCSB and a member of Greek life on campus, I can speak for many of my peers when I say it is our right to be informed of sexual assault accusations made within our community. At the same time, I do not need to know every detail within the case because we also want to make sure we are centering survivors. While the university should make students aware of where and when the event took place and investigate all accusations to the fullest extent, the majority of information should be limited to those involved. The steps taken by IFC and Panhellenic in response to these reports has shown that our community has not taken this situation lightly, but further steps must be taken by the University to put an end to sexual assault once and for all. 
","There are many pros and cons when it comes to addressing how adequate Title IX is to address sexual assault on campus.  When it was written into law, Title IX opened the door for women to equally participate in the workplace and at educational institutes. But since its implementation, various forms of sexual assault and harrassment still occur within these institutions, and are often brushed off. It is my personal opinion that when it comes to addressing accusations, Title IX leaves University staff too much leeway when it comes to interpreting what is to be defined as sexual assault. A better line of communication must be established between law enforcement and Universities in order for things to improve. ","I myself am not a member of a historically underrepresented group, so I am not the person to determine if our university is effectively serving them. Using my position as an L&S senator, I want to hear first hand from groups within the Multicultural Center and organizations serving our LGBTQ community how our university can better serve them.  ","If elected to serve on the Senate, my first resolution would be to expand CLAS to have one-on-one tutoring sign ups at both the University Center and Davidson Library. This has the potential to aid many students in their studies as a great majority frequently utilize these campus buildings for studying purposes. By expanding CLAS beyond the Student Resource Building, more appointment times will become available to students as a result. ","As a member of A.S., I plan on making myself accessible to the average student by utilizing social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to repost and update the student body on Senate activities. While most of our student body is currently on our platforms, there are many that still aren’t. I believe that the creation of a weekly or monthly Senate newsletter to be sent to student’s UCSB emails would be a creative way to make sure that every student has the tools to keep themselves updated on bills, resolutions, and senate activities. ","I see the top priority for the newly hired UC President being the efforts that need to be taken in order to recover from the damage COVID-19 has done to our community. Many university staff and laborers have been put out of work or laid off due to the UC campus closures. Once the campuses reopen and we transition back to in-person classes, the new UC President should work to ensure that all staff who were displaced by the campus closures have the opportunity to return to their jobs.

Jose Gonzalez Herrera,sanya,L&S Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jose-Gonzalez-Herrera.jpeg,, he/they,3rd ,Sociology major with a minor in Applied Psychology,,,"I considered running for A.S. Senate my first year, back in 2018. I wanted to see positive change happen on campus. Change that would help students achieve their personal ambitions, while advocating for social justice. However, at the time, I did not feel ready to nor did I really understand the different issues students face in college. I took it upon myself to dedicate the next two years of my time here at UCSB to invest myself in organizations and issues that I felt the most passionate about. Along this personal journey, I grew to understand how interconnected everything is. I learned about the community, about real world experiences that have shaped my peers throughout their lives, and about my own experiences and the learning I’ve done. Now, I feel a great restlessness and hurt for the injustices we have all faced in varying degrees at different points in our lives. I’m running to be a College of Letters & Science senator with the 71st senate because I believe I am ready enough to create the change I wish to see at UCSB, and in a greater sense, the world. I’m running because students' voices deserve to be heard, and I want to help them have their voices heard. I want students to have the power and force to change what they see as unfit, and demand what they are owed.","As a first year, I immersed myself in the LGBTQ+ community here on campus by participating in the social life and involving myself in organizations like the Queer Student Union, as their Freshman Liaison and then as their Vice Chair. During my second year, I was involved with A.S. Queer Commission as 1 of the 2 UCSB Pride Co-Chairs, and as a new member of my fraternity, Theta Nu Kappa Multicultural and Academic Fraternity, Inc. Within my fraternity, I have been a part of our recruitment team, one of our Philanthropy Co-Chairs, and now as the President for the 2020-2021 academic year. However, these positions and titles alone don’t prepare me to be a senator. It’s the hard work and perseverance through personal challenges that is what has prepared me. These positions and titles have served as a platform for learning and growth, and have given me many opportunities for personal development, while my education has expanded my worldview. Within the queer community, I have learned to be comfortable with my identity and expression. I’ve grown super comfortable with myself and feel confident enough to never hide who I am. Joining my fraternity has given me a home away from home, and certainty to uncertainty. As a growing adult, I am beginning to understand what I need to do to take care of myself, so that I can better look out for others. In the future, I hope to become a counselor or therapist because what I love the most is helping others. That’s why I feel prepared to be a senator.","I’d like to introduce a resolution/bill supporting and advocating for a reformation of academic advising. Students in the College of Letters & Science are often told that changing their major or taking alternative classes is easier to do than following the path they had originally planned out. They often change majors because of the lack of support. This resolution/bill would include an easier, more transparent method of building a 4-year plan, or a plan for however many years a student plans to attend UCSB. This may include a revamped or new website, where students can build their schedule and be able to check prerequisites and requirements all in one place, as well as chat with an online advisor. Secondly, I’d like to introduce a resolution demanding transparency from OSL in the handling of incidents of interpersonal violence within Greek Life. It’s incredibly important that the UCSB community knows what goes on between the university and Greek Life, so they can have a greater say in the actions that must be taken, jointly with leaders of Greek organizations. Thirdly, I would introduce a bill giving more funding for BCUs. Being able to operate and fund organizations on campus that need them in order to provide the education and resources is essential to student life.","My platform focuses on the issues that I want to see worked on. These include interpersonal violence, student wages, and academic advising. For the first issue, I will be working with Alia Reynolds and Students Against Sexual Assault, in order to implement their “Healthy Masculinities Curriculum” they have created in collaboration with Dr. Victor Rios that is based on his upcoming book on toxic masculinity. Their curriculum focuses on training a selected group of men from IFC fraternities who have expressed interest and have the ability to train their fraternity member peers. I will be helping them by facilitating the expansion of the training to USFC entities (United Sorority and Fraternity Council). For the second issue, I will be hearing the concerns and challenges of students and UC Workers in order to better support them and advocate for them. Workers are not being paid enough to live and survive, and the high costs of living in Isla Vista and Santa Barbara make it incredibly difficult to prioritize their well-being. The third part of my platform that I will work to achieve is college advising. I will be meeting with the College of Letters & Science to discuss ways to better listen to students in order to provide flexibility and better management of student needs, and conducting a survey to find out
which needs need to be fulfilled most for students.","Previously mentioned, I will be working with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) to implement their “Healthy Masculinities Curriculum.” They have been developing this curriculum for the IFC council, and I will be helping them adapt it for multicultural Greek Life. Their current curriculum is based off of Dr. Victor Rios’s upcoming book that deconstructs how toxic/hegemonic masculinity is created and how it can be replaced with healthy masculinity. The training content will be administered to male members of Greek Life and be tested to ensure the training is being absorbed. I will also be working with the College of Letters & Science to advocate for the needs of students. I will be taking advice, comments, criticism, etc. of students in my college and the other colleges to better represent them. Additionally, I hope to work with A.S., the university, and the broader UCSB community in order to help increase working wages and resources available to students that both work, and don’t work, with the UC.","I use a lot of remote forms of communication like social media, email, and phone number. I will try to make myself as accessible as possible to anyone who needs to get in communication with me or who needs my advice. I enjoy helping others, and if I can make things easier for my constituents, then I see no problem in being able to manage and accommodate for a possible shift to online classes through summer and fall quarter. More concrete examples include creating a facebook page where students may get in contact with me, along with plugging other forms of communication on that page and other media platforms.","I have a unique experience and relationship with UCSB. Not only have I been actively involved on campus, but I have shared my leadership, my friendship, and my knowledge with my peers. My identity as a queer, low-income, first-generation, latino student has greatly shaped my college experience and will continue to do so even after college. This institution wasn’t designed for people like me. Yet, I preserved through mental health challenges, homelessness, and being away from my family, which gives me comfort and safety. Being told that I should have dropped out by now by university employees hasn’t stopped me from doing the most I could possibly do for others. I’m the best candidate for this position because I’ve had to fight to be here. I have the experience, the passion, the ambition, the listening skills, and the fire that is required.",Left-leaning,"Very Good; I would give the 70th A.S. Senate a rating of “very good,” because I believe they have acted appropriately and in the best interest of students when addressing the issue of sexual violence earlier this year, supporting AFSCME Local 3299’s union strike, and supporting graduate students COLA wildcat strike.","Yes; To be an ally means you have one foot in and one foot out. To be an advocate means you have both feet in. I’m a humanitarian, and I stand against human rights violations, which includes divesting from companies that profit from them in Israel.","Yes; Education is a right. Cost of tuition should not be a reason for why students decide not to attend.
It should also not be a burden for those going through financial crises. Many students here at
UCSB experience anxiety over being able to afford books, clothes, tools, and the university
should not be demanding tuition or risk a student being dropped from classes.","I consistently use CAPS and DSP services here at the university. My experience with my current therapist has been extremely positive, and I have been able to overcome so much with them. They have helped me apply to DSP and set up an appointment with a psychiatrist at Student Health so that I could receive medication. I’m super happy with where I am. However, my experience using mental health services at UCSB hasn't always been positive. My first year, my family went through homelessness (and are still currently homeless). My mental health wasn’t the best, and it was difficult to reach out to my family without it negatively affecting me. When I went to CAPS, I had to wait about 2 weeks to talk to someone. I came to the conclusion that I had to face this hardship on my own. CAPS and CARE need more funding. They need a larger building, with more resources and staff. The university must be able to support their students through challenges that don’t directly come from academics.","Yes, the university could’ve definitely handled this better. It should not have taken multiple reports of sexual assault for them to take action. The university should’ve worked with the IFC and USFC fraternities earlier and enforced stricter policies and guidelines. Many students were left without information, resources, and education, and survivors were left feeling unheard and unsupported. Even if the police department was conducting an investigation, there was a lot they could’ve done in the meantime, like calling an immediate meeting with all leaders of Greek Life and doing a complete review of their individual risk management policies.","No. Title IX does not immediately respond to the needs of survivors. Sexual assault interferes with every aspect of a person’s life, and immediate action needs to be taken in order to ensure the well-being of survivors. There needs to be financial relief and justice.","No. There were demands to create a free standing resource center for LGBTQ+ students in Fall 2017, but very little progress has been made on that. The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity is currently located in a small room on the third floor of the Student Resource Building. There also is no mandatory training for incoming students that go into further depth on the experiences and complexities of belonging to historically underrepresented groups.","I plan to author a bill requiring complete transparency and immediate resolution from the university, Office of Student Life, Greek Life, and the UCSB community to better support survivors of sexual assault and interpersonal violence. I want to tackle this issue head on, because this affects not just this community, but everyone around the world. This will promote community safety in Isla Vista by ensuring that students are able to report with confidence that the proper steps will be taken and they will be heard. This will also promote community safety by requiring leaders of Greek Life to hold a greater discussion on how we can better protect all communities. We must set a precedent for people to follow and create tangible change that can be looked upon on a national scale. The work that A.S. Senate does not just stay here at UCSB.","I believe canvassing and discussing with different communities on campus needs to be done, which includes the residents halls and in Isla Vista. It is our job to make sure that changes happening within the UC are relayed to our constituents so that they can stay informed and be able to participate in A.S. It is important that we bridge the gap between A.S. and students to make ourselves more accessible. It’s impossible to represent your constituents when you don’t put in the work to get to know them, hear them, and understand them. Most of the student population gets their information from student run news accounts. Administration needs to do the same as well. The people who control UC don’t communicate with students effectively, nor do they listen to those they claim to support and represent. That must be changed.","Someone who supports a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for graduate students & someone who is willing to provide medical supplies to hospitals during crises. Janet Napolitano has failed to be a humanitarian and has proved that she does not care about students. The UC continues to profit off of the work of its students and not reward them for their work. The classes TAs teach is labor they do in order to educate those who give the UC universities their rankings. We as students and UC workers need someone who is supported by us and will listen to us. During this COVID-19 pandemic, she has disallowed UC workers from supplying hospitals with the proper medical supplies that we need in order to survive. This is a global pandemic, and billions of people are at risk.",,,,,,,
Ava Kargosha,sanya,L&S Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ava-Kargosha-rotated.jpeg,,She/her/hers,3rd,Psychological & Brain Sciences and Political Science,,,"I am running to be the Letters and Science senator because I want to create change that better addresses the needs of students. I aspire to instill the values of diversity and equal opportunity in order to make sure that every student feels welcomed and heard on campus. As a part of the middle eastern community on campus, I understand the importance of representation and visibility for minority communities. During my three years here at UCSB, I have noticed many difficulties my peers and myself have faced in the Department of Letters and Sciences. As a Psychological and Brain Sciences major as well as a Political Science major, there have been many times where I’ve logged on during my pass time only to find all of the classes full, been terrified of being cut from an impacted major, and been told by advisors to just switch to a less popular major. I know these struggles are unfortunately not unique to me, and so I am running to improve these conditions so that this added stress is eliminated. If UCSB insists on over enrolling students, then we must insist on putting that money towards creating more classes and hiring more professors to meet the needs of each major.","Being a Resident Assistant in Manzanita last year has definitely prepared me to be a senator as it has taught me how to handle immense responsibility. I was trained for and responded to emergency situations, handled drug and alcohol situations, and counseled residents with mental health concerns and roommate conflicts. The job also taught me how to properly manage my time and be able to work more productively. In addition, the position allowed me to strengthen both my leadership and teamwork skills. I worked independently as well as with fellow RA’s and campus organizations, to plan and host programs for residents. My interpersonal and speech skills also improved greatly as I often held house meetings and had one on one meetings with my residents. Chatting regularly to my 70+ residents allowed me to hear the concerns of students and how each of them struggled to navigate the campus and find resources. These are important skills and experiences as a senator, because knowing what your constituents struggle with and how to connect with students are necessary to create impactful legislation. As a senator, demonstrating responsibility and efficiency in the position is crucial in order to be a competent representative. In addition, I am a member of UCSB Lobby Corp and my experiences in this organization have shown me the power that a single person can have. This has prepared me to be a senator as I have fought for better student conditions as well as learned how to read and analyze legislation. Furthermore, in my first year I was in the Hall Council in Santa Catalina South as the Multicultural Awareness Chair. In this position I participated in biweekly social justice trainings where I learned about the importance of diversity, identity, and equal opportunity, and how to advocate for it effectively. Off of those trainings, I created and hosted events centered on the social justice topics and was able to teach and connect with my peers with honest discussions. This position showed me the importance of representation and visibility of communities, which I believe is important for an AS senator to understand and believe as they are representing so many of those communities. The most important thing I learned from that position, however, is how necessary honest and open discussion is. Everyone deserves the chance to be listened to, and no progress or learning can come from shutting down someone’s voice.","As a Letters and Science Senator, I plan to author a bill to modify and improve GOLD so that students can more easily sign up for classes using a shopping cart system. In this method, students can load up all of the classes they would like to sign up for in a “shopping cart” page before their pass time. This would make it so that once the pass time starts, all the student must do is click “add classes”. There will be an option to have backup classes ready to go if one of the classes is full when you try to add. This decreases the high stress that students face trying to quickly click through all the classes and add them one by one. The next bill I will author if elected is the enhancement of the Swipe Out Hunger program that exists in collaboration with the Food Bank. Enhancing this program and better incentivizing students to donate unused meal swipes would provide meals to students in need. I am very passionate about this project as Food Insecurity is a large issue on our campus. Meal Swipes often go unused especially when students go home for a weekend, and so this bill would allocate more resources to the Swipe Out Hunger Program to make it a larger movement on campus. For example, a point system can be implemented so that students who donate meal swipes get points that can translate to rewards such as free UCSB merchandise or tickets to campus events. Another bill I plan to introduce is the creation of a mentorship program between students and alumni in order to help students navigate career paths and network in their field. Every student is at UCSB in order to get started on their career path, however I don’t believe the school provides enough resources to help us be successful in our fields and interact with professionals. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to create a bill that sponsors a program that pairs up students with faculty and alumni in order to mentor students and help them achieve their goals. This program would allow students to gain advice from professionals in their desired field and learn what day to day tasks would look like for them in that career, specifically from people who were UCSB students just like them. My vision is to collaborate with the Career Center as well as with department heads and the alumni network in order to start this project.","My platform is based around making UCSB and its resources more accessible, and easier to navigate. My platform involves; modifying GOLD so that students can more easily sign up for classes, increasing availability and affordability of textbooks, expanding CLAS to accommodate all majors and learning methods, enhancing the Swipe Out Hunger Program to further decrease student food insecurity, create an AS School Supply Bank, and the implementation of a career mentorship and networking program for students and alumni. I will achieve these goals while in office through working with all members of the senate regardless of party associations. We are all students who want the best for students like ourselves, and so I don’t anticipate many pushback against wanting students to be able to afford food and textbooks. I intend to collaborate with both On Campus and Off Campus senators to execute the expansion of the Swipe Out Hunger program, so that students with meal swipes are incentivized to donate extra swipes to off campus students in need. For the plans to make course registration on GOLD much easier and to make a mentorship alumni program, I plan to collaborate with all of the other collegiate senators so that our collective force can have a large impact on the administration. Overall, I intend to make sure I do everything in my power to pass these bills, such as by reaching out to campus organizations with similar goals, and by consistently pushing the UCSB administration to put student needs first.","Firstly, I hope to work with faculty and administration to change the course selecting system on GOLD to make it easier and more user friendly, as well as expanding course reserves and digital rental options. I then plan to work with department heads in Letters and Sciences to work on creating new majors and minors to better fit the needs of students. I also hope to work with the department heads on creating pages for each major so that students can form study groups. In addition, I plan to work with CLAS and CAPS in order to bolster both of the programs in order to be equipped to serve a larger population of students. I also plan on working with the Swipe Out Hunger organization and the Food Bank in order to better incentivize and advertise meal swipe donations. Furthermore, I plan on working with the Career Center to create the alumni mentorship program in order to help students successfully transition into their careers after they graduate.",I will make myself available to my constituents through zoom office hours as well as through my facebook page where they can message me questions and concerns. I will make sure to remain available to constituents no matter the status of the campus itself.,"I am the best candidate for this position because I am experienced in working with students and staff as described in my previous positions as a Resident Assistant and a Multicultural Awareness Chair. I also served as Vice President of Persian Student Group, which allowed me to work with the Student Resource Building, EOP, and other cultural organizations. In those collaborations, I got a glimpse at how diverse and rich our many communities are at UCSB, but also how hidden many of the resources can be and how we can make our organizations even better. In addition, I am a double major within the Letters and Science Department, one being a BS degree and the other a BA degree, and so I understand the needs and concerns of students in either side of the department. I will ensure that my Senate legislation will benefit everyone because I am hard working, determined, and incredibly passionate to represent and hear from the students I aim to serve. I am the best candidate because I consistently strive to improve the condition of UCSB students, whether it be by lobbying for student mental healthcare in Sacramento or working with housing staff to improve university housing.",Left-leaning,"Very Good; There have been several pieces of legislation this year that I have been very pleased with such as Daniel Segura’s and Racquel Almario’s resolution calling out the UC system for its unfair labor practices, and Adalis Rojas and Ektaa Tendolkar’s resolution to reissue UCSB as a sanctuary campus. However, I hope to see more legislation focused on fixing the never ending wait times at CAPS, and on helping students academically in terms of expanding CLAS and with smoother course registration.","I do not believe I am educated enough on this topic to make a decisive decision. I am always in support of human rights, however this issue is not black and white. Both sides have very valid arguments for and against divestment and I look forward to hearing the concerns of my constituents on this topic.","Yes; Yes, because I believe education is a right and must be a nation’s priority. Public universities should be accessible to the general public, and the proposed solution of raising taxes by $48 per household would achieve this goal of free higher education for all. However, as this goal is not likely to be achieved for a while, my goal as a senator would be to seek out ways to expand scholarships and grants for students.","No, I don’t believe the mental health services at UCSB are adequate. CAPS is a great resource however it lacks a lot of infrastructure to keep it running smoothly. There are not enough hired professionals on staff that are trained for the diverse array of students and mental health issues we face. The process of getting an appointment can be very disheartening and nearly impossible. Getting a hold of a psychiatrist at Student Health is even less of a possibility as they are booked for the entire quarter by the second day of the quarter. Telling students to wait until next quarter to receive mental health treatment is not an option. The mental health services need to be bolstered, because UCSB students are paying a lot of money for these services that they are never actually able to utilize. There needs to be a redistribution of funds, making CAPS and Student Health a priority. I propose that CAPS staff be accessible in all of the resident halls and in Pardall Center, in addition to their place in the CAPS building. CAPS should also allow appointments to be made online, as many students may not be physically or mentally capable of making the appointment in person.","Although I was studying abroad during fall quarter and not on campus during that time, I remained updated on the situation through school emails and Daily Nexus articles. I do believe the university could have handled the situation better by responding more quickly to the reports and being much more clear about the steps that were being taken to investigate the situation. Even though I understand that under TItle IX the anonymity of the alleged assailant is needed to protect the anonymity of the victim by proxy, the university had a responsibility to inform the school of the fraternity involved, as it was their third sexual assault allegation that month alone. It remains eerily unclear what happened to the investigation and whether the alleged assailant had endured any consequences by the university. This is unsettling as the student body deserves to know the outcome of this investigation. I commend the fraternity for expelling the member from the fraternity, and I believe the organization did the best they could in the aftermath of that situation. However, I believe that Greek Life and the university need to focus more intently on education and sexual assault prevention to ensure that situations like these do not occur. If elected senator, I intend on implementing such a program.","Title IX has helped many students who have been involved in sexual assault, and is a great resource however the main problem with Title IX is that it does not take sexual violence as seriously as the justice system does. The Title IX punishment is usually year-long suspension, as the investigation process and punishment is entirely up to the schools’ discretion. Therefore, it is only an adequate system if the university chooses to make it so. There are countless stories of victims who have to continue to attend school with their attacker even after being found guilty. Therefore, there are several changes that can be made to make Title IX work for its students. If expulsion is the consequence of academic dishonesty at most schools, sexual assault should be too. In addition, survivors of sexual assault need to be sufficiently supported by their school in terms of
mental health and comfortability to report. The law should be revised to require universities to create a safe environment for plaintiffs, even if the accused is not found guilty. For example, the school to make sure the two parties are not in the same classes, do not have to live in the same building, and so on. This would provide the plaintiff an extra sense of security and comfort, in the cases where a guilty attacker was wrongfully found innocent. It has been almost half a century since Title IX was signed into federal law, and it is time the law becomes updated.","Although UCSB admits an even more diverse group of students each year than the last, I do not believe that UCSB is serving historically underrepresented groups as effectively as they can be. For example, the university has not put in enough effort to communicate with members of BSU and the black community. BSU members have been consistently advocating for themselves and their community, and UCSB has not been actively working on providing for their well deserved needs. In addition, while it is wonderful that UCSB is a hispanic serving institution, the school does not provide effective resources for those students after they are admitted. More can be done to retain retention rates for latinx students, such as with a diversification of EOP to allow for more specialized counselors and mentors to meet individual needs. Also, the RCSGD is a great resource center, however I believe there are many other departments that can be doing more to destigmatize and discuss the mental health issues the LGBTQ+ community faces. Fortunately, I believe that AS does a great job of representing the different communities at UCSB. Minority communities contribute a lot to the success of UCSB, and investing in students will always pay off.","When elected to the Senate, the first bill I plan to author is the expansion of CAPS in order to shorten wait times and provide weekend services. CAPS does not currently have a staff that is able to handle our student population. Therefore, I would like to reallocate more funds into CAPS, without raising tuition, in order to make sure that students are not left waiting months in order to receive the mental health treatments that they are paying the school for. This would involve more hired professionals, an online appointment center, bolstered weekend services, and a more diverse team to be able to provide for the varied needs of students. The mental health crisis is very real, and it is horrifying that the second leading cause of death for young people is suicide. Our campus is no stranger to these tragedies, and it is far overdue for some real change to happen. It is shameful that the services we are paying for are often out of reach and unavailable. The university needs to put students first, and CAPS needs to become a realistic resource. As an RA last year for Manzanita Village, I would often recommend CAPS as a resource, and I would dread having to hear back from my resident about how they were turned away and told to try again to get an appointment in a few weeks. Over enrollment worsens the already minimal amount of service that CAPS is able to give, therefore the university must expand CAPS and other services if it continues to expand the student population.","This is my first year joining the A.S. network, and being a third year, I definitely felt that AS was inaccessible to me. I didn’t even know we had a senate or a legislative
body until my second year, and even then was unaware of the work they did. The AS system comes off as very ambiguous and out of reach. I personally felt intimidated by it and did not know how to get involved for the longest time. I did not feel like I was the AS “type”, however since joining the Isla Vista Party and getting to know more people who are involved in AS, I have realized the great thing about AS is that there is no “type”. The best part about this organization is that its purpose is to gather students from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and have them work as a team to better the UCSB experience. And so if we want to truly represent the student body, they must be aware we are representing them at all. Therefore, I propose that senate meetings be broadcasted online, and be available for the student body to view. In addition, legislation that is in the process of being voted on, or has been either passed or failed to pass must be made public and accessible as well. I propose that biweekly emails be sent out to the student body with links to all of this material, so that they can view and comment on what their representatives are working on. In addition, AS and the inner workings of student legislation must be discussed during Transfer Student and First Year Student orientations. This would allow students from all experiences to have a chance to get involved.","The top priority for the next UC president will be to finally have a dialogue with the striking grad students, and discuss the COLA movement which President Napolitano and her staff repeatedly refused to do. In line with this, the issues of food insecurity and homelessness for both undergraduate and graduate students need to be a priority for the UC system if they want to keep its high retention rates. Basic needs must be met for students to be able to be successful. No one can perform well on a test if they are stressing about where their next meal will come from. Better access to resources and more grants must be given to make sure that no student falls through the cracks. Next, reviewing and fixing the flaws in the CAPS system must be a priority. This is an especially pressing issue with the increased need for mental health support after the closure of UC campuses during the spring quarter. The effects of social distancing and being away from UC support systems will be long lasting. The UC system is a wealthy one, and it's time for the students to be treated as an investment instead of as a piggy bank.",,,,,,,

Oftentimes there are so many things I or my fellow peers want to change and systems and rules we find unfair and detrimental to academic success. Sadly the only thing we do is complain or vent on twitter. I decided that I want to help make the changes my fellow peers and I want to see rather than remain a bystander. ,"Since I'm a 4th year I have an abundance of UCSB experience. Being a student with everything that comes with it such as housing, financial aid, administration, petitions etc. I would love to share and help others with the experience and knowledge I have gained during my time being a gaucho.","Ever struggled with a “weeder” class that made you struggle more than the upper-division class?! Well, I want to SURVEY and IMPLEMENT a process where Deans, Professors, and Departments approach a comprehensive approach to gauge students' understanding of a course rather than “weed” them out of majors! More than 30% of students should not be retaking a course to get into a major

I will listen to my fellow gauchos and collaborate with UCSB administration, college deans , professors and instructors to make change.","I plan to work with UCSB administration, Department heads, Professors,TAs and students directly. Collaboration and participation by everyone involved is needed to make comprehensive change.","I am available always through email, social media and zoom calls.

In addition so many umbrella organizations and amendments for made to create needed spaces for students
","Yes; Absolutely. Education institutions should be for education and JUST that, educational institutions. Having monetary investments in controversial matters or anything unrelated to the campus should not occur. Invest in the students, we could really use the money.","Yes; I believe higher education should be free. There is no reason it isn't. Education is most often inaccessible due to its monetary costs and hardship. I believe all basic necessities should be free. Access to education is one of them. 
","I personally had to wait an entire quarter before being seen because there were absolutely no appointments available. I know so many people who do not  get the mental resources they need because they are told they must wait 3+ weeks to be seen. It's unacceptable, especially when the school promises access to mental health but cannot actually provide it. Mental health is paramount to academic success, there should be enough licensed mental health personnel to match the needs of students.","Yes the university could have definitely handled the situation better. The university should have responded more expediently , in addition Fraternities should be called out by name in the reports sent to students.This prevents rumors and can keep others safe. Organizations should be penalized more severely. They should be suspended or disbanded if they begin to rack up sexual assault cases. That's it. There should be a zero tolerance policy for that type of offence. ","Title IX is not enough and leaves many survivors dissatisfied. In many cases many survivors feel that there is no resolve at all. It is a step forward in the right direction, but it could definitely be improved upon.","Somewhat as  marginalized communities are usually assisted superficially.. Although there are many organizations and  clubs made and ran by those in the communities , the communities still lack the appropriate funding ,assistance and representation they need.","From the Thomas Fire to the current COVID-19 pandemic, emergencies have shown how student voices are left unheard during major academic and departamental decisions. I want to COLLABORATE with academic departments, student organizations, OSL, and other on-campus entities to PREPARE and establish an emergency PLAN that can be implemented university wide, particularly within the College of Letters and Sciences, to ensure students are supported academically, mentally, and physically especially  during these  emergencies and unprecedented times of environmental uncertainty.","I would invite students to meetings, request my fellow peers' opinions on potential bills, share my drafts with fellow students and ask how it can be approved upon. As a student I will make sure bills and amendments being made are representative of the students I'm representing. ","We need to see a UC President who makes the students its first priority.

Gabriel Bravo,sanya,Engineering Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gabriel-Bravo.jpg,,He/Him/His,2nd,Mechanical Engineering Major,,,"I am running because I want to bring change to this campus and target issues affecting the productivity and well-being of the College of Engineering. I look forward to making sure engineering students have their voices heard on adjustments to CLAS services, curriculum, availability of resources, and any other issues. This reform will ultimately develop a more successful College of Engineering as a whole.","On campus, I have been involved in an Engineering Organization - Los Ingenieros. Within this organization, I always choose to surround myself with the org’s officers to get to know leadership skills and characteristics. Additionally, I work as a student intern for the Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) of UCSB. Under this position, I perform a multitude of tasks, from student data entry to tour and major event preparation. My goal is to always get my tasks done quickly and efficiently, while simultaneously looking for new methods to improve productivity - methods that will save an organization time and money. The responsibility and discipline I have received from this position will surely benefit me as the Senator for The College of Engineering. One needs both discipline and the ability to work under great responsibilities to make sure issues are addressed with necessary action.","While in office, I would like to introduce an improvement for mental health services, CLAS for engineering courses, and food insecurity. Improved mental health services will help
with the well being of students and other internal issues. CLAS is a tutorial service that is almost always non-existent for the major engineering courses. Fighting for these CLAS services would ensure an increase in academic success and a decrease in stress endured from concepts that are difficult to comprehend in engineering courses. From my personal experience, CLAS and CLAS drop-ins are effective in getting engineering students additional practice; they serve as additional sessions to explain and break down engineering course related work. These sessions work great with our schedules, for the most part. However, for those that do not have flexible schedules, there is a much more convenient service called CLAS Drop-In (3rd floor of the SRB). CLAS drop-ins provide service to any student that signs in. If tutors were to be available for engineering coursework support (from opening to closing), grades in engineering courses would improve substantially. Moreover, the goal for food insecurity is to minimize student hunger at our university. Food issues can range from insufficient meal swipes to insufficient groceries. I want to work to make sure these issues end up declining.","I will contact the engineering student body to compile a list of all concerns and issues regarding mental health services, CLAS, and food insecurity. Additionally, if the engineering students happen to find another prevalent issue, I will make sure to address additional problems in an effective manner. This gives me the ability to directly address ongoing issues concerning engineering students. For the mental health and CLAS services, I will contact both services and explain my ideas of improvement. I will contact upperclassmen, tutors, and TA’s to ask if they would be interested in tutoring for engineering courses. Moreover, I will work to get these CLAS services in a more convenient location (closer to the Engineering side of campus) to better accommodate engineering students. Lastly, for food security, I would like to open up more food pantries on and off campus. We can set up vending machines (on and off campus) that will allow students to select a few free items via access card. In addition, I will work to have unused meal swipes roll over and allow students the ability to swipe in guests. These methods will essentially help the student body make the most of its resources.","I look to cooperate with the students of the College of Engineering. Specifically the organization I am a part of, Los Ingenieros, which embodies those who are underrepresented and are in need of resources on campus. This organization is full of students just like me, as we all work to pursue a great education given difficult circumstances. Although we lack some prior guidance for what to expect in college, we still manage to persevere and overcome such hardships to continue to succeed. Therefore, these students will help support me and my campaign, allowing my name to spread throughout the UCSB community","I will make myself available through my phone number, student email, and Zoom office hours. I will not only be able to be contacted through permanently set office hours, but I will also make myself available through Zoom appointments.","I obtain skills and characteristics of a leader from my leadership in organizations prior to attending college, as well as the leadership I withhold under my student intern position at EAOP. I am a responsible candidate that is willing to address issues brought to me directly by my student body. I understand the hardships low-income first-gen students endure and I am able to relate to that population. However, I am willing to stand for every single student under the College of Engineering, ensuring we all cooperate and develop a successful Engineering class.",Left-leaning,"Good; A.S. Senate provides numerous resources for our students, such as the A.S. Bike Shop, Financial Literacy Workshops, A.S. Food Bank, etc. A.S. Senate tries its best to reduce financial instability amongst the student body, through the accessibility of more grants or through the provisions of accessible food for our students. Although further action has been cut short due to the outbreak, I feel A.S. had more gas in the tank that we can potentially build upon for the upcoming year. I want to see further action with the COLA
movement and improvements on mental health services","Yes; The Palestinians deserve equal rights, as we all do. WE are all equally human beings. Therefore, we all deserve the same human rights. We should not be cooperating with such injust companies that discriminate against others. It is our duty to support our Palestinians people against Israel’s apartheid.","Yes; Numerous individuals are unable to attend UC’s due to its expensive tuition costs. Many endure stress, due to the outrageous tuition costs, which affects our well-being and academic performance. Many students look for ways to minimize their debt. For example, cutting back on meals leads to another prevalent issue on this campus: food insecurity. Tuition free universities will encourage more low-income, first generation students to attend while alleviating current students of such financial burdens.Additionally, low-income students always hear of the myths about how expensive college is, which is discouraging when you come from a financially disadvantaged background. All in all, this would strongly encourage many more students to attend universities and pursue a greater education.","I believe the mental health services can be improved. One way to get more service to students is to have counselors give students a small gift, snack, meal swipe, etc., while receiving counseling. Incentives get students interested to go and it would get our counselors to support more of our students. For example, some researchers on campus attract their subjects by offering a gift for their participation. I am not saying showing up to counseling is an experiment, but why not put some money towards counseling students that need it? Typically, students are more willing to participate when they know they will be benefiting much more in return. Moreover, UCSB could increase their number of peer support services. To elaborate, having counselors that have not only studied but been through similar experiences as the students seeking help could be a lot more effective. The two can share their experiences and strategies to resolve the issues they have dealt with. These steps will ultimately make students more comfortable with UCSB mental health services.","Absolutely. Problems regarding the safety of our students must always be addressed in an expedited manner. We are given modules to complete at the beginning of the school year, regarding sexual assaults that can possibly happen on and off campus. We are given set guidelines on what to do if such a horrific event were to occur. However, the University does need to develop more effective tactics for sexual assault. We need to work on ways to make those survivors feel comfortable with reporting their assaulters. Sadly, universities are only required to do the bare minimum when supporting those who have been assaulted. As a result, these cases that are reported tend to get brushed away under the rug and no one hears from them ever again. Moreover, it may even be more comfortable for those assaulted to report to CSO’s, which are relatively closer in age to these students. I’m sure it feels intimidating or embarrassing to report to a much older authoritative individual.","I do not believe Title IX is the best system to address sexual assault on UC campuses. Students are fearful of their assaulters finding out they have been reported by their victims. The students are allowed to make anonymous electronic reports, but that does
not do much justice either. To specify, the report is sent to the Title IX office, but a follow up is quite difficult when you do not have any info about the potential survivor. This is the most common form of a report being sent and that is why it is extremely difficult to have the Title IX Office perform on their end. For those cases that are reported in-person, numerous interviews are held to gather necessary information. If there is enough information, then the Title IX Office will proceed with an investigation. Afterwards, the only actions the Office can make are removing the perpetrator from campus (through suspension or expelling), adjusting the schedules of the perpetrator and the victim to make sure they do not interfere, and issuing no contact orders. Although Title IX does try its best to address sexual assault, these reports solely go under academic processes rather than undergoing criminal processes. These are reasons why students on our campus and everywhere deserve to have institutional resources that go above and
beyond what Title IX does.","UCSB has not effectively served these marginalized communities yet, but has made some noticeable improvements to serve our underrepresented population. For example, there are locations and organizations all throughout campus that cater to the underrepresented, such as the Student Resource Building, The Multicultural Center, El Centro, The Educational Opportunity Program and much more. Additionally, UCSB allows the underrepresented to hold events and fundraisers all throughout campus. This allows for culture and diversity to flourish through the community, encouraging a more inclusive community. In other words, all people are invited to such events of Black, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ communities, reducing the descrimination and encouraging equality. As a result, the underrepresented has grown stronger, yet these are only preliminary actions that leave room for improvement. For example, first-gen, low-income students should be immediately informed of peer mentors that can help guide them through their first year(s) of college. This is extremely useful for those students who do not have any family members that have had the chance to attend a university. These students may enter college not knowing what to expect. We do not want these students to feel overwhelmed their first year. The same thing goes for students who are a part of the Latinx, Black, LGBTQ+, and many more diverse groups amongst our community. Providing peer mentors for these students can effectively go a long way.","One major issue I wish to tackle is food insecurity within our student body. Food insecurity affects approximately 48% of undergraduate students. Food insecurity is a prevalent problem that affects our students mentally, financially, and academically. For example, students who have meal swipes are not allowed to swipe in additional guests. Those guests are then forced to pay for an additional meal even when the student with meal swipes may have some additional meal swipes that he/she/they may not need. Moreover, meal swipes do not roll over to each upcoming week. So, if you have any leftover meals from the previous week, they are automatically erased from your access for the next week. Although UCSB allows us to donate our meal swipes, it does not guarantee a meal swipe to our guests or friends who are hungry at the moment. From my experience, I decided to lower my amount of meal swipes to work on saving more money. Hunger affects our well being, leading to additional stress and even depression. Therefore, a new policy must be enforced to ensure less students are going hungry on this campus.","First and foremost, I’d like to treat my position as part of a direct democracy. Therefore, I am here to reach out and listen to our students to ensure their needs are met to the best that we, the A.S. Senate, can accommodate them. For example, I would work to get the student body more involved through the utilization of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. A strong percentage of students are already on social media. If each of us in the Senate were to share information regarding A.S. on the aforementioned platforms, the viewers could possibly get the word out to their friends, and we can eventually get a chain reaction to occur. Yes, we should continue to email the student body to make sure we inform the entire population. But, spamming the students’ email accounts will not do us the best justice. That is why we should work on providing information, both visual and scriptive, on all media platforms","The next UC President should work on reducing student tuition costs and protecting our underrepresented students. The next UC President should also take the COLA strikes into consideration, in order to further accommodate our graduate students in their efforts for a more livable wage. Additionally, ongoing issues with food insecurity (meal swipes for guests and rolling over meals) must be addressed. Those without meal plans are equally affected by food insecurity. With university tuition continuing to rise, financial aid suffices less and less every year. For this reason, more students are left facing more student loans and work to live from paycheck to paycheck. This causes students to take longer to earn their bachelor’s degree, with a hefty lump of debt awaiting them for the aftermath of it all. Therefore, action is much needed to reduce food insecurity cases on campus. All in all, resolution for these problems should alleviate an immense amount of stress amongst UC students and the UC community.",,,,,,,
Brandon Villarreal,sanya,Transfer Senator,Isla Vista Party,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brandon-Villarreal.jpg,,He/They,3rd,Political Science Major w/ Minor in Black Studies,,,"I am running for senate because I believe the university needs more diversity and new representation at this school. In my short time here at this institution, I have seen several events take place that are unacceptable and put our student population at risk. We need accurate representation for the marginalized communities who are most impacted by lack of resources, support, and outreach. I come from a family of immigrants, a first-generation college student myself, and a member of the LGBTQ+ community. My journey to get to this institution and succeed while here has been unique and difficult. I would like to help others by drawing from my personal experiences along with learning the needs of others. I have always gotten involved politically at every institution I have found myself at. I have served in positions ranging from class president in high school to health and safety commissioner at my former community college. I wanted to run to try to use my past experience to help make this institution a better place for all of us, not just a select few. I want to run so I can give others the opportunity to speak at the table in situations where they have previously been absent. I want to run to make a difference!","I have been at this institution for less than a full academic year, but I have still found myself staying busy from the start! My first quarter here, I was appointed as Administrative chair for Queer Commission, one of the BCUs in UCSB’s Associated Students that focuses on Queer and Trans issues. Most recently, I have been elected as the Internal Vice-President and Philanthropy Chair for UCSB’s first QTPOC sorority, Zeta Sigma Nu (ZEN). Through these organizations, I have made many meaningful connections via town halls, private meetings, and events, and have truly been able to get a sense of what our communities need. Our POC and QT communities have been underserved for far too long. I have seen how the transfer community has been forgotten about. These communities have been lumped in with everyone else. As someone who is a part of these communities, I want to bring more attention to the unique problems we face. By communicating with both current senators and candidates, I have already begun to formulate concrete plans and projects to work on. I hope that my experience, both past and present, and my knowledge about the issues we have here at UCSB can be of service to the student population.","If I were blessed enough to be elected to the senate, I plan on introducing bills as my fist act of duty. The bills I plan to introduce first will be regarding pertinent issues that I have seen during my short time here at UCSB. Transfer students face unprecedented mental health and housing issues. In addition to a sort of shock, being introduced to a new and more rigid learning environment, students must also learn to adapt to the social and financial struggles that come with transferring to a new university. I want to sponsor a bill that allocates more resources to services to provide for these students in ways that we legally can. Black and brown queer people of color are disproportionately subject to more violence and racism than their counterparts. I believe the school can do more to protect this community. I want to sponsor a bill that allocates special safehouses and areas for our community to gather. One way this can be done and one area I plan to look into is safe living spaces or living/learning communities. I believe we need more of these not only in Isla Vista but in the dorms and university apartments as well. The third bill I plan to introduce pertains to accountability. I want to see any student or organization that engages in assault be held accountable. Past organizations, who shall not be named, have gotten nothing but a slap on the wrist when their members engage in predatory behavior and/or commit crimes against their peers. There are individuals who are more concerned with these institutions/their organizations imagine than people’s lives. ","My platform is all about giving voices to those who have historically been left out and forgotten about. That could pertain to bigger politics on an international and national level or local politics regarding the institution and our community. I want to bring the issues that affect these marginalized communities into the conversation. I want to give those in these communities a seat at the table so they can use their experiences and their knowledge to help better our institution. Our issues are different and require special attention. Transfer students require different resources than newly admitted freshman. Each community within the LGBTQ+ sphere has its own issues and the whole community cannot be lumped into one big group when it comes to problem solutions. If I were blessed to be elected, I would hope that my ascension to senator as a first-generation Mexican student who is LGBTQ+ would make others feel that they belong here at this institution and that they are seen. They too can rise to high levels of power and hopefully someone after me will create far more change than I could have ever hoped to do. ","As mentioned, I am a member of the LGBTQ+ community. I am also a first- generation student from a family of Mexican immigrants. I am also a transfer student and this is my third institution that I have attended. Thankfully, there are already several organizations for these communities. La Familia de Colores, Queer Commission, the RCSGD, QTC, UndocuQueer UndocuTrans, the Transfer Student Center, etc. The list goes on and on. As mentioned, I have already developed personal relationships with many of the leaders in these organizations and we have been discussing ways in which we can better serve our peers. I have also been in contact with and have had the pleasure of assisting in creating and organizing new organizations such as Zeta Sigma Nu (ZEN) which is a new Queer and Trans People of Color Sorority and the Transfer Union which is a new organization which is meant to focus on transfer students issues that the university overlooks. I plan to hold frequent meetings with these organizations to discuss what we need to be addressing in our communities. I want to make our time here at UCSB easier and more accessible to those who come from alternative backgrounds. We all don’t share the same privileges and therefore we all cannot use the same resources in the same way. I want to address that and I know these organizations would be more than willing and more than helpful to assist.  ","If we continue with our shift to online and remote learning, I would be more than happy and ready to make myself available to my constituents. I am prepared to hold office hours, multiple times a week to make sure I am available should someone need to reach me. These office hours will be held at constituent times and random times to ensure that I am accessible to everyone and their personal schedules. I am also still somewhat close to UCSB so should the stay at home orders be dismissed, I will be on campus in person frequently for any meetings I may need to have. I also am active on all platforms of social media (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, Tumblr, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.); you won’t have to look for it in order to be able to privately message me. I have also wanted to create some kind of messaging system with transfer students so I can better communicate with my peers directly. I was thinking of someone along the lines of the Remind app or a GroupMe page. I believe one issue that the university needs to work on is communication with its students and I hope to work on that, beginning with my own personal communication to my peers.","I must be honest, I struggled with how to answer this question. I struggled because I do not know if I am the best candidate for this position. I am not all knowing and I am not all powerful. With that being said, there will always be someone who is smarter than me and someone who is more experienced than me. They might have all the answers to these problems that I am looking for. I know I have a lot to learn and a lot to work on. With that being said, I must admit that I believe my experience will help in this position. I believe that I have made personal connections to people and with organizations on this campus that deserve to have their voices heard. I know that I will work tirelessly every single day to make sure my peers feel safe, feel encouraged, and feel supported to do the things they came to this institution to do. I am growing as a person every single day and I hope to bring what I have learned from my unique experiences to UCSB to make change, for the better. I do not know if I am the best candidate for this position. As a candidate, I do not think I am in the position to make that decision. That decision is left up to the voters, y’all get to decide who is the best candidate for this position. With that being said, I can assure you I will work my hardest every single day, so vote for me and Isla Vista Party!",Left-leaning,"Fair; I rated the current work of the senate fair. I did so because I do not see how you can properly represent the diverse student population when the current representatives aren’t that diverse. I believe the representatives should reflect the student population’s beliefs and to do that you need to listen to all communities of students, not just the ones who have always been there. 
","Yes; Yes, divestment has been long overdue at UCSB. The failure to divest in a representation of who truly owns the school and who truly has a say in how this institution operates. The human rights violations that are taking place at the hand of Israel is unacceptable. Divestment has long been overdue. ","Yes; I believe the wording on this question is meant for interpretation but yes, I do believe tuition at UCSB should be free. I believe as a public institution, the university should be funded by the richest people in this country.  There are several ways we could pay for this and there are currently even presidential candidates proposing their own ways to do this. In short, yes, tuition should be free for students. ","I want to start off this answer by thanking the staff, volunteers, and workers who maintain our health services at UCSB. The services we have at this institution are a great start but they are not enough. The system we have in place is not adequate enough to meet our population's needs. My brother passed away at the end of fall quarter last year. At the beginning of winter quarter, I went out to CAPS to try and take care of my mental health so I could grieve properly. I learned firsthand the issues with our system. The long wait times, the lack of staff, the lack of funding. When I finally was able to get my referral to a therapist, I was given a list and told I had to personally find a therapist. I spent the next 2 months calling therapists from that list and communicating with CAPS to send more and more phone numbers because no therapist had called me back. Finally, I found a therapist who is able to see me and the day before I am scheduled to meet him for our first session, COVID-19 breaks out and we are issued to stay at home. My brother passed away in November and I had been trying to see someone since January. There is no reason why I was barely able to make an appointment with  an actual therapist at the end of March. That is too much time. There are students on this campus who need care urgently. There are situations that require immediate attention. We need more funding and more resources. More attention needs to be given to these issues. ","Yes, I do believe the university could and should have handled these situations better. These are predators. We have predators living in our community. We as a society deserve to know exactly who they are, where they live, what their offense was, and what the action being done will be. The university failed to tell us all of that. Not to mention they failed to tell us about the incident for a few days in the first place. This is unacceptable. It later was revealed that there weren’t credible lines of communication between departments (such as the police department and the university) and therefore, the majority of parties were unaware of the incident. This is unacceptable. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the survivors and other passionate leaders, the school has been making structural changes. More needs to be done and there needs to be accountability taken. The lack of commitment from administration is disturbing as well. Their statements of support were sent out but their actions spoke a different story. They were noticeably absent at a majority of town halls and meetings. Are our concerns not worthy of hearing in person or will its administration just scroll over them as they try to skim through their emails in the morning? Enough is enough! ","I do not believe Title IX is an adequate system to address sexual assault that happens at university of California campuses. The process in which a survivor must go through is ridiculous and can drag out for months at a time. The survivor isn’t given enough resources to meet their needs and in the process while the report is making its way through the bureaucracy, the survivor is forced to occupy the same spaces as their abuser. This is all just unacceptable. In a society and at an institution that prides itself on protecting the kids and students, I believe students are being failed miserably when it comes to this. More responsive action needs to be done and right away at that. No more lag time between departments, institutions, and consequences being taken. It is hard to say exactly what could be fixed without wanting to dismantle the whole thing and start over with a completely new system in place. Something must be done either way and it must be done soon. As we saw, there are predators out there and around us and new measurements need to be taken to make sure our students are safe. ","I believe that there are resources in place for these. With organizations and resources such as the RCSGD, Queer Commission, La Familia de Colores, the Trans Student Center, etc. there are existing places that proved vital resources to our students, however, I believe that more can be done. We need more counselors at the EOP center and more funding so they can hand out more scholarships and grants. Besides more funding, organizations such as the RCSGD, Queer Commission, and Transfer Union all need their own standing buildings and offices to get more work done. There is no reason why one organization should be sharing an office with 3 other organizations. There are resources in place but I believe it is almost just for show and tell. Just the surface needs are being met and even that is a stretch. We need to be providing more and the root of these issues need to be addressed. Affordable housing in IV and throughout the dorms, rollover meal plans, cheaper tuition costs, free/cheaper parking. Providing these would be a start to accurately serving these communities and ensuring their success here at UCSB. ","If I were blessed enough to be elected to the senate, I plan on introducing two bills simultaneously as my fist act of duty. The bills I plan to introduce will be regarding two pertinent issues. Transfer students face unprecedented mental health and housing issues. In addition to a sort of shock, being introduced to a new and more rigid learning environment, students must also learn to adapt to the social and financial struggles that come with transferring to a new university. I want to sponsor a bill that allocates more resources to services to provide for these students in ways that we legally can. Black and brown queer people of color are disproportionately subject to more violence and racism than their counterparts. I believe the school can do more to protect this community. I want to sponsor a bill that allocates special safehouses and areas for our community to gather. One way this can be done and one area I plan to look into is safe living spaces or living/learning communities. I believe we need more of these not only in Isla Vista but in the dorms and university apartments as well. There are several ways to make our community feel safe. ","As mentioned in some of my previous answers, I believe one of the school’s main areas that needs improvement is its communication. That is where I would start when it came to accessibility to the average student. I want to research the best tool for outreach with the student population. I will look at past methods I have used such as twitter accounts for specific audiences to tweet out information and to receive feedback or the Remind app to send out information and have one on one private conversations for feedback. I will also be searching for other methods that we could possibly use. I believe the school could do better and I will be working through the necessary channels to see what could be improved. I was also thinking of setting up outposts of information throughout IV where people can get information about services that the campus offers and that they can get throughout the community. In times of distress, someone might not have access to campus and/or the internet and therefore we need this information readily available all throughout areas that are heavily populated by students. There are many small steps that can be taken right away and while I am doing research about what can and cannot be done legally, I believe those things can be done to help our students immediately. ","In the search for the next UC President there are several factors that need to be taken into account. First and foremost, I believe that the next president should be a former educator. I believe she should have been a public-school teacher at some point in her career. I also believe it should be a woman; we need more women leading our institutions and students. I believe the UC system is full of passionate and politically active students. Every year, there are several issues that students bring to the attention of administration and several movements that began on campus, most recently for example the COLA movement, starting at UCSC. We need a president who supports our concerns and addresses them right away. A progressive thinking president is what our universities deserve. In our ever-changing society, we continue to adapt to structural changes. Our next president needs to be able to adapt and be willing at that to the changes that the students need. She shouldn’t be forced to do it; it should come naturally as soon as the problem is presented. She will be the president; she can make a solution happen. It will be interesting to see who will end up replacing Janet as president. ",,,,,,,

With Safety and Wellbeing being the top priority of our university, we must require that officials and judicial processes take immediate appropriate action. But not acting swiftly for students, victims, and survivors, indirectly condones the asks of preexisting violence. The situation must be handled differently so that all students have access to the vital information that can inform them of a possible incoming danger. By increasing and supporting efforts for prevention, awareness, and accountability, our university can prevent this situation from reoccurring.","Title IX is a positive step toward a brighter future for survivors. However, I currently do not believe Title IX is the most adequate system but Survivors have voiced it is not enough.

My experience in AS on Committee on Committees helped me understand what works (and what really just doesn’t) in our association, and I’m ready to turn that into positive change for our engineers. 

I’m often faced with comments from non-engineering students such as, “You don’t seem like the typical engineer I’d expect,” or “I don’t have any other engineering friends.” My time in the college has shown me that there’s diversity in our college, and the reason we’re often not seen is systemic. My goals this term are to create more opportunities on campus for engineering students to engage with non-engineering activities and programs, to offer our unique skillset (as so many others on campus have) and to gain from others’ perspective. 

Our campus is strong when working, united, towards the betterment of all students -- it’s time to get AS behind our backs. 
","The best student leaders are the ones who understand the community and can turn experience into movement. Working in campus-org leadership has prepared me in understanding what students groups need to further their work and I’m set on being a resource to these community-engagers. Our student body is vibrant because of our wealth of communities -- let’s come together to provide our students access to campus resources and create experiences together. 

I’ve been part of the Gaucho Tour Association, Model UN, Adventure Programs, Sigma Eta Pi, Sunrise Movement, TableTalk, TAMID, AS, Engineers Without Borders, Design For America + more -- it’s really been a ride 😅! The UCSB campus has provided me with so many opportunities and my goal is to provide back. 
","-INCREASE CAPSTONE FUNDING for independent projects so engineering students can focus on personal interests such as sustainability rather than defense corporations. 
-EXPAND FOOD RESOURCES on campus to target where student populations spend the most time, ensuring food is never a question of cost, time or accessibility. 
-ENGAGE CLAS SERVICES to cover lower-division classes with at least 50 students to ensure students begin their studies on campus with the proper support and resources. 
-ADVOCATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH on campus by resolving AS towards finding innovative methods to fund increased CAPS support on campus and continue programs such as Peer Advising that bring the community together in supporting one another. 
","Ensure basic needs and improve academic support. Focusing on improved food and mental health services will help students’ holistic wellbeing, and improved academic resources will support students to excel in their coursework while having more time to take care of themselves and focus on their interests -- these are two aspects of campus life that I’ve seen in my peers to be pressing matters. 

I’ll be working with the vast resources that AS holds in placing funding behind our goals -- millions of student-sourced dollars that deserve to be spent the way that students need. 

I’ll liaise closely with student groups, focused on engineering groups, to ensure that student needs are heard and properly brought to the table. 

And I’ll work with faculty from across the departments to see where we can find interdisciplinary opportunities for our students. We are learning actionable skills -- we should utilize them to make our community more resilient. 
","Engineers: Engineering Student Council (as a given), ASME, IEEE and AIChE, to get representational up-to-date views on what engineers are looking for on campus. 

Professional Orgs: SWE, Los Ingenieros, NSBE, Engineers Without Borders, Professional Fraternities (ASK, PSR, Theta Tau, etc), and Design for America to engage communities where engineers tend to spend time -- all in attempts to reach students in the communities they care about most. 

My platform is only as strong as the support it receives from the people. My direct aim is to create community dialogue on finding enactable positive change, and my time will be spent first and foremost towards creating that platform. My determination to create interdisciplinary communication will help lead those thoughts into action, but it starts with clear dialogue. 
","Walk in office hours continue to be effective during stay-at-home orders, as I’ve been doing in other leadership positions as of yet. My phone, email, Facebook and Zoom are all openly available (which I all check hyper-frequently), emails through the CoE listserv regarding my support for engineering students, and personal reach-outs to campus leaders so they know I’m keen to hearing their ideas. 
","I wish I had the chance this quarter to better get to know the others running for the CoE position -- I’m sure that any of us would be great candidates in creating real change for CoE students. I’m believe I’m qualified and truly believe that I would make a strong representative for our students, due to my engagement with the CoE faculty and advisors in creating the school’s first Independent Major, through my extracurricular connections across various communities throughout campus providing me with the instant ability to work with those groups, through my understanding of what engineering students are interested in, and that my visions for change aren’t deterred by the ability of previous Senates to enact change. A vote for Nadav Kempinski is a vote for direct focus on the population, rather than just the ideas within me. 
","Left-leaning
","Good: Given my time studying abroad during Fall, a frenzied Winter and an online Spring, I was unable to first-hand witness what the 70th Senate has accomplished. In the past I’ve witnessed a toxic environment within the Senate, providing a terrible role model for other campus leaders. I’ve heard the 70th Senate has provided a conducive environment for improving student conditions -- along with signalling support for this year’s important COLA wildcat strike -- I applaud their work.
","No: For transparency, I was born in Israel and have no interest in boycotting my country, my friends or my family who live there. I’ve attended both BDS meetings my first 2 years and witnessed the amount of sheer emotion that our campus brings to the conversation, and have no faith in policy’s ability to support campus through this emotional struggle. I’ve been in favor of conversation between both sides and finding common ground. I have stated before and would continue to support a complete divestment of the UC from companies who engage in warfare or human rights violations. ","Yes: It may not happen while we’re in our undergraduate studies, but cost-barriers have no place stopping bright minds who choose education. Grants and scholarships are nowhere near the service they need to be, and the method we utilize to test students’ ability to gain access to additional funding (ACT and SAT scores, their ability to write) are flawed. The UC will have to find alternative methods of funding, and a slow transition would need to occur, but I believe it is both possible and inevitable.","Far from adequate. When it’s common to hear that students who seek support are finding waiting times of weeks to months, for issues that are much more present and severe for students, there’s an obvious lacking in services for our size in population and need. This isn’t just on our campus -- the US and California are all lacking in support services and funding to meet the needs of students. We need to push for advocacy on the state and federal level for further funding, we need to push for innovation from our therapists and social workers, and we need to focus our on-campus resources to foster supportive communities. 
","Although I was abroad and not present to understand the situation, and I am lacking in the specifics of what occurred, it has been common knowledge that university campuses are ripe with sexual assault cases across the nation. It is imperative for campus administration to take all allegations of sexual assault seriously, to investigate community members’ potential lack of safety, and to ensure that students can feel comfortable in the greater community. A student body that does not feel comfortable in the midst of its fellow students needs to be addressed.","It’s been saddening to hear the sheer amount of cases that deal with Title IX on UCSB campus, and although I do not know the full extent that Title IX either supports or inhibits those who experience sexual assault, I will continue to be a supporter and ally for those who demand reform on our university campus to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in our homes, on our campus and in our community. Title IX’s role in increasing student engagement in campus-affiliated activities for all regardless of gender identity of expression should be maintained, and we should strive beyond federal policy to enable further engagement.","I don’t personally identify as a part of historically underrepresented communities on campus and therefore cannot speak for their experiences on campus and in the area, or as to whether our campus is providing the resources and outreach necessary for them to succeed. As a part of the Gaucho Tour Association, I’ve been impressed with our focus on outreach towards underrepresented communities and continuing our designation as #1 Hispanic Serving Institute in the United States, yet this is only one measure of the work we’re doing for one group of students. 

I feel that our campus is far from properly serving these communities as stratification between communities is extremely prevalent -- only a community that engages communally can be seen as a resilient one. I will support all measures that help bring underrepresented groups to the table, to ensure the presence of resources on campus allowing students’ access to information and support, and outreach programs that help inspire youth from communities across the state to consider higher education as accessible and offer financial support to do so. 
","Increased food access on campus. Buildings or facilities which see high levels of engagement from the student population should be given funds to offer healthy foods to the students who utilize the space. Considering for example the CAD Lab, a room which often sees 200 students filter through during a given day and spending hours for each visit, its department should be given the resources to offer students food so that they can focus on their studies without compromise on nutrition. I’d aim to work with the UC Global Food Initiative, the AS Food Bank, Calfresh representatives and the departments on campus to offer this program to students and ensure its effectiveness. 
","Students have their own activities and ongoings that are important to their lives -- we should focus on improving accessibility and transparency without increasing necessity or time commitment for keeping up on what’s going on. A simple revamp of the AS website from link-based information to dynamic offerings could provide clarity as to bill and resolution updates instead of the current web of broken links, offer up-to-date Senator Office Hours with locations, could provide all upcoming events and bill considerations in a clear fashion and offer the proper social media handles to contact for further information. Marketing of this single address would provide the resource necessary for students who are interested in engaging in Associated Students to do so, without further burdening the body with a legislative focus. I’d be happy to draft a site and seek approval for the integration.

Those who wish to become a part of AS should be kept up to date with all openings, and those aiming for candidacy into the Executive or Legislative branches should understand what actions are taken by students in those roles -- as a Senator I would work to provide transparency in role and action, to both inspire others to engage in the legislative process and to show that students in all positions of power on campus have the ability to inspire change. 
","The job of UC President is vast and as undergraduates we often don’t see the entirety of the role, but I would expect the next UC President to have the ability to negotiate with unions and students on campus without utilizing threatening tactics such as removing community members from the community. I fully supported the COLA wildcat strikes this past quarter and continue to do so, and will further my support for the people who work to make the day-to-day operations of this university possible.",,,,,,,
Surya Pugal,max,Engineering Senator,Independent,http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SenatePhoto.jpg,,He/Him/His,2nd,Computer Science Major and Social Justice Minor,,,"When I first started at UCSB, I was daunted by the prospects of college, struggling to cope with being away from home while acclimating to a new environment. My first quarter was rough to say the least, as I found myself struggling with sleep deprivation, irregular meals, and an overwhelming pressure to succeed in my courses. However, it's because of the support of my professors and friends who've reached out to me that I've been able to make it this far and validate to myself that I do belong in this amazing community of like-minded engineers.
 I’m running for senate because I want to make sure that no student feels like they are less than, unworthy, or not enough. Sometimes the rigor of this university can easily make you feel like you’re not smart enough and that you somehow slipped through the cracks to get to where you are. Being in student government would give me a chance to be a part of the decision making process and advocate for my friends and peers. As cliche as it sounds, I’m running because I want to get the opportunity to use my skills and experiences to  work with the people around me and shape the university for the better. 
","I have been a tutor for five quarters for lower-division computer science courses, which and has given me the opportunity to hear out students’ concerns regarding the curriculum, as well as more personal concerns about coping with the workload and stress that accompany their courses. I have also been involved more recently in the CS Undergraduate Curriculum Restructuring Team, working in a team of five computer science undergrads under Professor Richert Wang to help reshape CS16, 24, and 32 (introductory sequence in computer science) to provide more engaging material to better immerse students in the learning experience and create projects which they can be proud of. We are also working to add a CS24 placement exam, to provide students who have taken AP Computer Science the opportunity to skip out of CS16. 

I am currently a member of the Engineering Student Council, an organization that seeks to promote recreational events on campus pertaining to engineering, as well as facilitate the interaction of different engineering clubs to promote more interclub spaces. In the future, I hope to promote workshops on how to procure research in engineering, something which is sorely lacking with COE and is more geared towards L&S students.
","I hope to introduce a bill to increase funding for tutoring programs pertaining to engineering on campus. The computer science tutoring program, for instance, is relatively new and the amount of tutors the program can accept is significantly limited by funding, resulting in tutors only being able to be serve lower division computer science courses (only in Winter 2020 were we able to get to expand the course to CS130B, in which tutors were in high demand). 

I also want to author a bill to promote the creation of a COVID-19 financial relief fund and creation of an accompanying committee pertaining to COVID-19 relief. Covid-19 is the single biggest issue that students currently faced and introduced a myriad of problems such as unprecedented job loss and increased xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment. We need to ensure that the UCSB learning environment is still accommodating of people’s financial needs, which for many has taken a turn for the worse in what appear to be uncertain times. 

Finally, I want to push for a bill to add mental health advisors within engineering advising, as students who are experiencing stress as a result of the large workload that may come with their questions will find it comforting to get not only practical, but personal support in the process of asking for help.
","My platform is rooted in educational access and mental health. My approach to addressing the issue of educational access is three-fold. First is increasing minority representation within STEM. To do this, I am  going to work with clubs dedicated to pushing for adequate representation of minorities. Also, I want to sponsor a bill in senate pertaining to a COVID-19 financial relief fund, allowing for students who are disproportionately affected by the circumstances that have arisen as a result of the pandemic to be able to still have access to a secure learning environment, with minimal burden. Finally, I want to expand existing tutoring programs to ensure that students are able to request for help from their peers in classes that are understaffed or extremely difficult. This pertains specifically to CLAS and the current undergraduate learning assistance program within COE
        
With regards to mental health, I want to push for imposter syndrome and anxiety workshops, which are prevalent within STEM. This will be done in conjunction with CAPS and Student Health. Furthermore, I’m seeking to introduce a bill to streamline the transition of mental health resources online.  All of this will help to destigmatize mental health and help students feel secure. 
","First, I want to work with CAPS to assist with improving existing mental health facilities and programs, as well as aiding with the online transition of mental health resources. Also, I’m hoping to collaborate with CAPS or the CS ULA’s (computer science undergraduate learning assistants) to increase and improve tutoring resources for the upcoming school year.

I will be additionally working with the Engineering Student Council, of which I am currently a member of to oversee engineering club activities as well as try and facilitate club collaboration, not just within COE to cultivate inter-club spaces. If elected, I’m also hoping to work with WiCS (Women in Computer Science), oSTEM, SWE (Society of Women Engineers), Los Ingenieros, and a number of other organizations dedicated to pushing for adequate representation of women, LGBTQ+, Latinx, and other minority groups within STEM. Also, to help students destress and provide recreational events, I’m seeking to collaborate with Tau Beta Pi and Theta Tau, who specialize in helping promote a welcoming environment for engineering students. Organizations like SBHacks and WomxnHacks, which provide a medium for the creation of engineering projects through hackathons, are also groups that I’m seeking to interact with. Finally, although not an organization, I’m hoping to work with the lower division computer science professors and faculty to get additional insight on what students need most.
","Firstly, I will hold office hours both through Zoom, depending on the status of COVID-19. I will also be available via appointment, and do my best to work around the schedules of others. I’ll also try and set up a website where students can address their concerns about particular issues. Other means of communication that students could contact me through would be email and phone call. Furthermore, if elected, I will seek out and work with like-minded and passionate students to determine what issues are important and propose solutions for said issues. For lower-division courses, I will try to contact professors and send out surveys at the beginning and end of each quarter to get student input about what issues are most important to them. Also, during the campaign process, I plan on making a Facebook group regarding my campaign and what I plan to do. If elected, I will use the group as another medium for students to get in touch with me to ask me questions. Although I’m still learning how to use Instagram and Snapchat, those are also viable means for students to voice their concerns or questions. Finally, I will work with the COE office to make routine email announcements for important issues.","I have done everything I can to the best of my ability, and if elected to Senate, will continue to pursue the same degree of hard work. If people vote for you to be in a position of authority, they are effectively putting their trust in you, something which I will not abuse. I am not faultless and make mistakes, but I will never hide this from the people I work -- transparency is key as a senator. 

Over the past five quarters I have tutored for computer science, I have been able to serve as not only a peer mentor but a personal friend for many. Being able to play a part in their successes has made me thankful for this gratifying job I have. I believe my empathetic nature will help me in understanding people’s needs when working with them. Most of all, being able to bring out the best in people brings out the best in me.

This university has provided me a home away from home, and being able to do my part in improving the campus would be an immense privilege. My policies, platforms, experiences, and organizational involvement reflect my personal character, something which I believe embodies what is needed for the College of Engineering senator position. 
","Left-leaning
","Good: The 70th senate has passed several bills, such as meal plans to provide options to roll over leftover meals and promote disarmament of I.V police, to the benefit of the student community. However, there is a lot more that needs to be done with regards to mental health and access to assistance with upper-division engineering courses. Very few, if any, resolutions focused on the engineering community have been passed, let alone discussed within this year’s senate. There needs to be more engagement between the engineering community and the senate representatives to ensure that appropriate needs are being met. 
","Yes: Any corporation that exploits the suffering of people for personal benefit must be held accountable. However, a large reason why the previous attempt to pass a resolution on this failed was due to concerns about encouraging anti-semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment. To avert concerns and ensure attempts at passing said bill are successful, I would do so under a blanket resolution calling for divestment from companies that profit from the perpetration of human rights abuses worldwide, and not just centered in Israel. Palantir, which recruits on UC campuses and has frequently aided ICE in their operations, is an example of this.","Yes: As a set of public institutions, the UC’s have an obligation to ensure unfettered access to education, regardless of income status. Existing financial aid programs, such as Pell Grants and Cal Grants, are not sufficient enough alone to address demonstrated financial need. At the very least, in light of current circumstances, students ought to see a significant reduction in tuition due to diminished access to campus resources.

Making UCSB tuition-free would both address the overwhelming accumulation of student debt and draw in more low-income applicants who otherwise perceived college as an unaffordable investment. 
","CAPS and Student Health have done an adequate job when it comes to taking care of students’ mental health issues. Student Health has put on a number of events dedicated to ensuring that the student body feels safe and is able to cope with the workload and stress that can prove overwhelming at times. Also, CAPS has offered facilities including counseling services and a mental health peers program, both of which have helped students in times of need. However, a large number of students are unaware about CAPS services, particularly within engineering. To address this issue, I plan on working with lower-division course professors to post information about CAPS on the class forums (Gauchospace, Piazza, etc.) as well as working with the mental health peers program to help advertise CAPS services during the first two weeks on lecture, when students are getting acquainted with their classes. Furthermore, I plan on working with select clubs (WiCS, oSteam, Los Ingenieros, SASE, etc.) as well as the CS office, to hold workshops about imposter syndrome and anxiety, to both destigmatize mental health and ensure that students never see themselves as unworthy or undeserving. In light of COVID-19, I also want to help introduce resolutions to help facilitate access to mental health services online to make sure needs are being met.
","There was a lot the university could and should have done with regards to addressing the reports of sexual violence on campus. The university states that rules and regulations that were in place prohibited them from responding faster, but the fact that sexual assault within fraternity spaces continues to be a recurring problem is indicative of the lack of proper regulations that have not been instituted and enforced by the administration. Firstly, we need to introduce regular workshops about sexual assault and consent, either in the form of a senator or in conjunction with Student Health. Current online info sessions are irregularly in place and as evidenced by recent events, have negligible impact on curbing sexual assault. Furthermore, we need an independent third party to oversee the IFC and major events conducted by fraternities to ensure all respective people are held accountable in a timely manner in situations where sexual violence arises. The current method of oversight has shown to be ineffective and only works as a temporary measure. 
","With the introduction of Title IX has come the decreased perpetuation of educational gender stereotypes and increased access to career opportunities for women. Nonetheless, Title IX alone is not an adequate measure for adressing sexual assault on college campuses. Despite its presence, we have observed a number of sexual assault cases within UCSB and has little to no effect on deterring sexual violence. Furthermore, the ambiguity in the way Title IX was easily exploited by the current presidential administration to promote, according to the New York Times, a strict definition of gender on a biological basis by using the person’s sex at birth. This conflation of gender and sex invalidates the presence of transgender students, as evidenced by UC Berkeley senator Isabella Chow’s refusal to affirm a bill to protect transgender students from violence as well as the more recent case of transphobia at a Sigma Nu party this Februrary. As mentioned in the response to question 13, UCSB must enact additional regulations on fraternity spaces, as well as push for an independent third party to work with the IFC. This way, we are able to reduce the number of sexual assault cases, as well as better hold all involved people responsible.
","UCSB has a number of different facilities dedicated to promoting a welcoming community for students of all backgrounds. From the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity to the various organizations pushing for representation of underrepresented communities within STEM and other exclusive spaces, UCSB has made a strong effort to combat discrimination within the community. However, the campus has also failed to take decisive action when it mattered most.

The anti-black rhetoric experienced by the BSU last February when meeting with administration to advocate for increased black student resources and the construction of a Malcolm X Center is one such glaring example. During a party hosted by Sigma Nu, the administration failed to immediately hold anyone accountable for the evident transphobia and bigotry first addressed on the subreddit r/UCSantaBarbara. And more recently, the perpetuation of COVID-19 related xenophobia, particularly within online forums pertaining to UCSB such as Free and For Sale, a Facebook group for selling items, have gone largely unaddressed by administration, despite the fact that news outlets such as the LA Times and USA TODAY have reported specifically on these incidents. Inaction should never be a valid course of action, and future ASUC senators need to call out when it happens. 

","If elected, the first resolution I intend to pass would be pushing for the institution and expansion of a COVID-19 Financial Relief Fund. Right now, COVID-19 is the biggest issue students face on campus, resulting in the transition to online resources, unprecedented job loss, and increased xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment. We need to ensure that the UCSB learning environment is still accommodating of people’s financial needs, which for many has taken a turn for the worse in what appear to be uncertain times. The resolution will be modeled off that of UC Berkeley’s, which was proposed in early April by Senator Romario. 
        To implement this, I hope to work with Student Affairs and well as clubs representing underrepresented communities, whom, as Senator Romario points out, will be disproportionately affected by the increased barriers in health and social services. The bill would also push for the creation of an independent committee to oversee the collection of funds accumulated from financial grants and crowdfunding. The committee would additionally aid in the online transition of certain organizations and resources, such as mental health (CAPS) and tutoring services (CLAS or alternative tutoring club). The resolution may be split into two resolutions if the scope ends up getting too large.
","One thing I would do is to increase engagement with clubs and organizations on campus. To do this, I would schedule a meeting time with all engineering-related clubs to address concerns they have. I would also facilitate additional club gatherings through ESC, or the Engineering Student Council, to provide a space for clubs to interact with one another and determine mutual needs. 
I also intend to draft meaningful resolutions within the engineering community, such as expanding our mental health program and CAPS capacities, as well as expanding tutoring capabilities of CLAS, the CS tutor program, and other clubs which provide tutoring services. Right now, not a lot has been achieved by the senate with regards to engineering, consequently resulting in a disconnect between the senate and the students which it serves. 
Also, allowing for students to readily access bills and resolutions provides a much needed sense of transparency and keeps students posted on where the senate and its members stand on particular issues of importance. One way to do this would be to provide a readily accessible link to find the bills and resolutions discussed by the senate on the website. 
Finally, offering polls and surveys within engineering courses during the start and end of each quarter regarding what issues students currently see as important and possible solutions that they would suggest would provide an outlet for students to voice their input and feel they are being heard.  
","The next UC president has to be a proponent for diversity within UC campuses and push for adequate representation of students from a variety of different backgrounds and experiences. This also calls for increased acceptance of in-state students, whose proportional acceptance rates have been decreasing over the past couple of years, as well as helping undocumented students at any UC with the aid they need. Certain college campuses have faced heavy criticism for enabling ICE operations, and we need to ensure that this is not the case for our successive president. He or she also needs to be able to adequately address the COLA movement, pertaining to ensuring adequate living conditions and wages for graduate student workers, and be willing to work with labor unions. Furthermore, said president needs to be decisive and frequently reach out to the student community to address common issues, something of utmost importance especially now given the increased social disconnect as a result of COVID-19. As Felicia Mello from CalMatters points out, the president’s “decisions will shape not only their institutions, but the future of public higher education in the state and nationally”, so we must ensure that whoever we pick truly has the students’ interests at heart.
