Amelia Rowe,Sindhu,Off-Campus Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23131427/Amelia-Rowe-2090.jpg,,She/her,First-year,History of Public Policy and Law,,,"I am running for Associated Students senate because I want to seek and amplify student
voices. When I first arrived on UCSB's campus, I had no idea what Associated Students was, or
where my fees go each quarter. Joining AS and working in the Strategic Operations Office this
past school year has shown me that our association can achieve anything: creating an accessible
transportation shuttle system, expanding EBT options in the community, and even bringing 200
iPads to students.

As a senator, I want to use my platform to not only amplify students' voices, I want to
increase campus awareness of AS programs and resources. I've often overheard conversations
where students express unique ideas that would greatly improve our campus and I believe the
senate should be taking greater action to bring these ideas to fruition.

I've built my goals around those outlined in the Student Strategic Plan, which includes
suggestions from students directly. During my time in office, I want to make syllabi available to
students directly on GOLD, create a transportation system between public transportation stops
in the area and campus to increase student safety, restart the AS Public Safety Commission, and
more.

Overall, I'm hoping to increase transparency and access to student representatives here. If you have any questions feel free to email me at ameliarowe@ucsb.edu!","Simply living in the Isla Vista/Goleta area has exposed me to the unique issues and
challenges that each student faces during their time here. This, paired with my time working in
the Strategic Operations Office has prepared me best to be a senator. I have come to understand
the goals of the association, the needs of the community, and the priorities of the student body.

Additionally I have been involved in several student organizations including Women in
Business and Her Campus UCSB, both of which have expanded my view of campus
organizations and student priorities.","While in office, I want to pass a resolution to stop the demolition of student health.
Each and every student should have access to healthcare on this campus, so I will resolve
to identify stakeholders and address the root of this issue. Associated students' lock-in
fees largely fund Student Health, so its demolition calls to question the presence of
adequate services to meet this overwhelming fiscal contribution.

Another goal of mine is to compile and market a list of financial resources
accessible to students. This goal is detailed under Philanthropy & Financial Support goal
#2 in the Student Strategic Plan. To achieve this, I will compile the resources and then
create a resolution to add the information to the Associated Students website. My ultimate
goal is to codify this resource and keep it updated.

Additionally, I want to create a bill to introduce an AS internal training program.
Ideally, I want to make information regarding associated students' processes more
accessible as a whole. I discuss this goal in more depth under question number 15.","My personal ideology is based on transparency, efficiency, and representation. To
achieve my goals in office, I will be resourceful and persistent.","So far, I have had the opportunity to work alongside entities like the Commission on
Student Well-being, Public & Mental Health Commission, and the Human Rights Board to
complete projects and discuss student well-being. In the future, I hope to continue working with
these entities to achieve our shared goals.

Additionally, I hope to form relationships with the Isla Vista Tenants Union, Isla Vista
Community service district, and other off-campus organizations to further the association’s
goals.","As outlined in Associated Students legal code, I will hold three weekly office hours
in person in one of the appropriate outlined off-campus locations. In addition to in-person
office hours, I intend on holding a zoom office hours session to accommodate those with
scheduling, transportation, or health issues prohibiting them from attending in person. I
want to help increase transparency between myself and my constituents, so not only will I
be available during these times, I will respond quickly to emails and social media

Amelia Rowe
messages, create a google form with a space for anonymous suggestions, and schedule
appointments promptly when requested.","I am the best candidate for this position because I understand when to listen and when
to act. The best student representatives are those who can acknowledge and appreciate the fact
that we will never fully understand the challenges and trials each individual student faces. I will
never know what it’s like to be persecuted based on my race, religion, or gender identity. While
I have faced my own challenges, my perspective alone can’t account for the thousands of
students I will represent as a senator.

What makes me a qualified candidate for off-campus senate is my ability to tune in and
take note of students' voices. This quality is vital to ensure I represent all of my constituents,
and not just those with similar interests to me.",Left-leaning,"Good.  While the 73rd senate definitely faced challenges, I have
worked alongside many of these senators and know that they have been operating in good faith
and working towards several goals to improve the lives of their constituents. There is always
room for improvement, but I believe that the 22-23 senate has addressed the needs of the
student body well.",Yes,"Yes. Tuition was first charged to UC students in 1970
following a strong push from Ronald Reagan and his administration. It’s vital
we understand the historic socio-economic and political implications of
charging tuition for a public university. Education should be free, and should not be used to leverage power over those who can not afford or access it.","After attending the town hall meeting addressing mental health services at UCSB, I
have a better understanding of the services available to students. While the resources available
are comprehensive - there are still gaps. From conversations with other students and mental
health advocates, I have found two areas UCSB is currently lacking in:

1. Peer group mental health groups. I have heard from other students that there is a
lack of comprehensive group counseling services available. Peer group services
take pressure off of students and create a unique space for students to share and
relate with one another regarding mental health issues.
2. Accessibility of existing resources. Resources are not typically widely available,
and are not compiled adequately. There needs to be a comprehensive database of
mental health resources available. There are a ton of amazing services students
are not taking advantage of, despite their fees funding these services, and
increasing student awareness of these resources is key to improving our impact
on students.

I believe that mental health services at UCSB can be improved but currently cover a
diverse range of issues. To address this problem our association can work with CAPS and other
student organizations or entities with a stake in mental health to make them aware of the gaps
in services here on campus and ultimately improve the services offered.","As stated on the university’s Title IX office website, “The mission of the Title IX and
Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office (Title IX Office) is to ensure all UCSB
community members fulfill the campus’ commitment to create and maintain a work and
academic environment free of sex discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual violence.” To
support survivors of sexual assault, this office should work efficiently to provide students with
resources, create safety nets including emergency alarm stations on campus and in the
surrounding community, and take appropriate disciplinary action against those who violate Title
IX in any form to ensure the safety and well-being of students with all gender identities on our
campus.","For the most part, UCSB students and faculty have a great appreciation for diversity
here on campus. As our community continues to progress and strive to make our campus a safe
and comfortable space for ALL students, it’s important to acknowledge and condemn those
who uphold systems of oppression and discrimination on our campus. Opening conversations
for those who are uneducated is the first step. Events like the Trans Town Hall and instituting
land acknowledgements across all UCSB programming are great first steps.

I believe that UCSB is making a great effort to serve historically underrepresented
groups, and I sincerely hope we can continue this effort and make this a more accepting
environment for students with all identities and from all backgrounds.","As a senator, I will take action to improve students' experience just as I have in my
current position. The first action I want to pursue is solidifying training for new associated
students members - a goal outlined in the Student Strategic Vision document. When I joined, I
didn't know how to reach out to senators, bring forward ideas, or where to go to accrue funding.
A more streamline entry process would greatly improve the state of associated students as a
whole - allowing students to work more effectively in their positions.

Amidst internal dysfunction, it's important we evaluate the root of issues and work to
solve them internally. In a more efficient space, we'll be able to achieve our common goal: to
help and serve our constituents. I would also hope to make this information available to all
students. If they’re more aware of what the senate can do for them, I think they’d take
initiative, sponsor bills and even suggest new ones.","One of the biggest issues I’ve observed as both a student and a member of the
association is lack of awareness about what associated students does and how it impacts our
campus. Many students are simply unaware of how to get involved, how their fees are
allocated, and why it’s important to vote in these elections.
As a senator, my first action would be establishing a consistent social media presence.
I’d like to detail the projects being progressed throughout the association and discuss the ways
we are working to improve upon flaws still present at the university. My next step would be
continuing to work with the Strategic Operations Office and Chief Operating Officer to build
their database of current and past projects that target student’s goals for the association. Working in strategic operations this past year has shown me the potential for their website to
serve as a palatable database - one that students can easily click through to familiarize
themselves with each entity and branch in associated students.

Most importantly, I want to listen to students and work towards the things most
important to them. Often I think student representatives are so focused on their personal goals
they ultimately lose view of the most pressing issues on campus. Continuing to engage with
students, dropping in on organization meetings, and liaising with students during office hours",NO ANSWER,NO ANSWER,NO ANSWER

Within the last school year, it has been seemingly impossible to escape the news of Associated Student shutdowns and scandals. In fact, UCSB spent most of the Fall and Winter quarter lacking a functioning senate at all, which halted much A.S. activity and severely damaged the image and legitimacy of the senate. Although A.S. is now on a more stable trajectory, the months-long lack of a functioning senate shows how there are fundamental issues with the current A.S. structure. Thousands of UCSB students, staff and community members rely on A.S. to help organize events and provide crucial campus services. It is extremely important to assure that the senate continues functioning at full capacity throughout the year, and that a repeat of earlier this year does not occur again. I believe fully in the importance of good governance, and as senator, I will do all I can to ensure that the students of UCSB have a senate that constantly works to represent the interests and needs of our campus community.","As a student at UCSB, I have been actively involved in a variety of campus events and organizations. During the 2022 general election, I worked as a campaign intern to help bring fellow students to the polls and increase the political power of students across Isla Vista and UCSB. I was also involved with efforts to increase the required turnout threshold from three to seven percent for the special IVP election, which helped assure that the results more accurately reflected the views and opinions of UCSB students. I’ve also been involved in other intra-campus organizations, such as the California College Democrats, where I’ve been able to contact and learn from students and student government leaders from across the UC system. I found that this has been especially helpful in exchanging ideas and learning from our fellow peer campuses. In addition, I’m currently serving as the Executive Intern for the UCSB Campus Democrats, and I am a member of the Sierra Club’s Youth Adult Advisory Board against tobacco, where young people and college students from across the state work to reduce the impact of tobacco and tobacco waste in our communities. Given my past experience in a variety of governmental, activist and advisory organizations, I strongly believe that I have the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively serve as a UCSB senator.",[NO ANSWER],"I consider my platform to be a three-pronged approach to senate and student government. My first priority is working on increasing the functionality and efficiency of the senate and A.S. more broadly. A functioning senate is absolutely necessary to carry out the duties of A.S., which is why it is highlighted as my number one priority. My second priority is on improving equity and representation on our campus. I’ve been fortunate enough to interact with many of the student groups working to increase the representation of historically marginalized and underrepresented communities on campus, and I’ve been extremely impressed with the work these organizations have done to uplift students. I would like to work with these groups, as well as other students and community members from historically marginalized backgrounds, to continue building a stronger, more resilient UCSB. My third, although far from last, priority is on increasing the accessibility and transparency of A.S. and senate. Many students feel a strong disconnect between themselves and senate, which is very unfortunate considering the importance of A.S. to the daily lives of UCSB students. However, this disconnect is far from unfounded. Shutdowns, controversies and inefficiencies have defined A.S. for the last school year, and I believe that A.S. has not been able to effectively reconnect and restore trust with the student body. By eliminating organizational inefficiencies and reaching out to more campus and student groups, I’m hopeful that the senate will be able to build back its reputation and bring more students into student government.","First, I would be absolutely willing and interested in working with any campus organizations or entities looking to collaborate on creating and passing legislation. But in order to specifically achieve my platform goals, I am interested in supporting and working with A.S. groups like A.S. Student Coalition on Racial Equity (A.S. SCORE) and the Queer and Trans Commission, as well as other campus organizations like the Campus Democrats and Planned Parenthood Generation Action. Furthermore, I would like to work collaboratively with my fellow senators to ensure that the senate is maintaining its roles and responsibilities, which in itself is one of my major platform priorities.","Transparency and connection are both critical for a well functioning government. I plan on connecting with my constituents as much as possible, and I strongly encourage students to reach out to me with any questions, comments or concerns they may have. In addition, I would like to consider some sort of biweekly or monthly office hours, where students can receive updates and express their concerns to me directly.","I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I have the experience and passion necessary to improve trust and communication in the senate. I have been very disappointed at the level of dysfunction seen in the senate, and as a newcomer, I believe that I can help the senate move past these controversies and towards a better, more inclusive future.",Left-leaning,"Fair, Despite the chaos that consumed the senate for much of Fall and Winter quarter, I do believe that the current senate has done a fair job at addressing the needs and concerns of the student body. Especially now that the senate is fully up and running, I hope and expect to see more student-focused legislation passing in the next few months.","Yes, words): As a public university, I do not believe that UCSB should be investing student money into corporations supporting conflict or violence in any form. I'm especially concerned with UCSB’s investments into military contractors such as Lockheed Martin, which I have serious moral and ethical concerns about.","Yes, I believe that all forms of public higher education, including UCSB, should be free. That being said, I recognize that this is a long term goal, and is unlikely to happen in the near future. But if elected in A.S., I would certainly be interested in exploring legislation to help increase student financial literacy and make UCSB more affordable for students and families.","While I appreciate UCSB’s efforts to improve the quality and availability of mental health services, I still think there is significantly more work needed. Specifically, I would like to see UCSB be more preventative by addressing the root causes of stress and mental illness. Often, it seems like university administrators are not willing to consider their own impact on the mental wellbeing of their students. By continually increasing enrollment and not building enough housing to accommodate the new influx of students, UCSB administrators have helped create a vicious housing shortage that forces many students into unsafe or dangerous living conditions, if students are able to find housing at all. This obviously has devastating impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of students, and has even forced many students into pausing or permanently suspending their education. Without proactive action on housing and accommodation, administrators are continuing to fuel the mental health crisis by sacrificing the health and wellbeing of their most vulnerable students.","While I do not have any personal experience with the Title IX office, I know that the office provides important support, services and resources to survivors of sexual assault. I believe that is it absoluely crucial that the survivors of sexual assault recieve the support and assitance that they deserve, and as a senator, I promise to always listen to and center the voices of survivors and advocates. I also hope to see the university invest significantly more time, money and resources into further education and prevention measures.","Quite frankly, I think UCSB has a lot of work to do on increasing representation and equity on campus. Especially in matters related to housing, the university has been extremely negligent in addressing the needs of all students from historically underrepresented groups. The extreme shortage and high cost of housing also especially impacts those from historically underrepresented groups, many of whom come from families that have been denied the ability to build long-term generational wealth or cannot afford to pay thousands of additional dollars a month for housing and university costs. In addition, UCSB has a serious issue with far-right rhetoric on campus. Within Winter Quarter alone, there was a series of very severe and disgusting incidences on campus and in Isla Vista, including the papering of antisemitic fliers across IV and the appearance of racist and anti-trans personality Charlie Kirk, who’s arrival brought hundreds of far-right participants to UCSB’s campus. These incidents, among many others, have undoubtedly shaken student’s trust in the university’s ability to provide a space environment for all students. By not addressing the rampant rise of hate speech on campus, the administration is refusing to serve and listen to their students.",[NO ANSWER],[NO ANSWER],"As I was not serving as a senator during this time, I do not feel comfortable answering this question. However, I will say the entire situation was extremely unfortunate, and I sincerely hope that there is not a repeat of this situation in the future.",[NO ANSWER],
Alvin Wang,Sindhu,Engineering Collegiate Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23131419/Alvin_Wang.jpg,,He/Him,First-year,computer science,,,"Coming into this questionnaire with lots of love for UCSB and its student population, there are
many reasons behind my candidacy for COE Senator. However, I am primarily running to be
senator because:
1. I believe that my experience, drive, and grasp of the interests of my fellow engineers make
me the best fit for the position,
2. I hope to provide desperately needed representation and transparency for COE,
3. I aspire to constantly challenge myself in this position, experience perspectives from some of
the brightest students at UCSB, and have exciting, insightful conversations with as many
students as possible,
4. Most importantly, senators have the potential to do substantial good, and I wish to enact
ground-shaking, positive change during my time here at UCSB!"," Let’s start from the beginning! I began my student leadership journey as an eager, excited
Pearman Fellow for the AS Office of the Attorney General. While my term as a fellow lasted
only two quarters, my first experience with Associated Students inspired me to delve deeper
into activism and student government. This eventually led to my positions as a Caseworker for
the Office of the Attorney General and the Treasurer of the COE Engineering Student Council.
I believe that the largest indicator of a COE Senator’s success is their prior experience in both
AS and leadership in an engineering organization. Both my Caseworker and Treasurer positions
have given me deep insight into the function of Associated Students, ASUCSB Legal Code,
and what the everyday UCSB Engineer might need to achieve success. These skills will be
integral and invaluable to me when I begin writing and executing legislation as a senator and
serve on the Engineering Student Council as their Senate liaison.","Reiterating my point that senators have the potential to do substantial good, four
resolutions/bills that I’d like to introduce while in office are:
1. Resolution to urge Academic Senate to create an investigative task force on impacted course
offerings
- The consequences of course offering scarcity falls disproportionately on underclassmen
while forcing upperclassmen to potentially require additional quarters to graduate.

- The goal of the taskforce is to investigate how the administration is handling the issues
of over enrollment and course scarcity and hold them accountable.
2. Bill to clarify and legitimize the implied power of the ASUCSB President to issue Executive
Orders
- There is currently no mention of executive orders in the 2022-2023 edition of AS Legal
Code.
- There is precedent for AS presidents issuing EO’s to solve crises.
- Clarifying the EO procedure improves accountability against EO abuse.
3. Resolution to urge Academic Senate to push back (P/NP) deadline
- Many COE students have graduate school aspirations.
- Pushing back the (P/NP) deadline would give students the greatest flexibility to choose
their grading option and ensure a competitive GPA.
4. Bill to clarify and update Judicial Council powers
- Senate’s failure to convene for the majority of Fall quarter indicates an issue with legal
code and the role of the Judicial Council.
The proposition for the Judicial Council to have judicial review (investigating the
constitutionality of legislative/executive act) should be extensively discussed and
considered to hold AS elected officials and Senate accountable.","My top priorities while in office are to enrich the academic experience, empower and uplift
student voices, and encourage discourse and solidarity on DEI issues.
In terms of enriching the academic experience, currently, academic opportunities are entirely
dependent on the initiative of the individual. However, this makes these opportunities
inaccessible to students who are simply unaware or fall short of stringent requirements. I hope
to streamline the process of communicating with professors to increase research accessibility
and partner with campus organizations to create greater internship resources.

The current AS system sees a disconnect between Senate and the student body. The first step to
empowering and uplifting student voices is to have full transparency between both entities,
allowing everyday students to be aware of and form their own judgments on Senate actions.
Assuming the first step is true, the next course of action is to allow for easy pathways of
communication between students, Senate, and administration. As COE Senator, I will work to
facilitate complete transparency between Senate and the student body and provide easy access
to those in power.
There are currently efforts by administration and other entities to promote DEI and belonging.
However, many of these efforts are performative and fail to create positive impact. Taking a
step in the right direction, I believe that mandatory diversity awareness and
anti-racism/anti-bias training for all faculty and student leaders is a must. In addition, student
organizations and clubs serve as communities of passion and belonging at UCSB, allowing
students to feel included. If elected, I will work to provide greater access to resources and
increase support for these organizations.","Enriching academic experience:
1. Engineering Student Council - expanding ESC and improving upon their Engineering
Club Grant Program and Merit Scholarship Program
2. AS Academic Senate - increase impacted course offerings and push back (P/NP)
deadline
3. Administration - investigating where our tuition is going to divert resources more
equitably and evenly
4. Administration/Professors - increase internship/research opportunities through creating
stronger forms of communication between students and faculty
Empower and uplift student voices:
1. AS Senate/Daily Nexus - Promoting full transparency between Senate and students
2. Administration - Create a more streamlined process for voicing student concerns
Encourage discourse and solidarity on DEI issues:

1. AS Office of the IVP/Administration - Mandating diversity
awareness+anti-racism/anti-bias trainings for all faculty and student leaders
2. AS Senate - increasing accessibility to resources and support to clubs that promote
belonging","Holding office hours and making my social media and email readily accessible are a given.
However, few students will take full advantage of these mediums to voice their concerns. It’s
not enough to wait for students to come to me. I will proactively reach out to AS Boards
Committees and Units as well as student organizations and attend their meetings in person to
ask exactly what they need and what I can do to help.","Reiterating my response to Question 1, I believe that my experience, drive, and grasp of the
interests of my fellow engineers make me the best candidate for this position. Both my unique
experiences as Caseworker of the Office of the Attorney General and Treasurer for COE
Engineering Student Council have developed my understanding of the scope and function of
AS Senate and prepared me to best serve the College of Engineering as a student leader and an
approachable, everyday engineer.",Left-leaning,"Poor. I see the immense effort that the 73rd A.S. Senate puts in to provide for the UCSB Student
body. However, this response addresses Senate’s impact holistically.
Failing to convene for the majority of Fall quarter, the A.S. Senate is currently more
disconnected from the student body than ever before. With little publicity and transparency, the
average, everyday student has little understanding of or investment in the function of Senate.
However, I am eager and optimistic about addressing and eliminating these issues with the 74th
A.S. Senate.","Yes. For full transparency and honesty, I have little background in terms of AS involvement with
companies that profit from human rights violations. However, if true, I will be the first to
propose this resolution. All forms of human rights violations are absolutely unacceptable and
should not be condoned.","No. Currently, tuition and student fees make up the majority of UCSB university funding. It boils
down to the simple issue of scarcity. UCSB simply doesn’t receive enough from the state, and a
future with UCSB being tuition-free is unsustainable and has severe consequences. Forcing
UCSB to be tuition-free would increase the tax burden on in-state residents, which falls
disproportionately on middle-class and low-income families. While I disagree that UCSB
should be tuition-free, at a minimum, I believe that UCSB should be AFFORDABLE for all
students.","One of the key services we have here at UCSB is CAPS (Counseling & Psychological Service),
which provides services ranging from therapy to short-term counseling. CAPS, like many other
mental health services, is funded by student fees. I believe that to increase the effectiveness and
accessibility of services like CAPS, there should be a more equitable and even distribution of
student fees for underfunded mental health services. This would mean paying counselors and
therapists a more competitive wage and increasing accessibility to long-term, in-person, quality
care.","I am familiar with the UCSB Title IX office and understand its role in eliminating sex-based
discrimination and investigating sexual harassment reports. However, the purpose of Title IX is

more to proactively ensure a safe work and academic environment and hold perpetrators
accountable than to support survivors with empathetic, quality care. Instead, I believe that there
should be an expansion of CARE, allowing CARE to provide guaranteed 24/7 accessibility to
quality services."," I believe that UCSB can do better at serving historically underrepresented groups. Each student
comes from a unique background and carries a unique perspective. However, many find
inclusion and belonging in campus organizations. If elected, I hope to be able to provide more
resources for these organizations and enrich the academic experience of all students.
Furthermore, historically, few members from historically underrepresented groups serve on
administrative boards and in student leadership positions. I aspire to brainstorm with my fellow
colleagues and administration to develop more effective forms of community outreach and
stakeholder engagement to take us one step closer to a truly representative, equitable UCSB.","This question is actually relevant to the current project I am working on in the Office of the
Attorney General. As a co-author of the current Executive Order Bill working its way through
AS Senate, the first bill that I would like to propose would be one that clarifies the implied
power of the AS President to issue Executive Orders and raises potential concerns for the
consequences of such a bill becoming part of AS Legal Code.","Involving the student body and keeping them informed comes down to using the various
mediums of communication to reach them. As a senator, I hope to work with Engineering
Student Council to create a newsletter that provides insight into the actions of ESC and the
projects that I would be working on. This newsletter would be sent to all COE students through
administration on a monthly basis. Furthermore, expanding AS Senate’s social media presence
through relevant, frequent posts is a must to bridge the gap between A.S. and the average
student.","For context, according to AS Legal Code, Senate cannot be convened unless the Internal Vice
President calls for a meeting, which essentially led to AS as an organization being in gridlock
for Fall Quarter. As a senator in this situation, I would have first reached out to the IVP to
understand their circumstances and see if it would be possible to convene Senate. Otherwise, I
would reach out to the Office of the Attorney General to develop a better understanding of the
procedure that AS Legal Code deems appropriate for this situation. If all else fails, I would
reach out to fellow elected officials and AS Judicial Council to begin the recall election
procedure and elect a new IVP.
This year, the gridlock in the Senate and the reluctance of current senators to go through the
recall process forced President Pabla to issue an Executive Order to replace the IVP with an
interim IVP. I believe that Senate’s failure to begin a recall petition is unacceptable and
prolonged a trivial issue solvable by Week 3 of Fall Quarter.","I see executive orders as a necessary power for the Chief Executive Officer of any organization,
including UCSB Associated Students. Time and time again, executive orders have saved the
organization from the brink of collapse. However, the ease with which the AS President can
enact change using this power necessitates strict guidelines. Executive orders should only be
used in times of crisis in accordance with AS Legal Code and should be explicitly written in the
AS Constitution.","My strategy for preventing a backup with employee honoraria would be to change the
methods it can be approved of. Having a single method of approval just does not work in
this complicated day and age. Outlining in the constitution ways to approve honoraria
when the senate is unable to be called to order would prevent a situation like this from
occurring again. I believe that many of the important processes should have a
workaround after seeing what happens when the Senate goes nuclear. The entire system
should not be able to be thrown to a halt by a single person or even the small number of
people who serve in the Senate. As a senator, I will work to put these types of
constitutional amendments on the ballot for students to vote for, because it should be the
students who say how their government works. Some students count on their employee
honoraria to survive, and when the system fails them because of internal turmoil, it
becomes too politicized. I am a political science major. I understand that politics is
cutthroat and harsh, but that does not mean we need to force people to suffer because of
it. When I am a senator, I will leave my personal qualms out of it and work to serve the
people."
Caleb Hanson,Sindhu,Off-Campus Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23131437/Caleb_Hanson.jpg,,He/Him,First-year,Economics and political science double major,,,"I am running to be an off-campus senator to both improve the school and expand access to
necessary services on and off campus. As many of you know, important services such as CAPS,
CARE, tenant's rights services, and so many more are often overbooked and constantly
unavailable when students are in need of their assistance. I also have more than adequate
experience when it comes to student government, serving in some capacity from high school to
the current day. I believe this great school can soar above our greatest expectations under the

proper leadership and student government. I will work tirelessly to leave this school in a better
place than before I was elected, assuring the school is providing possibly life-saving services to
the students that pay thousands of dollars a year to attend. The final reason I am running is to
represent the students that live in isla vista. I will act as a voice that listens to the concerns of
those I represent and turn those concerns into bills that address the issues. I am ready to serve
the students of Isla Vista, and if elected, I will do everything I can to fix the problems students
in Isla Vista face every day.","Since starting at UCSB in the fall of 2022, I have been a part of UCSB’s Resident housing
association (RHA) as the representative at large for Santa Catalina South Tower. At the
beginning of the fall quarter, I was elected to represent my dorm (Santa Catalina) at the weekly
RHA Coordinating Board meeting. At these meetings, we would be presented with funding and
flyering requests to debate on and approve if they were in the best interests of the residents it
would be serving. Another responsibility of my position was planning events for the residents
to attend. I planned events aimed at helping residents deal with their stress, giving students
opportunities to snack and study with each other, and I am currently planning a major pride
event towards the end of the spring semester to give members of the LGBTQ+ community and
allies a fun event to celebrate pride with each other. I have worked hard over the past few
quarters to ensure residents' RHA activity fee is used to benefit them in the best way possible.
If elected as an Off-Campus Senator, I will continue to work to represent my constituents as I
have done my entire time as a part of the RHA.","I have numerous ideas for different bills or resolutions to introduce if I am elected, on top of
resolutions that members of my constituency would like me to introduce. The first bill that
comes to mind that I would like to introduce is an emergency temporary relocation bill. This
bill would set a plan and resources for students displaced throughout the year due to natural
disasters. It is no secret the current state of the cliffs in IV are deteriorating. It feels too often
that we see a post about a house on DP having part of its patio fall off into the ocean. We need
to be ready if students lose their houses due to erosion. The next bill I would introduce would
be to expand access to resources needed to protect tenants’ rights because it is all too common
for us young renters to be taken advantage of by leasing companies. The final bill I would like
to introduce would be to expand mental health resources such as CAPS and CARE because if
the school isn't providing adequate resources to help and protect its students, it is failing them. I
would continue introducing bills focused on ensuring students have the resources they need to
focus on their education.","My platform is based on assuring that the students of UCSB have the resources they need to
succeed and limit having to worry about basic needs. This includes making sure that everyone
has adequate access to mental health resources, food, and legal resources. If the school isn't
working to provide students who pay thousands of dollars in tuition each year with every
resource they need to finish their education, it is failing them. This is why I will work tirelessly
while I am in office, working with both internal and external groups associated with the school
to ensure that students are being taken care of. These organizations will include CAPS, CARE,
the AS food bank, the Pardall Center, and the Isla Vista Tenants Union, to name a few. I will
also work to pass legislation that works to fund these resources to an extent where they are
available and capable of helping all students who attend UCSB. A school will fail without the
proper means of supporting the student body. That is why the school needs to stand behind its
student body in all possible ways because when the students of UCSB succeed, so does the
school as a whole.","As I mentioned above, I plan on working with many different organizations to achieve the
platform I have laid out for myself. For mental health, I intend to work with CAPS, CARE, and
UCSB student health to ensure that our students have all the resources they need to care about
their education while still caring for themselves. For food security services, I will contact the
AS food bank and local stores in Isla Vista to ensure students can worry about their midterms
instead of worrying if they will be able to eat this week. The third set of organizations I intend
on working with are the ones that protect residents from landlords trying to pull a fast one on
young renters. I would work with the Pardall Center and the Isla Vista Tenants Association to
ensure they have the resources to provide tenants living in Isla Vista with the resources they
need to be successful renters. There are many other vital organizations that work as the
lifeblood of the UCSB student body. While I only name-dropped a couple in this response,
there are countless others that I intend to work with. I will work to assure that any resource that
can help students is available to all.","As part of my goal to be as transparent and accessible to all of my constituents as possible,
I will hold office hours each week that will be accessible both in person and online over
Zoom. I will publicly post the hours I will be available, making sure that anyone who
would like to get involved with school politics will be able to through me. I also intend to
have a system in which students will be able to leave comments or grievances that they
have with the current functions of AS. I hope this will garner more informal but important

feedback about the current view on the Senate's work. My final strategy for making myself
available to the student body is to create a social media platform where I can receive
feedback in a very informal way. This could be either message to the account, polls on a
story to gauge the student body's views or numerous other ways I could reach my
constituency. In an effort to demystify the workings of the UCSB AS senate, I will use my
platform to inform students about the current state of legislation and different ways that
they can get involved with the important issues.","Why am I the best candidate for this position? I believe that I am the best candidate because I
have devoted myself since I was 16 to serving the public in elected positions. From high school
all the way to now, I have held roles that involved me actively working to improve my
constituents' issues. I have the experience that is needed for this role and will work every day
once I am in the role to prove to my constituents that they made the right decision. I will work
tirelessly to write and pass legislation to better the school I call home. I am also currently
studying both economics and political science, which will have benefits both when it comes to
writing legislation, but also when it comes to funding programs and lowering the burden of
tuition on students. I will use the information I have gained over the years, on top of gathering
new information from my constituents about their needs to act as the best candidate and best
senator for them. I also believe that I have a unique perspective on campus issues from being a
part of the RHA. I got to see firsthand the issues that clubs and organizations had to deal with
on the daily. I will use this information to pass legislation that will benefit the UCSB
community as a whole.",Left-leaning,"Fair. I believe that the A.S. Senate this year has not necessarily
done a poor job, but it has been a boilerplate session in which nothing noteworthy changed.","Yes. I don't think that UCSB, a public government university,
should do any sort of business with a company that even just allegedly profits from human
rights violations","No. While I do believe that the current tuition is
ridiculous and understand that aid can only help so much, I do not believe
going completely tuition-free would be successful. Instead, I would tear the
current system to the ground and rebuild it to make college accessible to all.","I do not believe that the current mental health services are adequate for the UCSB student
body. Anyone who has ever tried to get an appointment at CAPS will tell you about the long
wait and seemingly impossible time they have scheduling an appointment. And then, after

they finally do, being able to find someone to consistently meet is a whole different
challenge. It's not the people who work at CAPS fault, they are doing the best they can with
the limited resources that they are given. That is why the main way to address this problem is
to allocate a bigger budget to mental health resources. Without them, our students cannot
thrive, which is why they need to be of such a high level of importance. By giving the mental
health services the resources they need instead of forcing them to work on what seems to be a
never-ending deficit, we will ensure the students' mental health is in good hands that can take
the time to fully engage with and help them through their troubles. I believe this is the only
way to truly bring our campus’ mental health services up to a satisfactory level for all
students.","I am familiar with the Title IX office and its function. Through my current elected position I am
registered as a mandated reporter, which has given me a pretty good understanding of the
functions of the Title IX office. I believe that one way the university could better support the
survivors of sexual assault is to better fund our mental health resources. I know I am beginning
to sound like a broken record but improved mental health outlets would benefit almost every
part of our school community. By expanding these resources to the students who need them and
would benefit from them, we could not only be there for our students but possibly save their
lives in the process. Along with expanding our mental health resources, I also believe that the
school would benefit from a campaign to spread not only awareness but also information about
how to support other students who are survivors struggling for support. In addition, removing
barriers that make it feel impossible for a survivor of sexual assault to come forward with their
stories and allow them to use the resources available is also key in supporting our students. No
student should have to be afraid to seek help at this university.","Here’s the thing with UCSB serving the underrepresented and my experience with it. As a
member of the LGBTQ+ community, I often think about this, and here is the conclusion I have
come to. The university tries to serve these communities, and you can tell, but it just doesn't
always come out right. It's kinda like being misgendered in public with your grandpa that
means well. His response being “He uses they/them pronouns”. They mean well, and you
appreciate the effort but there is definitely a lot of room for improvement. The entire SRB
serves students with essentially any resource center they may need with employees that
understand what the students are going through. I believe at this point in time, the best thing
that we can do is better fund the resource centers. With a larger staff and more resources,

students from historically underrepresented groups will have a place where they can feel safe
and supported. Another thing that could help these underrepresented communities is funding
events that promote inclusion and allows others to experience some of these communities'
traditions and culture. By doing this, we would further understand each other in possibly new
and unfamiliar ways, and promote inclusivity throughout our school.","The first bill that I would introduce would be the emergency temporary relocation bill. This bill
would focus on putting a plan in place as well as resources for students who lose their current
residence from things like natural disasters or cliffs falling on ocean-side DP. This bill would
also provide resources for temporary housing for people who have suffered from various kinds
of assault from their roommates or housemates. This program would also provide resources for
finding more permanent housing once they have been safely relocated. This program would
provide an essential service, especially for a city like DP, where we literally have houses slowly
but surely falling into the ocean. We need more programs and bills that benefit and work to
protect the students who are living off campus, which is a majority of our student population.
This bill would directly target one of the major fears that a lot of students have to deal with
when living in Isla Vista. It gives students another layer of protection when renting a house,
especially when renting companies in Isla Vista are known to be poor at serving their residents.
This would be the first of many important bills I will introduce to give students the necessary
resources.","There are multiple steps I intend to take that would demystify the entity that is A.S. The first of
these would be to grow a social media platform where I would be able to keep people informed
on the current status of the A.S. Senate. From this social media platform, I would provide
places for students to comment on current legislation, vocalize grievances, and possibly even
give their opinions via a poll posted on the account. I feel like we need to treat social media as
an asset in this day and age rather than act as though it is the enemy. By utilizing it as a tool, we
can reach a much larger portion of the base than possible with other tools. My second strategy
to increase involvement with A.S. is holding office hours in accessible ways and at accessible
times for students. One of the biggest problems with current office hours is that unless you
know about A.S., I would want office hours for all senators posted in a public place so that
students could much more easily contact their representatives. It is important that senators
remember who they are serving, and that is only made easier when students know how to
contact them.","Obviously, at that point in time, I was not a senator yet, so it is hard to say exactly how I
would’ve handled the situation had I been serving. If I had been a senator at this time, I
believe I would have worked to ensure that the Senate never got to the point where it was
forced to halt its operations for almost two months. I believe compassion and
understanding are rare but important in politics and that they need to be reintroduced
into all forms of politics. That being said, if the Senate were not being called to order, I
would first find ways to get mandatory issues dealt with even if the Senate wouldn’t meet.
I then would have attempted to find a way to possibly work things out between opposing
parties to reach a compromise. This way, the Senate could hold its integrity while
mitigating the problems at hand. I am running on a platform of serving the students'
needs and problem-solving, I will work as a senator that will go to those who I might
disagree with and work out a compromise so that both sides can leave happy and the
student body flourishes with a united body.","The separation of powers is always difficult to discuss because constitutions often leave
the powers vague and even overlapping in some parts. I believe that executive orders play
a key role in A.S. because, logistically, not everything can be legislated. It would take too
long and would end up not serving the students as much as it should. However, when an
executive order is used to override actions by a different body of government, that is
when it becomes questionable. Personally, I believe that the A.S. President did her job by
removing the IVP. The president's job is to keep the government running, even during
times of crisis. Gurleen did this when she removed the IVP, and it was in her right to do
so from the constitution. The most important aspect of this is to have a healthy and
impartial judiciary in place that would prevent any executive from abusing their powers.
So I guess to sum it all up, yes, I do believe that executive orders do have a place in
student government and that they play a key role in the day-to-day running of the
government. That being said, there needs proper oversight when it comes to executive
power because unchecked power leaves everything a little too messy.",
Daniel Fourchy,Holly,Letters & Science Collegiate Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23131447/Daniel-Fourchy-2083.jpg,,He/Him,First-year,Political Science and Economics,,,"To put it simply, I am running to be a senator so I can make UCSB a better place for its students. There are many things I see in my day to day life on the UCSB campus that could be improved on which would allow UCSB students to have a more enjoyable academic experience. With this being said, too often I complain about our campus even though I am not actively working to fix the problems myself. I don’t have any right to complain if I don’t try and bring about the changes I want; which is why when I heard about the Associated Students Senate, I knew I had to run. I see the senate as a way for me to stop complaining and start
acting. I have innovative ideas that will make a positive difference in the lives of students on our campus – all I need is a chance. A chance to be your College of Letters and Science Senator.","I believe that I am uniquely prepared to be a senator because of both my academic and social
experiences. In regards to my academic life, I am double majoring in political science and
economics. This takes up a decent amount of my day to day life and requires me to be a hard
worker. Not only will my work ethic allow me to get more done in the senate, but my
experience in the political science major will allow me to more efficiently navigate the political
world of the senate. The political science classes I have taken at UCSB have taught me how
politics work and how to best get policies passed. This knowledge will allow me to be a better
senator as I will be able to put more policy in place than I otherwise would be able to. As far as
my social experience, I consider myself an outgoing person who is able to easily make friends
with others. Because cooperation goes hand-in-hand with friendship, the relationships I form
with other senators will enable me to work more effectively with them, getting more policy put
into place.","The first bill I’d like to introduce while in office is a budget proposal that would allocate a
certain amount of the budget to a fund dedicated to helping students with the costs that
come with taking classes at UCSB. By this I mean textbook costs, costs for online
services (such as Top Hat), and even costs for simple school supplies. This fund would be
primarily used for lower income students who wouldn’t be able to afford these costs
otherwise.
Another bill I’d like to introduce while in office is one that would create a system in
which normal students can propose their own bills and resolutions. It would still be up to
the elected senators to decide whether to implement these proposals, but the insight and
feedback from the students these senators represent would allow the senate to work more
efficiently while also giving everyday students a voice.
The last bill I’d like to introduce is a petition for the GoGaucho app to be revived. This
app (back when it worked), was able to provide an interactive map of our campus,
updated dining hall menus, and an updated schedule for a particular student. It made
navigating daily life at UCSB a breeze which is why it should be reinstated immediately.","My platform revolves around keeping the people I represent happy. As a senator elected by the
UCSB student body, it is up to me to implement the changes to our campus that the student
body would like to see. I am sick and tired of senators who are only in it for themselves and do
nothing to address their constituents' needs. This is why if I am elected senator I vow to be both
proactive and reactive in regards to my constituents needs. Proactive by anticipating the
policies that students will want implemented and reactive by responding to rapid changes in
student’s preferences. This will enable me to best serve the students I represent, which is the
only thing I truly care about.","In order to achieve my above mentioned platform, I plan to mainly utilize the clubs,
organizations, and groups that are made up of UCSB students. I think it is crucial to solely
work with the people who are actually affected by the policy that would be put in place (in this
case UCSB students). By reaching out to students I can gain unique perspectives on the
changes that they want to see in our campus, allowing me to implement policy that can
positively impact more students at UCSB. Interactions with these student-led groups could be
as simple as letting them know that I am a senator and am there if they need anything or as
complicated as working with one of these groups to implement a specific policy on the UCSB
campus.","Because my platform is entirely based on me reacting to what UCSB students want, I will be
making myself super available to my constituents in order to stay updated on student’s
preferences. I would like to host some sort of weekly session where students can come and
essentially share their thoughts on an aspect of UCSB they’d like to see changed. This would
provide me with new ideas on policy that could be implemented. In regards to direct
communication from students; I will respond to all emails from students in a timely manner
and if a student would like to meet to talk in more detail about something then I’ll be happy
to do that. I’d also be perfectly happy with doing a zoom meeting if that is preferred by the
student.","I am the best candidate for this position because I truly care about it. This may not seem like
much, but as shown by the current senate, this seems to be a rare quality. Too many members of
A.S. see the senate as nothing more than a blip to put on their future resume. This is not the
case for me. I have been passionate about politics my whole life and served in student
government at my high school for multiple years. I see the senate as a way for me to live out
this passion while also making UCSB a better place for both you and me. It is time for new
blood to enter the A.S. Senate. It is time for UCSB to become the best version of itself.",(c) Centrist,"(f) Very poor, The 74th A.S. Senate was impressive in its ineptitude.
The student body was abandoned by its representatives with none of its needs addressed in any
way, shape, or form.",(a) Yes,"(b) No
I believe that UCSB should have a tuition system
similar to the one it currently does. That is, students who are low income and
can’t afford college should be given either free or reduced tuition, while
students who are higher income should have to pay normal tuition. Essentially,
it would work on a scale, with a lower income meaning a smaller tuition and a
higher income meaning a higher tuition.","Overall, I’d say that UCSB does a pretty good job when it comes to mental health services.
There exists a whole building on campus essentially dedicated to student mental health that
provides services such as therapy and counseling, which is a major plus. Where I think UCSB
could do better is on outreach. Oftentimes those suffering from mental health issues don’t want
to talk about them or aren’t able to get the help they need. UCSB should focus on trying to
reach these students as these are often the students who need it the most. It wouldn’t even be all
that difficult because the infrastructure to deal with the influx of students is already in place.","I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and the important function it serves. When it
comes to survivors of sexual assault, the University should implement a Sexual Assault
Survivor Bill of Rights. This bill, which has been passed in other parts of America, would
guarantee certain rights to the survivors of sexual assault. These rights would include the right
to informative rape kit procedures and notification, the right to terminate all legal ties with the
assailant, and others. This bill would ensure that survivors of sexual assault would be treated
fairly by UCSB, giving them equality under the law.","I do think UCSB is effectively serving historically underrepresented groups. Whether it is the
multicultural center or the increasingly diverse student body, I think that UCSB does a pretty

good job. Besides this, UCSB has done a great job in regards to tolerance of all sorts of
viewpoints on its campus. It has allowed various groups to come to campus, even some that the
majority of the student body disagrees with, as just because someone disagrees with someone
doesn’t mean they don’t have a right to talk.","The first bill I’d like to introduce while in office is a budget proposal that would allocate a
certain amount of the budget to a fund dedicated to helping students with the costs that come
with taking classes at UCSB. By this I mean textbook costs, costs for online services (such as
Top Hat), and even costs for simple school supplies. This fund would be primarily used for
lower income students who wouldn’t be able to afford these costs otherwise. This fund would
allow students to take the classes they want to take, not only the classes they can afford.",NO ANSWER,"Quite simply, the 2022-23 A.S. Senate seemed to be missing any sort of leadership. If I was a
senator during the situation last year, I would have taken charge and worked to address the
allegations against us. Furthermore, if any of these allegations were proven to be true then I
would have taken the steps necessary. If this meant removing those from the senate who
weren’t doing their job, then so be it. If this meant combing through our financials for the last
decade trying to figure out where it went wrong, then so be it. Essentially I would have done
whatever it took to solve the crisis and get the senate back to doing what it's supposed to do:
make laws.","I would say executive orders exist for situations just like the one described above. While in an
ideal world the A.S. government would only get things done through group consensus, in times
when the group is failing to do its job it is then the job of the president to take control (as she
did). However, if this executive power starts to be abused and used in situations where it is
obvious personal gain was the motivator, then this power must be revoked. This is why it is
important to elect a president you trust, as a surprising amount can be done through executive
order.","For additional context, Senate is where honoraria (payments for AS employees) are approved.
With the former IVP on strike and Senate unable to convene, the process of AS employees
receiving honoraria was stalled. As a senator, I will introduce a bill to create a procedure to
allow for alternative methods for Senate to convene in the event that the IVP refuses to
convene Senate. This bill would replace the IVP with the First Senate President Pro-Tempore
given that Senate has failed to convene for a certain number of weeks. In the event that both the
First and Second President Pro-Tempore have not been appointed, the responsibility of
appointing a succeeding IVP would fall upon the AS President. This will ensure that Senate
will convene and honoraria applicants will receive their subsidies."

change within our institution. I am confident that my passion for advocacy and commitment to
representing the needs and interests of all students will inevitably drive my efforts to maximize
positive change at UCSB. As a first-generation student who struggled to acclimate herself to this
campus, I recognize that there are systemic barriers that inhibit individuals from fully thriving at
our university. It is critical to acknowledge the unique challenges that students face within our
campus, whether that be in the context of mental health, financial needs, food insecurity, or lack
of housing. There are ample resources available that many students don’t take advantage of
simply because they don’t know about them. With that being said, I want to increase awareness
of campus resources as well as develop initiatives to further fund causes that will represent the
needs of the student body. I seek to use this platform to advocate for policies and initiatives that
tackle the prominent issues plaguing our campus, as well as provide a means through which we
can alleviate these challenges together.","Currently, I am in the Civic Engagement Scholars Program led by Assistant Vice Chancellor and
Dean of Student Life, Katya Armistead, as well as Director of Civic and Community
Engagement, Viviana Marsano. This program has placed an emphasis on the theoretical
framework and historical background of civic engagement within our institution. Within this
program, my peers and I have engaged in leadership development that has reinforced our civic
engagement as well as developed our skills for deliberative discourse. The training I have
recieved in deliberative discourse and the ability to have civil conversations on controversial
topics will undoubtedly aid me in effectively communicating with constituents and other student
leaders, even in circumstances where opinions may differ. With this experience, I am confident
that I will be able to promote a more inclusive, positive environment at UCSB whilst advocating
for fundamental changes that parallel these virtues.","Throughout my time here at UCSB, it has become evident that UCSB administration continues
to undermine student needs in various contexts. It is no secret that our university falls short in
providing the student body with the support and resources necessary to their academic success
and wellbeing. The current academic and health resources in place are not enough to
accommodate the influx of students at our university. To counter this, I plan on proposing
resolutions that expand mental health services on campus in order to adequately support the
needs of every unique student. Additionally, our Counseling and Psychological Services do not
offer long-term counseling; this is an issue I am committed to addressing. Furthermore, I believe
we should allocate additional funding toward emergency crisis services to alleviate the burden of
students who face extraneous circumstances that inhibit their potential to succeed in all aspects.
The housing crisis in Isla Vista serves as a useful lens in which we can diagnose the necessary
measures needed to assist students. The extreme cost of living in Santa Barbara further
financially burdens all students, but especially those from low-income backgrounds. For these
reasons, I believe that it is necessary to also propose resolutions that offer increased financial aid
to individuals from low-income households. The financial burden of simply attending this
university needs to be addressed and countered with methods to alleviate these concerns.
Moreover, it is critical to address the needs of our Hispanic/Latinx students to uphold the virtues
of our HSI status. Despite the fact that UCSB holds the title of “Hispanic Serving Institution,”
this university has failed to effectively cater resources and support this demographic of students
to the extent that it should. For this reason, I am committed to voicing my concerns about our
HSI status and using this position to deliver student grievances to the campus administration. I

hope to use this position to be a voice for my underrepresented peers and develop programs and
initiatives that expand support for the entirety of the student body.","Ultimately, I aim to effectively represent the needs of every unique student at UCSB, especially
those from marginalized backgrounds who may face systemic barriers to accessing resources and
opportunities. I am committed to addressing the challenges of our university head-on, and acting
promptly when concerns are voiced. It is imperative that Associated Students, especially the
Senate, maintain open lines of communication and discourse among students and student
government in order to facilitate an effective exchange of information. Additionally,
transparency between administration and students is necessary to uphold the democratic tenets of
our student body. My priority is voicing the concerns of my students and mitigating campus
issues. In an effort to better the university’s climate, I will work toward increasing access to
mental health resources, increasing financial aid options, and allocating more funds that can be
utilized by the student body in times of need. By collaborating with campus organizations as
well as fellow senators, these initiatives to catalyze incremental change at UCSB will be a
priority. Most importantly, listening to the overall concerns of the student body is imperative to
the success of this upcoming Senate in passing functional legislation that embodies the needs of
the student body.","In order to achieve the aforementioned platforms, I would like to work with EOP in an effort to
increase funding for their EOP grants to maximize student success and enhance the academic
journey of disadvantaged students. In addition to this, I would like to collaborate with the
Financial Crisis Response Team, the Food Security & Basic Needs Task Force, as well as
campus organizations that seek to voice their concerns and needs.","During this upcoming academic year, I will prioritize my availability to constituents by offering
both remote and in-person office hours. I will ensure that communication is fluid and responses
are promptly given. My email will be available to students who seek to voice their interests or
concerns, and I will ensure that their voices are heard.","Throughout my time here, I have heard the concerns of many of my peers regarding the lack of
campus resources and administration transparency. UCSB has failed its student body in several
ways, and equipping this upcoming senate with passionate individuals committed to
implementing fundamental change is necessary now more than ever. As a first generation student
from a low income household, I can testify to my experiences as well in regards to the barriers
that many students like me have faced. My experiences throughout my three years at UCSB have
ignited a strong desire to advocate for my community and accurately represent the needs of the
entire student body. I am confident that my passion to promote a more inclusive and supportive
environment for my community will translate into this senatorial position.",Left-leaning,"Good: The prior Senate did their best to address the needs of the student body. However, due to
the allegations of negligence and discrimination, I believe that the Associated Students entity
was met with a challenge that ultimately halted their duties for an extended period of time.
Nonetheless, I commend the passion and efforts given by the senators during these periods of
uncertainty.","No. I am not well-informed enough on this topic to take a concrete stance on this issue. It is
critical that UCSB as an entity avoids resolutions that may further promote anti-semitism and
bigotry on campus. The harsh reality is that our student-led university government does not hold
the political power nor legitimacy to solve Middle Eastern conflicts at this capacity. Nonetheless,
this is an issue that should be addressed with the student body before passing university
legislation on.","No: In an ideal world, higher education would be free and accessible to all who wished to pursue
it. However, a tuition-free university is not a tangible nor likely possibility here at UCSB. With
that being said, I believe that UCSB should reduce costs of tuition and offer more financial aid to
students, especially those from low-income households. Our university should not prioritize
profitability, but rather the cultivation of quality education whilst offering ample resources to the
student body in order to academically and personally succeed.","Although I recognize that UCSB has implemented CAPS in an effort to somewhat support
student mental health, I strongly believe that the expansion of mental health services is critical to
the health of our community. Mental health services are incredibly limited at UCSB; the
counseling center is simply not large enough to accommodate the needs of the growing student
population. CAPS is understaffed and overbooked, offering zero long-term services for students
who need them which inhibits students from maximizing their potential. It is necessary to
advocate for the implementation of more mental health resources as well as the additional
allocation of funds toward these projects in order to provide support to our community.","I am familiar with the university’s Title IX office and its functions toward ensuring a safer
environment for our community. I commend UCSB’s efforts to provide a framework through
which this institution aims to deter sexual harassment and discrimination. However, I feel as
though UCSB has neglected to expand on these efforts to support sexual assault survivors. It is
imperative that UCSB prioritizes outreach and maximizes their efforts to make their resources
available to the general student body in order for survivors to become aware of them.","I cannot testify to the experiences outside my own, but as a first-generation Latina student, I
believe that UCSB has failed to uphold its “Hispanic Serving Institution” title. This HSI title
provides additional increases in funds and support to universities whose population is at least
25% Hispanic. I have heard the grievances of many of my Hispanic peers and agree that UCSB
has failed to address the needs of this community. It is crucial to hold this university accountable
for their lack of transparency and communication.","If elected to serve on the A.S. Senate, the first bill or resolution I plan to author is the expansion
of CAPS services. I am committed to seeking ways in which students can be supported beyond
the academic realm. The record breaking university enrollment calls for a dire need to expand
resources that parallel the capacity of the student population. In addition, it is necessary to
increase awareness of campus resources in order for students to take advantage of them.","A.S is definitely seen as inaccessible to the average student. It is necessary to facilitate an easier
route of transparency as well as communication between the Senate and the student body. For
this reason, I would work to inform the student body on the initiatives implemented by the
Senate and encourage individuals to involve themselves in voicing their concerns and sharing
their experiences to this student government.","When facing unprecedented allegations at this scale and capacity, I believe that communication
should have been further encouraged rather than suppressed. Failing to meet for seven weeks,
almost an entire quarter, seems irresponsible. With that being said, I am not well-informed on the
logistics of their meeting failures, so I cannot comment with certainty why such challenges
occurred. Nonetheless, amidst the allegations of negligence, financial mismanagement,
anti-Blackness, and discrimination, it is evident that Associated Students as a whole failed to
respond in a prompt manner. I believe that open lines of communication should have been
prioritized in response to such challenges.","Presidential executive orders are utilized in an effort to uphold the democratic tenets of
Associated Students and direct the actions of the Senate to implement policies that align with
such values. These executive orders should be implemented only when absolutely necessary,
such as the removal of former IVP Bee Shaefer.","There needs to be a standardized procedural mechanism in place to defer backups in A.S.
employee honoraria. In other words, there should be a clear process through which employees
are awarded. There should be a designated committee in place to mediate the honoraria process
and ensure that backups do not occur again. By outlining eligibility criteria, and by establishing
transparency regarding timelines, the honoraria process can be adjusted to prevent situations like
this from reoccurring."
Emily von Zedtwitz,Holly,Off-Campus Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23131501/Emily_von_Zedtwitz.jpg,,She/Her,First-Year,Political Science,,,"I have always been dedicated to public service and policy making. The role of a Senator
combines these passions and my commitments are demonstrated in my current
position serving as an On-Campus Senator and working on issues that directly benefit
you.","Nominated and appointed an On-Campus Senator during the academic year required
me to adapt and learn quickly to meet the demands of Senate responsibilities. Involved
in various activities, I am a member of the AS External Affairs Committee, club swim,
UCSB political affiliated club through which I resonate with diverse groups within the
university’s student population. As a fluent Mandarin and German speaker with
overseas experience, I can relate to and represent a broad student population’s
interests and needs. Additionally, I will also be able to represent Greek Life as I plan
on joining the pre-professional law fraternity.","Currently, only half of IV’s 23,000 residents are UCSB students, with a substantial
remaining SBCC tenant population. I will negotiate a housing priority for UCSB
students with the Tenants Union to secure rental leases ahead of SBCC students.
Additionally, I will advocate for increased bus frequency and expand routes to reduce
additional transportation costs for students living in more affordable towns.
Ultimately, SBCC is located roughly 20 minutes from Isla Vista, while UCSB is in its
immediate proximity. As UCSB students deserve housing preference in Isla Vista,
negotiations with the IV Tenants Union is indispensable to relieving thousands of
UCSB students from falling victim to the housing crisis.
Everyone can relate to the experience of having to catch up two weeks into the quarter
after being taken off the waitlist for a course someone drops last minute. The syllabus

provided during the first week outlines the subject in depth, sets student expectations,
and informs on workload, often acting as the final determinant to whether students
opt to remain or drop the class. I will propose a mandate for professors to post their
syllabus, clarifying content and workload on GOLD during course registration to avoid
this issue.
Following the outsourcing of dental and vision services, the Ocean Road Project is
proposing to demolish the Student Health Building without the consent of the student
body. The University’s failure to adequately provide healthcare services including
reproductive care, vision and dental care, addiction counseling, medical services, and
physical therapy would blatantly disregard the health and safety of its students. As
Senator, I will work to ensure that the university establishes a permanent facility that
continues to provide the same quality of care.","As a current senator, I have been actively engaging with the student body from all
levels to represent their voice and working closely with fellow senate members to
work out policies and introduce new bills for implementation in alignment with the
university administration and using my position in the External Affairs Committee to
involve other external organizations as necessary. To ensure the student body keeps
up with AS ongoing initiatives and progress, I will work with fellow senators to
promote timely communication of AS resources offered and ongoing progress of
initiatives on social media, school news outlets, and postings on campus bulletin
boards.","As my first platform aims to maximize off-campus housing opportunities for UCSB
students, I plan to work with the IV Tenants Union to negotiate housing priority. My
second platform targeting course registration difficulties necessitates the
involvement of the university administration, GOLD technicians and professors.
Third, ensuring students' continued accessibility to healthcare on campus requires
negotiation and active engagement with the university administration to provide
equivalent healthcare alternatives for our students.","Aside from holding weekly office hours where students can come to me with concerns,
I plan on introducing a Monthly Forum, a direct platform of open communication
between the student body and Senators, in which anyone can attend.","From my ongoing role as an On-Campus Senator, I have developed the knowledge and
network critical to carry out this job. Strong creativity, problem-solving and
interpersonal communication skills equip me to effectively negotiate and influence
others towards a consensus or compromise in implementing change. Additionally,
having grown up overseas, I am familiar with Asian, European and American cultures
and perspectives that allow me to relate to diverse interests, needs and ideas.","(d) Other (less than 30 words):
I believe in decision making based on student body input and interests, irrespective of
my personal political beliefs.","(e) Poor
Please explain (less than 100 words):
The 74th A.S. Senate has been marked by internal strife with leadership turnovers that
has negatively affected its functionalities and ability to execute its duties. In addition,
the process of passing bills and resolutions has been excessively and unnecessarily
cumbersome, resulting in little progress in implementing improvements.","Human rights violations are a very serious issue that needs to be studied carefully and
confirmed as to the reasons and the culprits. As a formal institution, our university
governing body should not engage with parties that continue to support and profit
from such violations.","(b) No
Please explain (100 words):
The university requires substantial funding to attract top professors and invest in
programs that allow it to operate as a top academic institution. Currently, UCSB
funding comes from both the state and student tuition. If UCSB were tuition-free and
state sponsored, other UC campuses would also follow suit for this privilege which
would be too great of a burden for the state, setting an unsustainable precedent. As
need-based financial aid is currently available and granted to eligible students that
meet the criteria, there is no need to consider a tuition-free university.","While the university’s Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) does offer several
mental health programs ranging from a one-time one-on-one consultation (Let’s
Talk program) to a 24/7 crisis line, its service availability is not sufficient. As first
hand experience, making an appointment requires several steps including paperwork
and multiple call transfers that amounted to no one answering the calls during
operating hours, which may discourage students from using these services. The
university needs to hire enough personnel to handle these calls during operating
hours.","Victims of sexual assault must often confront health problems including anxiety,
depression, and PTSD. Lack of anonymity when reporting a Title IX complaint may
further hinder victims from coming forward. The university can better support
victims unwilling to reveal their identity with an anonymous counseling hotline.","I can only speak to historically marginalized groups that I can personally identify
with. UCSB’s various Asian student organizations exceeded my expectations of
supporting my Asian identity through hosting events, recognition of cultural holidays,
and providing us with a safe space to discuss issues we face as a historically
underrepresented minority. However, allowing right-wing extremists to use
university facilities to spread hateful speech and propel their agenda exposed the
university’s failure to comply with their commitments to diversity, equity, and
inclusion, as well as a failure to protect all marginalized groups.","Course registration based on pass times is not only a stressful experience, but
simultaneously produces extremely unfinalized schedules. Students often count on
waitlists to be accepted into a course, relying heavily on other students to drop. As a
result of this uncertainty in enrollment, students are often faced with the dilemma of
having to decide whether or not to do the work of the class they are hoping to switch
out of as acceptance off a waitlist can take up to two weeks. Students usually end up
dropping after realizing that a course’s high student expectations and workload
amount prevents a balanced schedule. If elected, I will work to ensure that professors
post their syllabus, including their student expectations, content, and workload, on
GOLD during course registration so that students register for a class they want to be in
from the start.","As your senator, I will propose to send monthly emails to the student body with the
purpose of involving and informing students about progress on ongoing initiatives, all the services and resources it offers, as well as to solicit direct student input. At the
same time, I will recommend collaborating with Daily Nexus to keep students
informed. Our social media presence on Instagram and Facebook provides an
additional source of communication. Students are always welcome to come to my
weekly office hours, and are invited to attend Senate meetings.","As elected officials, these allegations need to be taken very seriously. I would have
sought to gather information and evidence to confirm or reject the allegations. Senate
meetings must be held according to the predetermined schedule where there is a
quorum. To ensure financial integrity and transparency in managing the budget of
over $12 million, I would recommend to perform an independent audit with a report
on uses of funds. Any violations of regulations and unethical behaviors should be
referred to a disciplinary body with a trial to hear cases and impose penalties in the
form of service hours or fines as necessary.","Any removal of senior leadership positions must first include a thorough investigation
with evidence showing negligence, incompetence or failure to discharge duties before
a democratic vote by the Senators where a majority should prevail.","Honoraria is awarded upon a thorough review of application to ensure eligibility. The
Senate Finance Subcommittee is responsible to set up the approved honoraria and
ensure timely payment to the approved team members. As an annual audit at year end
is to be conducted, any missed payment would be detected and made up in time."
Enri LaLa,,Letters & Science Collegiate Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23131508/Enri_Lala.jpg,,he/him,First-Year,History,,,"There were two reasons that made me decide to run for Senator. Firstly, I am deeply passionate
about issues which are best addressed by the Senate, from reforming the housing process to
improving club funding and connecting our school to the community outside of our campus.
Secondly, I believe I have the ability to contribute to student government. Throughout the last
few years, whether by founding and presiding over an American Red Cross Club or through
public speaking, I have been working to improve both my communication and leadership skills,
which I consider the most important traits in a student leader. I believe in the effectiveness of
student government when the student body participates in the process, which I aim to enhance by
raising awareness of resources.
I will also offer a fresh perspective to student government. Growing up in Albania and
immigrating to the U.S. has given me a distinctive worldview, which will be a positive addition
to the plethora of different experiences represented on our campus. I believe being new to
UCSB’s student government will be an asset – after all, if we want to create a better campus, we
will need new voices and perspectives.","The two experiences that were most important in my decision to run for the Senate are as
different as they are equally important. The first of these has been participating in the Ethics
Bowl team, where we debate philosophy with colleges from around the country. This experience
has simultaneously developed my communication and leadership skills while making me more
aware of the problems with club funding on campus.
The second experience has been volunteering with the organization School on Wheels, with
which I tutor kids experiencing homelessness. This work has deepened my passion about making
a contribution in the homelessness crisis while also makimg me more aware of how much better
connected our campus needs to be with outside organizations if we want to make a positive
impact on the larger community.
Both of these experiences have shaped key parts of my platform. As Senator, I will work to
ensure that clubs are funded much more efficiently and that students have better opportunities to
work with organizations whose missions they are passionate about.","First in order would be a resolution demanding that the school administration match the
amount of new student housing built with increases in student population. I have come to
understand the importance of this issue by personal experiences and speaking to fellow
students. We cannot expect students to thrive if they do not have secure access to basic
needs such as housing. To solve this issue, it is crucial to understand its causes and make
sure that higher student enrollment does not continue to have negative consequences on
the student body. This can be accomplished by thoughtful and responsible
communication of student needs to the school administration.
2. Legislation to secure adequate club funding. A.S.'s sizable budget is common knowledge,
but so are the difficulties clubs face when seeking funding for their activities. While
recognizing that this is a complex process, I will work to present legislation ensuring that
each club receives the funding needed to succeed.
3. I aim to propose a resolution from the Senate ensuring that in the case of future internal
divisions, employee honoraria and other necessary funds be provided. This would be
crucial to fulfilling our duties as student representatives, maintaining the well-being of
employees on campus and restoring trust in student government.","My platform is defined by the goal of creating a prosperous and united campus. To achieve this
objective, I have identified some of the most pressing issues our campus faces. Firstly, to reform
the housing process we will need not only the student government to act but to communicate
with and hold the school administration accountable. The second platform issue, that of
improving club funding, can be resolved by a more effective student government. I aim to better
communicate with all clubs on campus regarding their needs, so that each one is equipped to
prosper. Thirdly, fostering better connections between our campus community and outside
organizations will take relentless work by both student leaders and individual students. As a
Senator, I will contribute to this vision by contacting outside organizations while coordinating
efforts with members of our campus. Finally, I recognize that in order to fulfill this vision it is
crucial to constantly communicate with, and receive feedback from, the students I represent.","I look forward to working with organizations already doing excellent work in our community,
especially the Isla Vista Community Services District and the Isla Vista Tenants Union on issues
concerning housing and beyond. I seek to be a new voice in student government, which will be
complemented by the experience such organizations have to offer.

Just as importantly, in order to expand our campus’ connections with the larger community and
offer students better opportunities, I aim to work with local organizations such as the Santa
Barbara City Council, the Santa Barbara Foundation and others. These collaborations are rooted
in the understanding that our campus plays a significant role in the larger community, and that
the more we are positively involved, the better.
Finally, as previously mentioned, I volunteer with the organization School on Wheels, which
helps students throughout Southern California. This experience has made me passionate about
enabling students to bring the organizations and activities they are passionate about closer to
campus.","Oftentimes the problem on our campus is not that resources aren’t available, but simply that
there is not enough awareness of them. This issue was one of the major reasons I decided to run
for Senator. I believe we will move beyond the image of student government as a “fake
government”, one which is inaccessible and out of touch, by connecting its work more personally
to each student. To achieve this, I will firstly make my my information readily available to all
students. But this is not enough. I aim to use my communication skills to build a better
connection between students and the government which represents them, addressing the issues
they are most concerned about and asking for feedback. I will encourage town-hall meetings,
where students will get to speak directly to their representatives.
It is just as important to make resources more accessible. I believe as much work needs to go into
presenting A.S. initiatives and programs to the student body as goes into preparing them. For
example, I will present a concrete idea: every event happening on campus should be sponsored
by a different campus organization, including a description letting students know what each
program offers. This would be effective in raising awareness of important resources on campus
without requiring any extra effort from students.","Passion and ability: I believe these two factors make me best suited to be a Senator.
Firstly, living on campus my first year has channeled my passion for public service toward the
most important issues and causes of our community. From reforming housing to improving club
funding and building a more involved campus, I will show an unparalleled level of commitment,
driven forward by a deep belief in what we as students are capable of. Secondly, while gladly
recognizing that I have much to learn, I have spent years building the abilities that are most
important in a student leader. My public speaking and debate experiences have made me more
effective as a communicator, while working with non-profit organizations and competitive teams
have taught me the value of leadership and organization. To create a better campus, we need new

ideas and fresh voices. I hope to be part of a new generation of student leaders who are willing to
sacrifice and put divisions aside, while being in constant communication with the students we
represent.
I have a clear vision of a strong and prosperous campus, and I believe I can make my
contribution to it by serving as a Senator.","(d) Other: I believe evaluating each policy decision before voting is much more valuable than
following any party line.","(d) Fair: While I do not discount the work the outgoing Senate has done to the benefit of the
community, I believe much of this effort was drowned out by a sense of disorganization, with
students viewing the Senate as a distant entity which was more concerned with its own issues
than theirs. These experiences should be seen as valuable lessons by the next generation of
Senators, so that we can provide a more effective and accessible student government.","c) Other: Being Albanian, I have often heard outsiders express opinions on my country’s
complex geopolitical issues in the Balkans when they did not know enough about the subject. I
believe it’s common courtesy for me not to do something similar with other issues. While I
strongly stand with the struggle for human rights around the world, I believe expressing an
opinion that is not fully formed would be counterproductive.","(b) I strongly believe that no student should be driven away from applying to or attending UCSB
because of the cost. This can be achieved by offering need and merit-based aid, including
full-ride scholarships, to as many students as possible, which would encourage equity and
fairness. For this to be achieved, however, we have to consider the full picture. This means that
those with the financial means to pay, in-part or in-full, should do so as far as they are capable.
Though I would agree with the proposition that some of what is covered through tuition could be

funded by the state or federal government, it is in part these tuition funds which provide the
experience and education we enjoy on campus.","Mental health resources on campus could be improved and made more accessible. To be clear, I
don’t believe that the issues with these resources as they currently exist are due to any
shortcomings by our dedicated staff. Rather, the UCSB student population has drastically
increased in recent years. With a larger student population, more resources need to be available –
with mental health services being among the most important. For example, every residence hall
could have a mental health resource center, making it easier for underclassmen to access help.
As Senator, I hope to start a conversation with the school administration and other stakeholders
about matching the resources the school offers with its larger student population. As previously
mentioned, for these resources to be effective, we also have to ensure better student awareness.","I am familiar with the Title IX office and the numerous valuable services it offers, all based on
ensuring students receive fair treatment regardless of gender, including in cases of sexual assault
and harrassment. The school can most effectively make an impact by increasing student
awareness of the resources at their disposal. Only if students know their rights can they make full
use of the functions of the Title IX office.","We could be doing more. As a History student, I am proud to be part of a campus which
recognizes the historical injustices that surround us. However, I believe it is time for us to go
beyond mere recognition. Let me offer a few examples: while recognizing that UCSB is founded
on the ancestral lands of the Chumash people is useful, we could be making a larger impact by
reaching out to Bands of the Chumash people and offering the resources at our disposal. While it
was crucial to recognize the acts of anti-Semitism that appeared in Isla Vista and on campus last
quarter, it is just as important to contact Jewish organizations in our community and coordinate a
response in solidarity. These efforts would both encourage higher student participation and
meaningfully connect our campus to the larger community.","One of the most pressing needs on our campus is addressing the housing crisis. This is why I aim
for my first resolution to be a request from the school administration to commit to providing
adequate housing for the growing student population, and to take concrete steps toward ensuring
that the number of students admitted does not negatively affect the student body.","The seeming inaccessibility of the Senate was a major factor in my decision to run. Besides
making all student representatives’ contact information readily available to the student
population, the most effective method to increase student awareness would be to have every
event on campus be sponsored by a different A.S. organization. These two initiatives would
ensure that students have better access to both their representatives and resources, an important
step towards making a better campus.","While I recognize that it is easier to comment on such matters from the outside, the level of
disorder that permeated the Senate is unacceptable. If faced with such a situation as Senator, I
would have prioritized communicating to my colleagues that as student leaders we have a higher
duty to the students we represent than to any conflicts that may emerge among us. In such
difficult circumstances, it is important to foster a sense of unity and remind those involved of the
common objective. It is also important to communicate with students and show that their
representatives are working to resolve conflicts.",NO ANSWER,"These backups were a major issue on our campus this school year, which I witnessed affect
multiple close friends of mine. I believe addressing issues of such importance are one of the few
instances where taking swift action is justified, whether by executives such as the President or by

enabling the Senate to meet under special circumstances. Whichever method is most effective
and best upholds the checks and balances of our system, we as student representatives have to
commit ourselves to always providing employee honoraria and other necessary benefits, and
recognize that not doing so would be a failure to fulfill our duties. As Senator, I hope to
introduce legislation setting up procedures for how to provide employee honoraria in cases
where the Senate’s functions are blocked."

Students to be a powerful force for good. With a massive budget, it has a unique opportunity to
develop experimental community programs that address the needs of students. My top priority
as an Off-Campus Senator is to ensure accessibility and affordability of campus programs,
which I believe can be achieved through various initiatives.
One of the most significant obstacles facing students is cost. As a senator, I will advocate for
increased funding for financial aid to help alleviate the financial burden for students. Additionally,
I will work to combat the exorbitant rent prices in Isla Vista that add to students' financial
struggles. Another concern for financially burdened students is food insecurity. I fully support
increasing funding for the A.S. Food Bank to ensure it can continue to provide for students in
need.
Equity is also a significant concern that I plan to address. Currently, international students are
treated as second-class citizens at UCSB. Regardless of their housing affiliation, they are
excluded from student-funded programs, which is unfair and discriminatory. I believe that all
fee-paying students should have equal access to these programs, regardless of their citizenship
status. This will be an important component of my legislative agenda.
Drug and alcohol outreach programs are essential to maintaining a healthy, non-abusive
substance environment in Isla Vista. By preventing substance abuse, we can ensure that
students maintain their health and academics. Mental health infrastructure is also key to
fostering an inclusive, healing space in Isla Vista.

Lastly, recreation is crucial to maintaining students' wellbeing. Students must feel empowered to
participate in activities of their choice. By ensuring that choice, and empowering students to
actualize their goals, Isla Vista can become a true academic paradise. Overall, I believe that
Associated Students has the potential to be a force for good and look forward to working
towards making that potential a reality as a senator.","As a freshman, I got my start in student government as a Representative-at-Large for the Santa
Rosa dormitories. This experience was just the beginning of my journey to becoming more
involved in student governance. In fact, it led me to join the re-election campaign for our
Congressman, Salud Carbajal.
Winter Quarter 2023 was a turning point in my involvement in A.S. UCSB. I was appointed to
the A.S. Senate via an Ad Hoc Committee tasked with ensuring a smooth transition from a
dysfunctional Senate that had struggled to make quorum, to an efficient and functioning Senate
that could consistently meet its goals of providing for all of its students.
During my time in the Senate, I had the pleasure of co-authoring a resolution in defense of
transgender youth, alongside Senator Granger Cruz-Brenneman. Senator Cruz-Brenneman's
work in maintaining an up-to-date government that truly represents its constituents is
impeccable.
Together with Senator Tessa Veksler, I authored a bill that allows military veterans to work in
construction sites funded by student fees. Previously, veterans were prevented from working on
construction projects if they were associated with a helmets-to-hardhats program. This bill has
helped remove unnecessary barriers that kept veterans from accessing student-funded jobs.
Lastly, I authored a letter on behalf of the ASUCSB to the CBC & the Sweeps advocating for an
extension to the eviction deadline. Although we have no legal basis to prevent the eviction, our
aim was to provide temporary housing to affected students through finals week. This would help
alleviate the stress that comes with being displaced from one's home and would allow us to
discuss emergency housing options using the dorms over the summer. This will provide
much-needed time to consider housing options for students who will be displaced by the
evictions in the upcoming academic year.
Through these experiences, I have learned the importance of being an advocate for those who
need it most. I am committed to continuing to fight for the rights of all students and to ensure
that our student government is transparent, efficient, and truly representative of the diverse
student body we serve.","As a member of the ASUCSB, I believe that it is important to introduce resolutions and bills that
address the pressing concerns and issues of students. Therefore, I plan to introduce three
resolutions or bills that I believe will have a positive impact on the student community.
Firstly, I would like to author a bill that will ensure equal access to programs funded by student
fees for all students. The Educational Opportunity Program, which provides financial support
and academic resources to low-income students, currently requires students to have filed a
FAFSA in order to receive benefits. This requirement discriminates against international
students who are not eligible to participate in the program. The bill would end this discriminatory
practice and make the ASUCSB's internal operations treat all fee-paying students equally.
Secondly, I believe that it is essential to provide more funding for food insecurity programs.
Many students struggle with food insecurity, which can have a significant impact on their
academic performance and overall well-being. By increasing funding for programs such as the
ASUCSB Food Bank, we can help alleviate this burden and ensure that all students have
access to healthy and nutritious food.
Lastly, I plan to introduce a resolution that will review the mental health programs currently
available to students. Mental health is a crucial aspect of student life, and it is essential that we
provide adequate resources and support to students who may be struggling. By reviewing the
existing programs and identifying areas for improvement, we can ensure that all students have
access to the mental health services they need.
In conclusion, I believe that introducing these resolutions and bills will help address some of the
critical issues facing the student community at UCSB. I am committed to working towards
creating a more equitable and supportive environment for all students and am confident that
these measures will have a positive impact on the student body.","As a senator, I believe that ensuring accountability and transparency in the use of student fees
is paramount. Therefore, I intend to propose the creation of a new standing committee that will
work closely with Boards, Committees, and Units (BCUs) to oversee funding requests and
budget review. This committee will be responsible for ensuring that student fees are being spent
in the most effective and efficient way possible, and that the funding goes towards programs
and initiatives that benefit the student body as a whole.
In addition to working on controls and compliance, I will continue to use my office to advocate
for projects that directly benefit students. I believe that advocacy and policymaking are equally
important parts of a senator's responsibilities. As a member of the External Affairs Committee, I
will work to advocate to state legislators to raise funds for the UC system. I will also work on
creating programs and initiatives that promote student wellness, including drug and alcohol
outreach programs, mental health outreach, and community service opportunities.

Overall, my platform is focused on creating a more equitable and inclusive campus environment
that promotes the wellbeing of all students. By advocating for funding and resources,
overseeing the use of student fees, and creating programs that address student needs, I am
confident that I can make a positive impact on the student body and help build a stronger and
more vibrant community at our university.","I hope to work with whichever organization that will endeavor to work with me in my progress
toward an inclusive learning environment.","I will set up in-person walk-in office hours — tangential to remote by-appointment office hours —
and advertise them on all Senate affiliated instagram accounts. I will be able to meet anywhere
in Isla Vista and on Campus for students to meet with me and discuss plans for the greater
community of peers and colleagues.","My extensive experience in various fields — Chemistry, Materials Science, Drama, Comparative
Literature — has provided me with the knowledge and skills required to thrive in this role. I have
honed my abilities through rigorous training in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and critical
reasoning, which have proven invaluable in navigating complex policy matters. I am as cutthroat
as I am flexible — I pride myself on my willingness to hear people out, understand perspectives,
and desire to work collaboratively with my peers.
Furthermore, my unwavering dedication to public service has been demonstrated through my
application of these skill sets to serving the community. I volunteered my skill set to the Senate
in Winter 2023 to ensure a proper transition of power to the next cohort of Senators. I intend to
continue the work I started as an appointed Senator in the 73rd Senate as an Elected Senator in
the 74th. I have consistently sought to effect positive change in my community, drawing on my
wealth of knowledge and experience to deliver impactful outcomes that prioritize students, not
politics.
I lead with conviction, and I prioritize communicating with clarity. My reputation as a dynamic
and results-driven leader is well-established for those that know me, and I am confident that I
can make a valuable contribution to the Senate if elected. In summary, my exceptional
qualifications, unwavering commitment to public service, and proven track record of success
makes me the best candidate for this position. I am eager to bring my skills and experience to

bear in service of the public good, and I am confident that I can deliver impactful outcomes if
given the opportunity to serve.",Left-leaning ,"Good. While the 73rd Senate may have experienced some
dysfunction in the first half of the year, it has since become a more efficient organization. One
indication of this is that after the shutdown, a great deal of proposed legislation was intended to
rectify the failings of the dysfunctional period earlier in the year. Overcoming obstacles like
administrative capture and executive overreach will significantly benefit the association in future
years. This suggests the Senate performed as flexibly as it could during this period and that
they fully intend to streamline the organization — I consider this good work. While there is
always room for improvement, I believe that the Senate has made strides towards greater
efficiency and effectiveness, and I am committed to continuing this progress if elected.","Yes and No. As a representative of A.S. UCSB, my priority is to serve
and represent the interests of all fee-paying students. The issue of divestment from companies
alleged to profit from human rights violations in Israel is a complex and sensitive matter. While I
am open to exploring possible solutions, I believe that any actions taken should not harm our
students or create division on our campus. As such, I would approach this issue with caution

and an open mind, and seek to work with colleagues from all backgrounds to find a compromise
that upholds the values of human rights and respect for all members of our community.","Yes. The UC system is a publicly funded institution that is intended to
serve the residents of California. As such, it is important that education at the UC be accessible
to all tax-paying students, regardless of their financial circumstances. Providing free education
to students who have contributed to the tax base is a fundamental principle of fairness and
equity. Education is an investment in the future of our society, and it is essential that it be given
the priority it deserves in terms of public funding. Ensuring that all students have access to
quality education is essential for creating a healthy and prosperous society.","Mental health services are critical to the success of students in any academic environment.
UCSB has made progress in improving mental health services, but there is still much more that
needs to be done. Students who are struggling with mental health issues are at risk of falling
behind in their studies and suffering from social and physical health problems.
While a one-stop-shop approach to mental health services may not be the solution, it is
important to develop a multi-faceted approach that addresses the needs of students in a variety
of ways. For example, community outreach programs can be established to provide support and
resources to students who may not be able to access traditional mental health services.
Additionally, hiring more mental health professionals can help to increase access to services
and provide more specialized care to students.
Another important aspect of mental health support is education. Students need to be taught how
to develop healthy coping mechanisms and strategies for managing their mental health.
Seminars and workshops can be organized to discuss these topics and provide students with
the skills they need to be successful in their academic and personal lives.
Finally, it is essential to invest in recreational activities that promote mental and physical
well-being. Research has shown that regular exercise can improve mood and reduce symptoms
of anxiety and depression. By providing students with access to recreational activities, we can
help to promote a healthy and active lifestyle that supports their mental health.
In conclusion, while progress has been made in improving mental health services at UCSB,
there is still much more that needs to be done. By taking a multi-faceted approach that includes

community outreach, education, and recreational activities, we can support students in
developing healthy mental health practices that will last a lifetime.","The Students Against Sexual Assault cohort at UCSB is a considerably impactful organization.
Currently, the board of directors of this organization is seeking to implement hair-testing for date
rape drugs at Student Health and nearby clinics. Student fees can be used to invest in more
resources to protect and assist survivors of sexual assault.
The University can do more by taking reports of sexual assault more seriously, conducting
investigations into organizations whose members are allegedly perpetrating acts of sexual
violence. The university should sanction organizations that consistently demonstrate their
ineptitude in protecting both men and women from the violence of sexual assault.
In either instance, both examples explain the importance of listening to survivors and taking
their allegations seriously. By doing so, we can raise a dialogue about why perpetrators feel
empowered to commit these violent acts, foster a grassroots initiative to end sexual assault in
our community, and move toward an inclusive, empowering environment for survivors.","I do believe UCSB is adequately serving Black, Latine, and LGBTQ+ community members.
However, I would not consider UCSB to be effectively serving the Indigenous community, yet.
Presently, UCSB holds Indigenous ancestral remains and artifacts in violation of California Law
underneath the HSSB. They have been in violation of these laws for many years, but have
always cited “not enough funding” as their reason for being unable to repatriate these remains
with their descendants. Pressure from the Senate, or even funding to assist the repatriation
process may help us better serve the Indigenous community here at UCSB.",NO ANSWER,"It is part of the core function of the Senate to handle the policy making of the Association, but it
is also noted that the Senate is responsible for maintaining a healthy, open line of
communication with the student body. I am open to mandating each Senator to make an
individual instagram using their association email (as.ucsb.edu) and post informational graphics,
liaisonship assignments, upcoming events, and even legislative breakdowns of what the Senate
is doing in order to provide service to the student body.
If every Senator had 100 people following their account, that would be over 2,000 students
receiving information about the Association. If every Senator had 500 people connected on
social media, almost half the student body could be accounted for just through Instagram. The
town square has been digitized, and it is time for Associated Students to modernize and
embrace this change, rather than refer to the bulletin board outside of the library.","Since legislative authority was strictly limited in the Association because the IVP restricted the
times for the Senate to meet — and judicial authority is a nonstarter — the only proper avenue
to remedy this situation was through executive action. If I was a Senator, I would have appealed
to the executives sooner rather than later and ensured that 7 weeks of dysfunction would not
have happened. In government, legislative shutdown can spell doom for many student
organizations and events that they are interested in planning. If they cannot receive funding for
their events, it is the same thing as turning off life support.","I see executive orders as a necessary function of the executive office — namely, in terms of
checks and balances, but also in ensuring swift, flexible action that the president can direct the
association in taking in case of rapid change. The coronavirus pandemic, the failings of an IVP
with paying her employees, or incomplete classes as a result of a TA strike preventing students
from advancing into their major are all prime examples of spontaneous issues that could be
ameliorated with the use of executive action.","Streamlining honoraria essentially means that honoraria becomes a stipend. I view this
approach more favorably than honoraria because I am a firm believer that everyone should be
paid for their work. I am open to working with colleagues who are passionate about this matter
and will readily engage with proposals to amend and streamline A.S. Employee Honoraria."
Gabriela Salazar,Asumi,Letters & Science Collegiate Senator,https://dailynexus.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dailynexus/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/23131539/Gabriela_Salazar.jpg,,she/her,second-year,Political Science and Latin American and Iberian Studies,,,"""I am running to be your next senator to address the impacts COVID had on students, such
as our mental health, in-person activities, and financial security. During my term, I would
advocate for more financial support and resources for low-income students of all backgrounds to
aid the financial strain COVID created and continue to allow students to have the right to higher
education. I would also work with the different mental health organizations to better promote and
make accessible mental health services to support students' well-being and work on community
building so that students connect better with their campus. Additionally, I have grown to deeply
care for and get involved with our campus, which I now consider my second home. I have made
memorable memories with different communities and professionally developed through the
opportunities and experiences UCSB provides. Similarly, I am dedicated to creating a better UC,
one step at a time, where students feel a sense of belonging and pride when they think of their
university.""","Based on my leadership roles as the student engagement intern at the Undocumented
Student Services, AS Director of Dream Scholar Affairs, and Student Representative of the
Dream Scholar Resource team, I uplift and advocate for students of all backgrounds. As I work
alongside different departments to improve the quality and accessibility of academic and
financial resources necessary to make college affordable and help students navigate college, I
have connected with other students to assess their needs. Through trial and error in attempting to
reach students, I have learned the best ways to increase retention rates, coordinate events, and
create resources based on student needs. I also understand how to advise a diverse group of
students on their college hardships and direct them to resources and services. In doing so, I have
equipped the skills necessary to be a reliable L&S senator, such as how to support and guide
students based on their needs, amplify our voices, and advocate for all students to improve our
better college experience.","While in office, my resolutions would prioritize basic needs and financial and academic
support. One of the three resolutions I propose is to add Basic Needs Vending Machines
throughout different on-campus buildings, including the library, that only require an access card
and PERM number to address food insecurity. The vending machine is a great way to help
students that don't have access to a kitchen, can't afford to buy food all the time, or don't have the
time to stop by the dining halls. They provide various food and personal care items, including
prepackaged salads and sandwiches, soups, drinks, and students whom UCSB's financial crisis
team has approved may use the machine. My second resolution is to work on providing
low-income students with more financial support and resources by increasing emergency grants
and implementing a range of scholarships within department services as an incentive to increase
participation and reach students who are in need. For instance, USS provides various programs to
undocumented students that support them in navigating college, and by applying, students
qualify for a scholarship ranging from $500 to $1,000. I'd also propose bringing back preparatory
courses for competitive classes to adequately prepare students to succeed in their major by
working with different heads of staff and the president. In the past, there were introductory
chemistry and math courses to aid students in a smoother transition to their major classes. These
classes familiarize students with foundational concepts and built their academic confidence as
they feel more prepared for their major courses. During my first year as a Pre-Political Science
major, I had yet to gain experience with coding, stats, or research analysis. However, Professor
Mehta created an introductory course to the mathematical foundations students need in statistics
and political science. His class gave us the confidence we couldn't find anywhere else and
allowed me to pass the class I dreaded with an A.","As a first-generation college student, navigating college was difficult. However, with the
proper resources and guidance, I have come to deeply care for and appreciate UCSB; similarly, I
want my peers to feel that same fondness. To do so, my platform will consist of transparency and
dedication to create a safe and welcoming environment for students to discuss their goals and
concerns in our UCSB community. I will ensure that our voices are amplified and that our
student fees continue to fund resources and services supporting the student body as successful
gauchos. I'll take on the position and future projects with the student's voices in mind to ensure
that my goals aren't only mine but the students'. I will utilize the skills I have learned in my
current positions to organize and connect with different departments, stakeholders, and other
branches to ensure that projects happen with the utmost quality while following university
policies. And even though there may be times when we feel defeated together, we will strive and
continue to use our voices.","I plan to work with EOP, different academic departments, cultural organizations, and the
Undocumented Student Services to reach students of all backgrounds, connect with them on their
needs, and assess them through what they believe will most benefit other students.","As your next senator, I will take on the position transparently to create a safe
environment for everyone to discuss their goals and concerns in our UCSB community. I will
make sure to have office hours in person and on Zoom multiple times a week to provide ample
opportunity for students to meet with me. Additionally, my email will always be open to
everyone to utilize and ask questions or address their concerns, and I will do everything I can to
help.","I am the best candidate for this position because of the passion and skills I have
developed while interning at the Undocumented Student Services and AS Director of Dream
Scholar Affairs. Being a part of AS, I have learned how AS functions and undergoes the process
of coordinating all kinds of events, resources, and legal codes. Through my knowledge of legal
code, I am fully aware of my responsibilities as a senator and how to connect with others within
AS and other departments to collaborate for future projects. USS has also taught me how to
organize events and projects while helping improve services based on students' needs by
reevaluating and connecting with students. My passion for advocating for underrepresented
groups and creating a better college experience for all UCSB students has also grown as I get
more involved with school and build communities that make UCSB memorable. I understand
that all students have diverse college experiences and how crucial it is to cater to these different
needs, which is why it can be frustrating when it feels like we aren't being effectively supported.
However, as your next senator, I will work on creating a safe environment where students will
know their voices will be amplified and validated because it is our college.",Left-leaning ,"Fair. Fair because although the Senate has worked on projects to assess students' needs, I believe the
Senate lacks resources and services that inform students about their work and issues regarding
UCSB.","Yes. Without this resolution, UCSB will continue to support the
violation of human rights in Israel, and it's not what other UCSB students or I represent.","As a low-income student, I believe that UCSB's tuition is expensive, creating an unfair
advantage for most students, but I don't think it should be tuition free. This is because student
fees are necessary and provide general support for how the university provides resources and
events that aid us in our academic and personal lives.","The Mental health services at UCSB provide an array of various discussions, workshops,
and services to aid students from different backgrounds in their well-being but can improve on
the student outreach and counseling sessions that CAPS provides. For many students, CAPS is

where they check in with mental health professionals for counseling. Although CAPS does an
adequate job in short-term therapy, there must be more resources for long-term therapy. The
biggest problem is the issue of scheduling appointments which can take several weeks or even
months, as reported by students. This can be recognized as a need for more staff at such a large
institution. However, it is a significant problem considering that students' well-being is put on
hold and discouraged from attending any other mental health services because of the service at
CAPS. To address this, I would push to hire more mental health professionals so that more
students can access these counseling sessions. Additionally, while the Mental Health Peers and
Health and Wellness provide vast services, students often miss them because most need to be
made aware. To address this, flyers can be put up throughout campus where all students can
access them, such as the dorms, dining halls, and departments, and collaborate with different
departments and organizations to expand their outreach to other students.","I am familiar with and support the Title IX office and its functions. However, the
university can do more to help survivors of sexual assault by increasing the number of mental
health professionals available at CAPS to increase accessibility. Additionally, I would work with
CARE, CAPS, SASA, and Gaucho FYI to better inform all incoming and current students of
how sexual assault, domestic violence, and their rights.","Being a part of these groups, I think USCB can improve how effectively it serves
underrepresented groups. Over the years, I have observed how underrepresented groups struggle
much more with financial security, making higher education a privilege rather than a right.
Additionally, while faculty from different departments and organizations go out of their way to
provide additional help for students to succeed in their majors, there needs to be an improvement
in this being a collective effort. Due to the lack of preparation underrepresented students face, as
most come from low-income backgrounds, we need the support and understanding of all faculty
to let students know they are fully supported. Additionally, while most faculty understand and
make us feel welcomed and supported, there needs to be more diversity, which may create a
disconnect between students and their college as they think they won't be properly supported.","If elected, the first resolution I plan to set up various Basic Needs Vending Machines
throughout campus, including the library, to address food insecurity. I plan to work with different
departments, the library, Basic Needs, and the presidents to organize this project. The Basic
Needs Vending Machines only require an access card and PERM number to access an array of
food and personal care items, including prepackaged salads and sandwiches, soups, and drinks.
Those who don't have access to a kitchen, can't afford to buy food all the time, or don't have the
time to stop by the dining halls can utilize the machine anytime by getting approved by UCSB's
financial crisis team.","Although AS has organized projects that have benefited students of all backgrounds, they
can improve on accessibility due to a majority of students, including myself, not being up to date
with the Senate's work. However, I have learned from my current roles that students are more
involved when consistently reached directly. Therefore, during my term, I would create a weekly
newsletter that informs students of the issues regarding our UCSB community and what the
Senate is doing to address them, as well as opportunities available to them by AS. In doing so,
students are consistently provided news on issues and opportunities to be involved with AS and
on campus. I would also collaborate with different departments and organizations to reach more
students to promote AS-related opportunities and share updates on the Senate's work.","As a senator, I would not have agreed with how the situation was handled because that
only worsened the problem as it got ignored and pushed back. Instead, I would've worked harder
to deal with the problem and propose new steps to ensure it would not happen again. As for the
anti-blackness and discrimination allegations, I would've protected historically marginalized
groups by taking accountability and working with the president to propose the following steps to
ensure that any form of discrimination would never happen. It would also be crucial to focus on
rebuilding a safe and welcoming environment that allows the student body to voice its discontent
with the Senate.","The role of executive orders is to keep AS running smoothly and efficiently whether or
not there is unprecedented dysfunction. The executive order should take proper actions to
prevent a conflict from worsening while keeping the Senate and AS in mind. Executive orders
are the final say and can significantly impact both AS and the Senate, so it's essential to use them
to keep everyone accountable for their actions and maintain the branches in place.","Streamlining the honoraria process is a collective effort, and that would be one of the first
steps to addressing the issue so that everyone takes accountability. I would then work with AS to
spot the problem and propose resolutions to prevent future dysfunctions."

As a student in the College of Engineering, I felt irrelevant and powerless as  there was no one to represent me.  
Upon doing some further research, referencing the historical data from past AS elections, and  learning more about the current state of the A.S. from current senators, I found that student  participation in the AS, especially, is at a devastating historic low. The voter turnout rate 
during the 2022 spring election dropped 28% in proportion in two years, from almost 29% in  2020 to barely over 20% in 2022, which is nowhere near the 37% median from 2009 - 2019.  Smaller elections, such as the special elections held in 2021 and 2023 winter, consistently  had turnouts lower than 10%. 
Granted, there are some historical reasons that voter turnouts aren’t as high as it was before,  yet it is unmistakable that the A.S. is growing increasingly irrelevant to the student  experience at UCSB. Moreover, this problem has the potential to spiral into a self-fulfilling  prophecy – the more irrelevant A.S. becomes, the fewer people care about it, and it is less  likely that the problem of its irrelevancy is fixed. As time passes, it seems like an  organization like this is doomed to fade into silent obscurity. 
I don’t want that to happen.  
I am not the smartest person, the most qualified person, or the most hard-working person at  UCSB or even in the College of Engineering, far from it. I am a socially awkward student of  average talent whose first language isn’t even English. I have a lot to learn, and the problems  that I have proposed don’t have a simple solution. 
However, the “nobody cares” problem isn’t solved by waiting for the smartest person, the  most qualified person, or the most hard-working person to show up and airdrop a perfect  solution. We simply need somebody, anybody, a nameless nobody, who actually cares about  the problem to start taking small steps in the right direction. If that person really cares, well,  maybe others around them will start caring more.  
I am committed to being that person.","During the fall quarter this year, I was very honored to have been given the opportunity to do  research with faculty in the Computer Science and Computer Engineering departments as  part of the 2022 Early Research Scholars Program cohort. This opportunity gave me  extremely valuable connections to faculty and staff in the College of Engineering as well as  graduate and undergraduate students. If elected, these would be excellent resources for me to  learn about the needs of my constituent. Throughout the program, in combination with my  previous experiences in collaborative environments such as robotics teams and musical  productions, I have also learned and practiced invaluable skills in organizing and mobilizing  a team to accomplish specific goals, such as methods for setting up open, reliable, and  constructive channels of communication, building robust infrastructure for collaboration, and  researching topics thoroughly and efficiently. I believe that these are skills that can only be  learned and perfected through practical application, and they have prepared me very well to  be a senator.

In my time at UCSB thus far, I have witnessed ways in which students struggle. Some of these include financial difficulties, safety concerns, as well as a housing crisis making it difficult for off campus students to attend UCSB. As someone who is particularly interested in government and political systems, I have begun to look into ways in which I can make a difference in my
own community, and this passion has led me to the Associated Student’s senate. As a student running for the Associated Students senate, I hope to make a difference in these areas, advocating for financial policy which benefits students, making Isla Vista a safer place, as well as exploring potential solutions to the housing crisis facing Isla Vista. Though my time at UCSB has been a positive and life changing experience, I believe that it is necessary to realize there is always change for the positive that can be made, and as students, I feel it is our responsibility to further improve this great school for future generations of UCSB students. ","In my time at UCSB, I have become involved with clubs that advocate for underrepresented groups and diverse opinions, and this is one way in which I have gained important experiences and perspectives that can prepare me to be a senator. By engaging with a range of voices and perspectives, I have developed a deeper understanding of the issues that face different communities at UCSB, as well as the strengths and challenges of diverse viewpoints. In addition to developing a broad and nuanced understanding of different perspectives, my involvement in these clubs can also help to develop important skills such as communication and leadership. Through helping to organize events and engaging with others I have developed an ability to effectively work with others and advocate for change.I am also interested in political activism, and at my time at UCSB I have attended several political conventions which provided me valuable opportunities to learn about the political process and gain experience in campaigning and advocating for issues students face on Campus. Overall, my involvement with politically active organizations on campus, as well as my interest for political activism provides experience and a well-rounded skill set which would adequately prepare myself to be a senator at UCSB. ","Three large issues which I would like to pass into bills or resolutions while serving as a senator would be financial reform in terms of commuter parking, changes to the dining hall meal plans, as well as programs to destigmatize campus police at UCSB and in Isla Vista. In terms of parking, I would like to potentially create more affordable parking availability for students who are financially struggling. This could be done through a more progressive parking plan, including increasing the number of parking spaces in or near campus, free or reduced parking on weekends as well as financial assistance programs to help struggling students be able to commute to campus. I would also like to reform the dining hall meal swipes systems, allowing meal swipes to carry over from week to week and allowing students to use extra meal swipes to admit guests. This would help to incentivise off campus students to choose meal plans, and would financially benefit the students. I would also like to bridge the gap between campus police and students, which could be done through outreach programs including presentations","My platform consists of financial reform in order to help financially struggling students. One of the largest issues plaguing UCSB and the community of Isla Vista is the financial burden that students are stuck with, and although a lot of this comes with the simple reality of living away at college, there are small improvements that our school could make in order to help to","In the future, I hope to work with the UCSB Transportation and Parking services, UCSB Campus Dining, and the UCSB police department and IV foot patrol. I hope to work with the UCSB Dining and the UCSB Transportation and parking services in order to create a more financially accountable and beneficial campus. Community relations is also something that I am passionate about, and I believe that I could work with the UCPD and the Isla Vista foot patrol to make this a reality. I hope to organize community events with the help of the UCPD and foot patrol to educate people about their rights and legal issues that our community faces. This would help to eliminate the negative stereotype around cops which is present in Isla vista, and would help to create a more safe and inclusive community. As an AS senator, I would like to work with the Transportation and Parking services and the UCSB Campus Dining to help create more affordable solutions for commuters and off campus students. I also would like to work with the UCSB campus police and the IV foot patrol to create a more positive environment in Isla Vista through creating community outreach projects.","As an Off Campus Associated Student Senator, I would make myself available to my fellow students both in person and electronically. As a senator I will provide designated hours where I will be available in person for fellow students to meet with me and discuss potential impacts they would like to see in the student government. I will also host this meeting on zoom so that students unable to attend in person meetings could still have their voices heard. I will also be available on instagram, where I will have a public account where students can message and I will be able to communicate with them in that capacity. I will also post in progress updates and Associated Student senate news on this account. Meeting with fellow students is important because it is my duty as a representative to hear and express the needs of my constituents. In order to do so I will be available in person, online, and on social media in order to hear the needs of the community. This will allow me to address concerns which may arise in the community, and it will also allow me to better represent my constituents and accurately reflect what they want to see in student government. ","I believe that I am the ideal candidate for this position because I am hard working and motivated to improve our community and to create a better UCSB for future generations. I am passionate about government and politics, and I feel my passion for this subject would make me a great candidate for AS senate. Throughout my time at UCSB I have seen the best and worst parts of living in Isla Vista, and I have become motivated to create change. Creating a more safe, inclusive, and affordable environment in Isla Vista is something that I am committed to working towards, and my hardworking attitude would make me an ideal candidate for this position. I also have experience in the realm of political activism and involvement, having a passion for social issues as well as representing the voices of those underrepresented. As an AS senator, I would be committed to representing my constituency and allowing my fellow students to present the changes they see fit to our school. I believe that I am the ideal candidate for this position because I am hardworking, and motivated to improve our community through my passion for government and politics, as well as my commitment to represent my fellow students in a way in which everyone's voices are heard. ",Left-leaning,"Poor; The 74th Associated Students senate has done a poor job representing the students of UCSB. Mismanagement, Disfunction, a lack of proper senate meetings are all examples of failings in the current Associated Students senate. It is not very poor however, as I have attended meetings within the winter quarter and felt as though the senate was for the most part properly representing the interests of the students at UCSB. ","Although I would take the stance of condemning all human rights violations throughout all nations and would support taking stances against companies which profit from these violations, I do not feel that I know enough about the situation to make an informed and decisive decision on this question. I am more than happy to meet and discuss this issue with on campus organizations and individuals in our community so I can come to an informed opinion on this issue.","No, While our school should do its best in helping low income students with the financial burden of tuition, it is ultimately not possible for UCSB to become tuition free. Professors, TA’s, and other school services such as cleaning and dining need to get funding, and placing this burden entirely on the state of California would not be possible. Ultimately creating a tuition free UCSB would not be possible as the university would not be able to operate provided it was not receiving funds from students. However, I feel as though financial struggles should not block people from attending UCSB, and we should provide ways to get help paying tuition. ","While I think that UCSB has the right intentions when it comes to mental health services for the students on campus, I ultimately think that there are problems that cause the mental health services at UCSB to be less than adequate. An example of this is the UCSB CAPS system, which stands for Counseling and Psychological services. The CAPS service has great intentions, serving as an on campus counseling service for students at UCSB, however students at UCSB may have difficulty accessing this service. In my time at UCSB I have heard stories of students struggling to access CAPS, and because of this, UCSB could better serve student’s mental health through increasing the funding to CAPS, as well as funding more programs to increase the mental health of students. In conclusion, I think that UCSB has good intentions in helping students with their mental health, however, I think that the mental health offerings at UCSB could be improved by increasing the funding for CAPS as well as funding additional programs to help with this issue. ","The UCSB Title IX office serves an important position in the UCSB and Isla Vista community, and although I believe that the Title IX office is essential to creating a safe university, there is still more that can be done to address the prevalent problem of sexual assaults on campus.","UCSB is a college which prides itself on serving historically underrepresented groups, and as a university I feel we do a great job doing such. As a university, we provide many services to help underrepresented groups. Examples of this include the Resource Center for Seual and Gender Diversity, which helps to provide services to the LGBTQ+ community, the EOP, The education opportunity program for first gen university students, and finally the many on campus cultural centers including the AdCRC, the AIICRC, and the CLCRC. These three resource centers provide resources to students in the African American, Indigenous, and Latin American communities at UCSB. I ultimately think that UCSB does a great job serving underrepresented groups, and we should continue to do so in the future. ","If elected to the AS senate, the first bill that I would write would be a bill targeting the financial practices of UCSB. I would like to focus on meal swipes and dining reform. Most off campus students either do not have a meal plan or have a low meal plan with very few meals each week. I think that if the university changed some of the dining hall meal swipe policies, the dining halls will appeal more to off campus students. The policy changes which I think would improve dining halls for off campus students would be allowing meal swipes to carry over and allowing students to use extra swipes to admit guests into the dining hall. If students could carry over meal swipes, they would be able to purchase less meal swipes in total, lowering the cost and making it more appealing to off campus students. Allowing guests into the dining hall would also benefit students who have unused meal swipes as it would allow them to bring guests who do not have a meal plan. Oftentimes off campus students who purchase a meal","It is true that Associated Students is often seen as inaccessible to the average student at UCSB, and there is a lot I would do as a senator to increase the visibility and participation in Associated Students. One thing that I would do to involve the student body and keep them informed about the inner workings of associated students would be to hold meetings that UCSB students could attend to discuss student body concerns. I would hold these meetings weekly both online and in person. This would allow the average student to be involved in the inner workings of the AS senate. I would also use my public social media accounts to post updates in the AS senate and keep the student body informed. Through hosting meetings with my constituents each week in both in person and online formats as well as updating students through my public social media accounts I will be able to keep the informed and involved about what the senate is currently doing. ","The 2022-23 AS senate faced unprecedented internal dysfunction. The Senate did not meet for 7 weeks amidst allegations of negligence, financial mismanagement, anti-Blackness and discrimination, and violations of legal code. If I was a senator during this time of struggle, I would have pushed to resume senate meetings during this period of inactiveness. As elected officials representing students on the UCSB campus it is the job of the senators to actively represent their voter base. By not doing so they are failing in their duty to represent the students which have elected them. Because of this, If I was a senator at this time, I would have pushed for the senate to resume. I would critique my performance had I been a senator at this time because I would have not represented my constituents for 7 weeks, meaning the voices of my voter base would not have been heard in the senate. ","As a senator, I see the role of executive orders to be rare and only used when the Associated Student government cannot effectively sort out any potential issue through the use of the senate and other student government bodies. I view the executive order as being indicative of a falling within the checks and balances of the student government, and because of that I feel it should only be used sparingly when the student government is not able to solve the issues present without the use of an executive order. ",I would prevent situations like the back up of employee’s honoraria through making sure that employee honoraria is awarded on time and that employees are compensated for their work in the senate.

Every student at UCSB is unique and has different issues that they want addressed. It is immensely important to me for them to know that they have a voice and that the people in their student government want to hear those voices and work on the issues that matter to them. AS is special in that it’s a body by the students and for the students and has the capability to create real change within our community. I want to not only be a part of making that change happen but help the general body at UCSB be part of the change as well. Our school is one that people deserve to have pride in and I want to make that happen for them by focussing on the pressing issues that are on their minds.
","As of this year, I’ve been involved with multiple campus organizations that advocate for the wants and needs of different groups of students throughout Isla vista. I’ve worked with Campus Democrats to register UCSB students to vote as well as turn out the vote last election day, allowing me to help students get involved with both their local and larger scale governments. I’ve also joined Planned Parenthood Generation Action in their campaigns to fight for reproductive justice and access to reproductive healthcare on our campus as well as working with YDSA and the Union of Academic Workers in aiding the strike efforts of the TA’s and student researchers that keep our school running. Organizing with these groups has not only improved upon my skills in leadership, teamwork, and organizing but has also taught me that my voice and my actions within the community have power. I want to help other students on campus realize that they are heard and valued and have the same opportunities to create the changes that they want to see within their school and beyond. ","First and foremost I would want to hear from the student body about what the most pressing issues are to them. As a senator, I would be a representative of the students and it is of utmost importance to me to place greater emphasis on solving their concerns than solving my own. That being said, I am interested in introducing bills in areas such as diversity and equity on our campus, student housing, and safety within the community of Isla Vista. Given the increasing urgency of our housing crisis and the recent and unprecedented spread of bigotry and hate speech on our campus in many different capacities, issues like these have become even more pressing and relevant than ever to UCSB students. They are areas that the students have loudly and proudly expressed their opinions on and I believe that with the input of the community at large, there are many things that AS and the power that it holds can do to alleviate the concerns of the students.","My ultimate goal in running to be a senator is to make the student government more accessible to and more representative of the students of UCSB. Last year, I, like many students here, didn’t know all that much about AS or what it did as an organization. Once I found out, I didn’t feel like it was somewhere that I had a voice. Ultimately, I hope to work as a team with the other senators of the 75th senate to change that and make AS a place where students know they are heard and have people who are willing to work for them and with them to make change they want to see within their community a reality.","Every student and every organization on our campus deserves to have a place where they can speak on their ideas and their concerns and I hope to work with as many of them as possible to help them voice those concerns to the people who can do something about it. While I can’t promise to agree with every organization, I would personally love to hear from any campus group to discuss what issues matter most to them. Notably, hearing from organizations that look out for the majority of the student body as well as marginalized communities such as AS Score and the Trans and Queer Commision as well as organizations that I have already worked with is very important to me and I would love to hear more of their input in our student government.
","My Email and DMs are and will always be open to those who want to share their opinions or the issues that matter to them and even though I am a full time-student, I try to keep on top of all forms of communication. Whether my constituents just want to have a chat or meet with me one on one in person or remotely to discuss what’s on their mind, I will always do my best to fit them into my schedule. The student government should work for the people and that includes listening to the comments and concerns of students all across our campus.","There are so many wonderful candidates running for election this year and I am beyond grateful to be among them. What makes me personally well-suited for this position is that I have plenty of experience both in leadership positions and in working as a team which are vital skills to the role of a senator. I am ready and willing to not only take charge but to step back and let others take charge when necessary. I also feel confident in my abilities to represent the student body because I share a lot of their ideals as well as their concerns with how the student government works. With the help of the other senators, I truly think that we have the capability to improve student government internally and make it work for the students like it’s supposed to and I’m excited to hopefully be a part of that.",Left-leaning,Fair ,Yes,"No. While I wish that higher education was completely free, at this time I unfortunately do not think that ideal is feasible. I do however believe that UCSB and institutions like it should be far cheaper than they are and should offer a substantial amount of financial aid to those who need it so that higher education is available and affordable for all people regardless of background. While I believe that student fees are important to keep our school and its services running at this point in time, I hope to see a day when education is free for all.","Mental Health, especially its impact on students, is something I have been advocating for as long as I can remember and it is a deeply important subject to me. While the current mental health services offered by UCSB are great in theory, I believe that there is definitely room for improvement and expansion. The mental health of the student body is vital to keep UCSB happy and healthy and all students should be able to access and utilize the Mental health services available on our campus as easily as possible. Improvement of these services means not only spreading awareness about them and how to access them, but also expanding them so that they have the capacity to serve the entire student body. While the current mental health services offered by UCSB have the potential to be amazing for those who know how to utilize them, I think that the entire student body deserves to enjoy that same potential.","I think that the most important thing for the university to do in instances of sexual assault is to listen to the voices of survivors and make sure that they know that the school is there to support them in whatever capacity they need. Recovery from sexual assault is different for everyone and there isn’t one solution for every survivor. While I cannot speak to the experiences of others, I know how important feeling supported is in instances of sexual assault and I believe that it should be a priority of UCSB to make sure that they offer that support in whatever way possible","There is always more that could be done to combat the challenges that underrepresented groups on our campus face everyday. The services offered to these groups by UCSB are no exception to this statement. Undeniably, UCSB and its surrounding communities do not have a great reputation when it comes to diversity but that doesn’t mean that those who are underrepresented should have any less opportunities or any less support on or off campus. The services for all underrepresented groups on campus need to be improved to make sure that there is equity amongst the whole student body because every student should have the ability to make the most of their experiences at this university.",I plan to listen to the students and their concerns first before deciding upon what actions I should take within the senate.,"One of my top concerns with AS as a student has been the lack of accessibility and communication with the student body. As a senator I would love to help implement greater transparency about what is going on within the student government such as trying to raise awareness about the actions being taken by AS as well as important events such as elections and meetings that students are free to participate in. I believe that a great first step would be to further publicize these events with resources such as flyers, social media posts, and emails that can be sent to the student body so that they are aware of what their senators are doing. This would not only improve accountability within AS but make sure that the students have an opportunity to stay informed about what's going on at their school.",I have never been in a situation similar to this so I do not feel comfortable commenting on what actions I would have taken.,"Once again, I don’t feel comfortable speaking on the issue on account that I do not know the circumstances of the actions taken.",While I do not know the circumstances behind this issue I can say that I hope to help keep things running smoothly in any way I can.

I believe that after working in the Office of the President I can continue working on the same type of projects within the Senate. I think that the Senate will also be able to expose me to new perspectives and new topics that I’ve never thought about before. It could be a very eye opening experience.,"As a first year student, I received the pleasure of being able to work in the Office of the President for the 22-23 school year. My position currently is the Senior Advisor which allows me to work on any projects that I feel need to be addressed as well as representing our president Gurleen among other organizations and entities. I believe that being Senior Advisor has given me at least a basic level of knowledge about different subject areas to be able to take a stance as a Senator. It also gave me the ability to figure what platform I would actively like to push for and ways that I can go about that.",[NO ANSWER],"My platform mainly focuses on accessibility. This year while working in the Office of the President I focused a lot on exposure. I posed questions such as: How can Associated Students be more accessible to our student body? At first this question was mainly aimed at first and second year students as I realized that not many students knew about their resources within Associated Students. Over the years I realized that I could make Associated Students as well as other resources available and accessible to everyone using a bigger platform, that being an off-campus senator.",I hope to be able to work with Multicultural organizations or entities on campus. As a Black student I feel that it is very important that our POC students know that there are many resources available to them. I would also like to work with any LGBTQIA+ organizations as well. There are many political decisions being made and discussed that can potentially affect the well being of the student body. I would like to work with these organizations to be able to create a safe space for all students who may be affected by uprising issues. I would also like to work with the Office of the President if possible to continue to work on miscellaneous projects that may come up as well.,"If elected, I will make myself as available as possible by having a calendly link where anyone can have office hours with me for about 2-4 hours a week. I will also make sure that I have dedicated times in which I’m on campus or in Isla Vista where my constituents can meet with me if they would like to. I would make sure to have these dedicated times and places on my social media so that anyone can access them.",I am the best candidate for off-campus senator because I genuinely care. I care about what happens to the student body,Left-leaning,Good,Yes,Yes,"Although I have not used the mental health services provided by UCSB, through ASOP Mental Health Commissioners, I believe that mental health services at UCSB are fair. There are many accessible and helpful resources but if there is one thing I’d like to address it would be the therapy used here. I learned a couple weeks ago that we only have very short term therapy for our students and no guarantee for longer term therapy sessions even for those who are continuing to struggle with their mental health after the set amount of sessions provided by UCSB. I believe that it is possible for UCSB to be able to provide therapists who are able to cater to our students over their 4 year experiences rather than in 5 short weeks.",[NO ANSWER],I believe that UCSB effectively serves historically underrepresented groups adequately. I do think that there is more that can be done for these groups on campus. I believe that they can be promoted more using UCSB official social media pages as well as tabling events around campus and in Isla Vista.,[NO ANSWER],[NO ANSWER],[NO ANSWER],[NO ANSWER],
